Following our theory that Covid is powered by [a Covid star](/bio/solutions/covid-star/), we list down the attributes of known variants emphasizing the date and place where they were first reported. This is to plot their "landing zones" which, according to our theory, forms a line that circles the world.

Name | Date First Encountred | Place | Transmissibility | Severity | Technical Name 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
*Original* | Dec 24, 2019 | A market in Wuhan, China | | | GH/253G.V1; B.1.526
Lambda | Aug 2020 | Peru | | | 
Zeta |  Apr 2020 | Brazil | | |  P2
*Alpha* | Oct 2020 | Kent UK | +30% | | 
*Beta* | Oct 2020 | Cape province South Africa | 50%+ | + |  
*Delta* | Oct 2020 | Maharashtra India | +80% Alpha | + | 
*Gamma* | Nov 2020 | Manus Brazil | | | 
Delta+ | Dec 2020 | Maharashtra India | +20% Delta | | 
Iota | Nov 2020 | New York | | | 
Kappa | Dec 2020 | Maharashtra, India | | |
Eta | Dec 2020 | UK and Nigeria | | | 
Theta | Feb 2021 | Japan and the Philippines | | | P.3, B.1.1.28.3
Epsilon | 2021 | California, USA | | |  GH/452R.V1
*Omicron* | Nov 24 2021 | South Africa | | | 

The pattern shows:
- that Q4 (October to December) is the time for the strongest Covid strains. 
- those variants follow the "Covid line"

These 13 variants show a regular pattern which coincides which is consistent with a cyclical universe and solar system.

We explained how Covid is caused by the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. This can be mitigated by a vegetarian diet which will reduce the need to raze forests to make room for soya farms used to feed livestock.  

The next post explains how Adam Smith was a vegetarian.
