There are 2 Domains in Reality | This leads to a physical (material) body and a metaphysical (aethereal) body
<!-- There are 5 Layers in Reality | In the physical body, the layers are called elements. In the metaphysical body, they are called strata.  -->

<!-- Bio Superphysics uses the five elements of Hindu and Taoist Sciences to explain the dynamics of life. These elements manifest as the vortices or chakras in the body which are associated with specific propensities, personalities, and diseases.  -->

The Superphysics paradigm splits reality into:
- the Metaphysical Domain
- the Physical Domain

Material Superphysics is Superphysics that deals with nonliving things.

Bio Superphysics deals with living things.

We define life as self-expressiveness or independent expression sourced from the Positiv Force.


Bio Superphysics applies the 2 domains by splitting the living organisms into:
- the physical body
- the metaphysical body

The physical body is the vehicle to receive physical perceptions and express ideas, thoughts, and reactions onto the physical domain. 

The metaphysical body is the actual organism that uses the physical body for such experiences and expressions. To avoid confusing it with other metaphysical objects, we will call it the **mental body**.  

These 2 bodies have similarities and differences.
