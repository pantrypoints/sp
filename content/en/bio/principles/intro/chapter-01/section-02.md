Everything in the physical domain is made up of some or all of the 5 Layers which we call aether, space, radiance, conversion, and matter.

In ancient Biology, this was called aether, air, fire, water, and earth.  

To differentiate it from non-living beings, and to stay consistent with ancient medicine, we will call those layers as **elements**.* 

{{< n n="If we had used 'elements' for Material Superphysics, people might confuse them with the elements in the periodic table, which is a key concept in Chemistry. The use of elements in Biology, Botany, Zoology is less common that in Chemistry. Usually, the words 'chemicals' or 'minerals' are used instead of 'elements'. And so we chose to use traditional name of Elements here." >}}


In Spiritual Superphysics, we call the layers or elements as strata:

Material | Bio | Spiritual
--- | --- | ---
Layer | Element | Strata


## The 5 Elements

Living bodies are made up of 5 Elements just like everything else in the universe.

Superphysics | Physics | Greeks (Timaeus) | Hindus | Chinese | Vietnamese
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | ? | Aether | Akasha | 水 still water | Thủy
Spatial | Gravitation | Wind | Vayu |木 moving wood | Mộc
Radiant | Electromagnetism | Fire | Tejas | 火 radiant fire | Hỏa
Convertible | Weak | Water | Jala | 土 transforming earth | Thổ
Material | Strong | Earth | Pritvi | 金 solid metal | Kim

Here are a few examples of the manifestations in each Element:

Superphysics | Manifestation
--- | --- 
Aethereal | Ideas, Abstract Mind
Spatial | Chi/Pranah/Animal Spirits
Radiant | Heartbeat, Electrical impulses
Convertible | Blood, Bodily Fluids
Material | Cells



<!-- Strata of Experience

Experience Level | Example

Universal | This Universe with the current laws of Nature
Galactic | Milky Way
Stellar | Sun
Planetary | Earth
Species | Human  -->

<!-- The human experience is the  -->

<!-- Each experience level has its own properties which are dictated by the upper layers and are related to the previous and latter ones.  -->
