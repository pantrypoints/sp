Physical energy is essential to the creation of the physical universe just as living energy is essential for the living universe. 

In Superphysics, existence begins when the Negative Force crudifies and splits up the Absolute Entity into the Supreme Entity.

This Supreme Entity then gets a hierarchy and Layers within Itself, as a higher part and a lower part.

The higher part becomes metaphysical reality coming from idea, while the lower part becomes physical reality coming from thought. 

The latter starts as aether which successively crudifies into matter as rocks, water, soil, etc.

But where does life come from? 

In Taoist and Tantric philosophy, life comes from Yang or Shiva, which we equate to the Positive Force in Superphysics.

Living Energy dominates in the metaphysical domain where the Positive is at home, just as physical energy dominates in the physical where the Negative prefers to reside. 

This is why life is relatively rare in our solar system and throughout the physical universe.

The prerequisites for life in the physical domain are:

1. Dominance of the Positive Force
2. Presence of organic matter
3. Presence of the 5 Layers in suitable ratios

Requirement 1 from our perspective is the will or desire to live. Even among humans today, this desire is weak in some, but strong in others. 

Requirement 2 is also not a problem because carbon is quite common in the universe. 

Requirement 3 is the main limiting factor. Life requires a specific range of the 5 Layers. In our solar system, this naturally is somewhat available within the habitable or Goldilocks zone.

For example, there are microorganisms in Mars and possibly in Venus. However, intelligent life is very rare. 


Material Superphysics explains the nature of Requirement 3 as the 5 Layers.
- This includes how to fight pollution and combat climate change.

Superphysics explains the nature of the Positive Force. 
- This includes the basis for our hierarchy of needs. 

It is the task of Bio Superphysics to explain how matter becomes organic and how to combine all 3 requirements to create a happy life. 

Organic matter will be explained in the Chapter on Elementals.
