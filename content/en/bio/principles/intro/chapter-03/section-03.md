Material Superphysics explains that the physical phenomena on Earth such as storms and rain are caused by our sun and by gravitational effects from other massive bodies within our solar system. 

Bio Superphysics explains that the social phenomena on Earth such as animal migration, economic crises, war, etc. are caused by starlight.

This is easily proven by starlight from the sun which we call sunlight.
- It makes human society wake up in the morning and sleep at night. 

The effects of of the sun's starlight is so obvious that we:
- take it for granted  
- see it different from the starlight of distant stars

The problem is that all other stars are very far away. And so their effects are not as clear, consistent,  or obvious as the effects of the sun. 

Even the sun cannot make 100% of all humans wake up daytime. Otherwise, night-time jobs would be impossible. 

And so this inability to produce 100% consistent effects makes it unscientific. 

We fix this by making a new discipline called Superphysics that allows consitencies of 51% to 99%. 

In this way, we can get usefulness from not-so-consistent physical phenomena to add to our toolkit of solutions to the many problems of physical existence. 

This is totally opposite of science which just throws out such possible usefulness, like how a grocery store throws out perfectly edible bananas just because it has some dark spots.

Astrology is one of the useful phenomena that is thrown away by science. 

This was useful in Asia, as proven by the Indian and Chinese astrologial systems.

Every year these Christian, Saracen, and Cathayan astrologers, each sect apart, investigate through this astrolabe the course and character of the whole year, according to the indications of each of its Moons. This is to discover by the natural course and disposition of the planets, and the other circumstances of the heavens, what shall be the nature of the weather, and what peculiarities shall be produced by each Moon of the year. For example, under which Moon there shall be thunderstorms and tempests, under which there shall be disease, murrain, wars, disorders, and treasons, and so on, according to the indications of each.  They write down the results of their examination in little pamphlets for the year, which are called Tacuin. These are sold for a groat to all who want to know what is coming. The astrologers who have the most exact predictions are held to be the greatest adepts in their art, and get the greater fame.

The success of some astrologers and the failure of others show that astrology is falsifiable or testable. In Superphysics, this shows validity since we are not after 100% hit rate, as the aethreal universe is subjective. 


As astrolgoy is subtle, using invisible space particles and patterns of light waves, it is best tested with the human chakras, specifically the heart chakra. 

Other animals, however, such as the monarch butterfly, have visual mechanisms to detect the subtle patterns in starlight.

For now, we use the following effects as examples of astrology. 


1. Earth-light: The Observer Effect

Here, reflected light from the Earth triggers the higher chakras of those who see it. 

2. Monarch Butterflies 

Some animals can detect subtle patterns in light which they use for navigation just as sailors use the North Star. 

3. The Covid Star

The starlight that shines on earth forms an energy pattern that is used by certain elementals called viruses to thrive. 

4. The War Star

The starlight from Regulus affects the lower chakras of people that it shines on.


<!-- ## Magha In 1941, Germany came under the influence of a star called Magha, a bad star. Magna causes disruption and breaks into pieces the object on which its projection falls. Now its effect is finishing, and soon a good time is coming -->
