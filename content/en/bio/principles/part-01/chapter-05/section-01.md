Viruses are not living organisms, but are merely negative aethereal idea-waves, manifesting as RNA-particles or code. These "infect" the code or DNA of actual living organisms. <!-- This means that your soul is ultimately also an idea that 'infects' your body. -->

They spread exponentially as long as there are susceptible hosts, just as rumors and fashion trends spread as long as there are minds that are susceptible to rumors and fashion trends. 

Fake news easily infects minds that have low resistance to information and are far from the truth, just as viruses easily infect those that put anything into their bodies, and are far from their natural state of health.

In other words, there has to be a match of the aethreal wave with the physical wave.

Each virus has its own nature just as there are different kinds of rumors that have varying consequences:
- Some rumors are merely irritating
- Others are lethal

The best preventative is to train your own cells to fight viruses, just as you train your mind to fact-check rumors so that they won't go deep into your beliefs. 

This changes your own aethereal waveform to have a mismatch with the virus.

This training can be done internally through vaccines, or outsourced through monoclonal antibodies. 

Likewise, rumors can be fact checked by self-effort or by asking someone more knowledgable.  

Therefore, the solutions that target the body (cause) instead of the virus (effect) will be more effective, just as educating everyone against fake news is more effective than relying on the government to shut down fake news sources.

## Possession vs Infection; Material viruses vs Aethereal viruses 

In ancient times, being infected by viruses was seen as being possessed by evil spirits which made the patient suffer and even die. To reconcile the past with the present, we can say that:
- a symptomatic person infected by a virus (or bacteria) is "possessed" by that virus
- an asymptomatic person is infected, but not possessed.

This is because unnaturally-negative propensities such as extreme greed, violence, lust, lying, etc. are also manifestations of  negative idea-waves. Greed makes a person steal or hoard, just as a virus makes a person cough and get a headache. 

From this principle, we can say that the vices of greed, violence, lust, and lying are actual possessions by the greed virus, the lust virus, and the dishonesty virus respectively. These spread through the mass media, social media, education, propaganda, advertising, etc.  

Instead of physical RNA or DNA, their information is coded in the compound ideas that go with them. 

For example, the greed virus might be encapuslated as different variants:
- mercantilism in the 17th century
- capitalism in the 19th century
- state capitalism in the 20th century
- global capitalism in the 21st century

Instead of nucleotides A-C-T-G, it can be made up of a combination of ideas selfihsness-money-profit-chance. 

Instead of being compiled into RNA, the greed virus can be compiled as a book, such as Economics by Samuelson. 

The antivirus for such greed virus are traditionally the spiritual text such as the non materialist precepts of Buddhism which have the ideas of selflessness-dharma-compassion-impermanence encapsulated in Buddhist texts. 

This is why countries like Bhutan can invent an alternative to GDP, where materialism has 100% importance, as the Gross National Happiness Index wherein material well-being is reduced to 11%. It weakens materialism to strengthen community, nature, health, education, self-development, and moral governnance.


<!-- This will lead to more technical ways to reduce the epidemic of greed, violence, lust, and lying that exist in our world today. 

For example, such people can be tested for greed and then be isolated (not jailed) if proven positive. He can then be given regular medication, as public disapproval,  and vaccination, as moral education until he stops being possessed by greed (though he may likely still be infected).  -->


In this way, Bio Superphysics crosses over onto Social Superphysics. Likewise, the principles of Social Superphysics can cross over to the medical arena in order to prevent disease.

For example, instead of the mad pursuit for money that causes exhaustion and pollution, Social Superphysics (via Economic* Superphysics) can establish a points-based system that will spread and balance out the work and revenue in society. This will then lead to less stress and pollution to reduce the chance of breeding disease.    

*Pantrypoints is the implementation of Economic Superphysics



<!-- Key Characteristics of Life (Missing in Viruses):

Cellular Structure: Living organisms are composed of cells, the fundamental unit of life. Cells contain complex machinery for metabolism, reproduction, and growth. Viruses lack this cellular structure and rely on host cells for these functions.
Metabolism: Living organisms can take in nutrients, convert them into energy, and use that energy to grow and reproduce. Viruses lack the metabolic machinery to perform these tasks independently. They rely on the host cell's metabolic processes to replicate.
Homeostasis: Living organisms can maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. Viruses don't have this ability and are susceptible to environmental changes.
Growth and Development: Living organisms grow and develop over time. Viruses assemble themselves from pre-made components within the host cell and don't exhibit independent growth.
Reproduction: Living organisms can reproduce independently, passing on their genetic information to offspring. Viruses require a host cell to replicate and cannot reproduce on their own.
Similarities Viruses Share with Living Things:

Genetic Material: Viruses contain genetic material (DNA or RNA), which carries the instructions for their structure and function.
Evolution: Viruses can mutate and evolve over time, similar to how some living organisms adapt to their environment.
In Conclusion:

While viruses exhibit some characteristics of life, their dependence on host cells for essential functions like metabolism and reproduction disqualifies them from being classified as truly alive. They exist in a unique biological niche, blurring the line between living and non-living entities. -->
