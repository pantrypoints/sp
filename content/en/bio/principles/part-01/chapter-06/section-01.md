The occult powers are written in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras.

In Bio Superphysics, these are facilitated by the 7 chakras and are expansions of latent human ability. 

1.  **Aṇimā** 

This is the power of minimization. It is the ability to condense one's consciousness into an infinitesimal point, allowing one to merge with and understand the fundamental essence of any particle, object, or idea by harmonizing with its intrinsic wavelengths.

2.  **Laghimā** 

This is the power of lightness.
- Physically, this is levitation.
- Metaphysically, it liberates the mind from material and psychic burdens, creating a carefree state essential for clear understanding.

 <!-- This weightless awareness grants the ability to perceive the subtle sorrows and unspoken sufferings in the minds of others, which is the first step toward alleviating them. (Patanjali: becoming weightless.) -->

3.  **Mahimá**

This is the power of expansion. It is the conscious enlargement of the mind's radius to encompass the entire universe. This expansive awareness fosters a direct, intuitive knowledge of all things and a profound sense of unity within the world's diversity, where benevolent thoughts contribute to universal welfare.

4.  **Īśitva**

<!-- This is the power of guidance and leadership. It enables a spiritual aspirant to effectively guide and heal minds afflicted by psychic ailments.  -->

This power is the control over material elements. An example is control of the weather, as explained by Marco Polo. 


{{< q a="Marco Polo" c="Travels of Marco Polo, Book 1, Volume 1, Chapter 61" >}}
During the 3 months of every year that the Lord resides at that place, if there is bad weather, there are crafty enchanters and astrologers in his train. They are such adepts in necromancy and the diabolic arts, that they are able to prevent any cloud or storm from passing over the Emperor’s Palace.  The sorcerers who do this are called Tebet and Kesimur [Tibet and Kashmir], which are the names of two nations of Idolaters. Whatever they do in this way is by the help of the Devil, but they make those people believe that it is compassed by dint of their own sanctity and the help of God.

This is gained not through idle wishing but through disciplined practice.


5.  **Vaśitva** 

This is power of influence. It allows one to influence people. 

This is common among religious founders. For example, the founder of Shincheonji Church of Jesus named Lee Man-hee has mentioned how he was luminous being in a rural area. This made him go read the Bible and establish his own church after failing to get support from the current churches.


6.  **Prākāmya**

The ability to reach any place or obtain anything desired. This is also achieved without Elementals through the Law of Attraction. 

<!-- Prakamya (Prākāmya): The power to realize any wish, or become invisible. //// The power of righteous desire. It represents the capacity to realize any desire, specifically when that desire is perfectly aligned with the mode of thinking aimed at universal welfare. It brings light to the world by granting aspirants exactly what is needed for global service. -->

7.  **Prāpti**

This is bilocation or access of any location by mind or matter. 

<!-- The power of attainment and grace. It signifies the ability to access any place or state of being and to help both oneself and others acquire the supreme grace. It is the culmination of spiritual practice into a state of universal benefit. -->


8.  **Antaryāmitva**  (Garima)

This is the power of inner permeation and is the most subtle of the powers. This is the capacity to mentally enter the inner psychic or material structures of others.

<!-- garima is heaviness —to directly know their pains, pleasures, hopes, and aspirations in order to guide them perfectly. This final *siddhi* is said to require not just practice, but the special grace of the Supreme Consciousness itself. -->
