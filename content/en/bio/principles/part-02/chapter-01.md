### Carbon-Oxygen

Our Pentagonic Versions of Matter puts carbon as "6" at the top of the first 5 chemical elements and the second ring in the "aether arm".

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/carbon.jpg" a="Carbon" c="Carbon is at the top of the first 5 elements" >}}

It is allied to oxygen "8" in the radiant or fire arm. This gives carbon energy upon oxygenation. 

Since the aether is the most positive of the 5 layers and since carbon is the first aether-ish element after Hydrogen, this gives it the best existential position to receive vital energy as a type of ositive Force.


### Silicon-Sulfur

Another known base of life is silicon which is tied to sulfur for its energy source to enable vital expression (the expresion of the Positive Force in Negative Matter). 

Our Pentagonic Versions show that silicon is in the convertible or water arm and is tied to sulfur which is in the aether arm. 


From here, we can say that carbon-based life is more sentient when idle just as silicon-based life is more sentient when active. 

The Mendeleev Periodic Table of Elements does not expose that connection. This is why our Pentagon is better and more useful. 



### Carbohydrates: Hydrogen-Carbon-Oxygen

Monosaccharides

Disaccharides 

Polysaccharides 

Hydrolyss is opposite of Condensation.




### Living Energy as ATP




<!-- sodium deficiency may not cause any symptoms, severe hyponatremia can lead to various health problems, including:
Muscle weakness, cramps, and spasms Headache Nausea and vomiting Confusion
Seizures Coma 

Causes of hyponatremia can include:
Drinking too much water: This can dilute the sodium concentration in your bloodstream, especially if you're sweating heavily but not replacing electrolytes.
Excessive sweating: This can cause you to lose both fluids and electrolytes, including sodium.
Certain medications: Diuretics, which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, can increase urination and lead to sodium loss.
Kidney problems: Kidneys play a role in regulating sodium levels in the body. When they're not functioning properly, they may not be able to reabsorb sodium from the urine, leading to hyponatremia.
Diarrhea and vomiting: These can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including sodium loss.
If you're concerned about your sodium levels or experience any symptoms of hyponatremia, it's crucial to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. They can assess your individual situation and recommend the best course of action, which may involve:

Limiting fluid intake: This can help prevent further dilution of sodium in your blood.
Electrolyte replacement: This may involve consuming oral rehydration solutions or receiving intravenous fluids with electrolytes.
Treating the underlying cause: If an underlying medical condition is causing hyponatremia, treating that condition is essential to address the root cause of the problem.
