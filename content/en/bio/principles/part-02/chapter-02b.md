A recent [article in IAI](https://iai.tv/articles/theres-more-to-evolution-than-genes-auid-3126) argues that evolution operates through biological self-modification rather than Darwinian random chance.

This is consistent with Bio Superphysics which supports Lamarckian evolution over the Darwinian. 
- In Darwin's system, changes emerge from the gradual accumulation of random mutations from natural selection.
- In Lamarck's system, changes are from the will of the organism and can happen quickly or slowly depending on that will or desire. 

<!-- This alternative view aligns closely with Lamarckism, particularly as articulated in Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's *Zoological Philosophy* (1809), Chapter 3, where he proposed that organisms can modify themselves in response to their environment and pass these modifications to offspring. -->


## Modern Evidence: McClintock's Jumping Genes

The article cites Barbara McClintock's groundbreaking discovery of controlling elements—Ac (Activator) and Ds (Dissociation)—now known as transposable elements or "jumping genes." 

In her 1950 PNAS paper, McClintock demonstrated that genetic elements could move within the genome in **coordinated, non-random ways**, responding to cellular stress and developmental signals.

Key findings include:

- **Non-random transposition**: Jumping genes preferentially moved not randomly throughout the genome
- **Coordinated timing**: Multiple transposable elements activated simultaneously in response to cellular conditions
- **Self-regulation**: Organisms appeared to control when and where genetic reorganization occurred

McClintock's work suggested that organisms actively modify their own heredity—a form of biological agency that contradicts the passive, random mutation model of neo-Darwinism.


## The Problem and the Solution of Descartes and Asia

Biology still **does not know know the actual mechanism for jumping genes**.

<!-- Modern biology can describe *what* happens:
- Transposable elements encode transposase proteins
- Heterochromatin marks (H3K9me3, DNA methylation) are associated with these elements
- Stress or developmental signals can activate transposition

But we cannot explain *how*:
- How does heterochromatin "decide" when to activate?
- What directs non-random targeting of insertion sites?
- How are multiple transposable elements coordinated simultaneously?
- What mechanism translates organismal state into specific genomic reorganization?

We know these events occur outside the genes themselves, in the heterochromatin. But the causal mechanism remains mysterious. -->

Unknown to many, René Descartes already gave the mechanistic explanation over 350 years ago in *Description of the Human Body* (1664).

He proposed that **animal spirits**—subtle fluids flowing through the body—direct cellular growth and development.

In Descartes' framework:
- Animal spirits flow through cells, carrying information and directive force
- These spirits originate from a central organizing point
- They guide the formation and modification of bodily structures

This concept directly parallels:
- **Chi (氣)** in Taoism—the vital energy flowing through meridians
- **Vayu** in Hinduism—the life force circulating through the body
- **Prana** in yogic traditions—the organizing principle of life


## The Pineal Gland and Evolutionary Control

According to these traditions, these organizing forces emanate from specific control centers:

**In humans**: The pineal gland (corresponding to the crown chakra or sahasrara) serves as the primary organizing center. This suggests that human evolution begins not at the genetic level, but from this central coordinating point.

**In other organisms**: The controlling center varies by species:
- Some plants: the roots serve as the organizing center
- Others: the seed contains the directive principle
- The location adapts to the organism's structure and needs


## Practical Applications: Healing Through Self-Direction

This framework explains why Asian healing techniques that work with chi and chakras can accelerate healing:

- **Mindfulness meditation**: Directs conscious attention to influence the body's organizing forces
- **Pranic healing**: Manipulates subtle energy flows to restore balance
- **Qigong and tai chi**: Cultivate and direct chi for health and vitality
- **Yoga**: Works with prana through breath and posture to influence bodily processes

These aren't merely psychological—they represent conscious engagement with the same mechanisms that direct cellular modification and, potentially, evolutionary change.


## Reclaiming Agency: Descartes + Lamarck

The synthesis of Descartes' animal spirits with Lamarck's self-modification presents an empowering positive alternative to neo-Darwinian randomness, negativity, and helplessness:

**Neo-Darwinian view**: 
- Random mutations occur by chance
- Natural selection filters variants
- Organisms are passive recipients of change
- Control is external (environmental pressure)

**Descartes-Lamarck synthesis**:
- Organisms actively modify themselves
- Animal spirits/chi direct cellular and genetic changes
- Organisms respond purposively to challenges
- Control is internal (organismal self-direction)

This returns **agency to the organism itself**. Evolution becomes something organisms *do* rather than something that *happens to them*.


## Implications for Understanding Life

This perspective suggests:

1. **Top-down causation**: Organismal state influences genetic organization, not just bottom-up from DNA
2. **Purposive adaptation**: Organisms can direct their own modification toward functional ends
3. **Consciousness and evolution**: Awareness and intention may influence biological change
4. **Healing and transformation**: We may have more control over our biology than modern medicine assumes


## The Path Forward

Modern biology has accumulated vast molecular detail since McClintock's work, but it has not explained the *mechanism* she observed. 

The answer is not in more molecular reduction, but in recognizing the metaphysical principles described by Descartes, Lamarck, and ancient wisdom traditions.

This is in line with a core Superhysics principle that physicality is directed ultimately by metaphysicality. 

You get out of your bed to go to work because you BELIEVE you need to go to work to earn money to live. 

So it is still your metaphysical belief that drives your actions, changes, and your evolution. 

Belief is based on ideas and feelings. 

So we use Positive, spiritual feelings to get positive ideas and push them to dislodge negative ones that currently cause ignorance and suffering. 

In this case, we push Descartes-Lamarck over Darwin so that people can choose how to evolve, change, and heal themselves instead of being slaves to chance and uncertainty. 



<!-- The heterochromatin that houses jumping genes may be the physical substrate through which animal spirits/chi/prana operate—the interface between the organism's purposive self-organization and its material implementation.

By integrating these perspectives, we move toward a biology that:
- Recognizes organismal agency
- Explains coordinated self-modification
- Reunites ancient wisdom with modern science
- Returns control of life to the living being itself

The question is no longer whether organisms can modify themselves—McClintock proved they do. The question is whether we're ready to accept that this self-modification may be directed by principles our ancestors understood, even if our current scientific framework cannot yet accommodate them. -->

<!-- 
The article asserts that evolution is from biological self-modification instead of Darwinian random chance. 

This is in line with Lamarckism specifically written in Zoological Philosophy Chapter 3. 

The article cites Barbara McClintock's controlling elements as Ac and Ds called transposable elements or jumping genes: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.36.6.344

The big problem for biology is that they don't know the mechanism for jumping genes. They just know that it happens outside the genes in the heterochromatin.

But Descartes already fully explained this in Description of the Human Body 1664 through his concept of animal spirits which flow through the cells and direct cellular growth.

The animal spirits are called chi in Taoism and vayu in Hinduism. These emanate from the pineal gland (crown chakra). i.e. human evolution starts from the pineal gland.

In lesser organism, it begins in the controlling center of the organism. This center varies. For example, in some plants it is in the roots, in others it is in the seed

This is why there are Asian techniques to heal faster by using chi and chakra (e.g. mindfulness, pranic healing, etc). 

So Descartes + Lamarck show how organism evolve themselves instead of relying on chance. This gives the control of life back to the self instead of external causes.
