Blood is a fluid that is made up of:
- red blood cells (erythrocytes)
- white blood cells (leukocytes)
- platelets in a plasma

A healthy person has approximately 5 liters of blood.


## Blood Types

At the beginning of the 20th century, Austrian scientist Karl Landsteiner noted that the red blood cells of some individuals were clumped by the serum from other individuals.

This led to his groundbreaking discovery of the ABO blood group system in 1900.

Red blood cells have the A antigen, B antigen, both, or neither:

| Blood Type | Antigens on Red Blood Cells | Antibodies in Plasma        | Transfusion Notes |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| A    | A antigen                   | Anti-B antibodies           | Can receive A or O blood |
| B    | B antigen                   | Anti-A antibodies           | Can receive B or O blood |
| AB   | A and B antigens            | None                        | Universal recipient (can receive A, B, AB, or O) |
| O    | None                        | Anti-A and Anti-B antibodies| Universal donor (can donate to all ABO types); can receive only O |

- Rh-positive individuals can receive Rh+ or Rh- blood
- Rh-negative individuals must receive Rh- blood


The 4 Blood Types match the 4 properties of waves. 

Blood Type | Wave Property
---|---
A    | Density
B    | Balance
AB   | Spread
O    | Commonality


## The Rh Factor: Positive or Negative

The presence of an antigen called the Rh protein or rhesus factor means the blood Rh positive. 
- This was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys
- In our proposed Bio Superphysics, Rh+ means that the person is less capable of advanced ideas as the monkey propensity is stronger

Around 82% of people in the United States have Rh-positive blood, making Rh-negative blood relatively rare. This is why the human species is relativelty backward compared to advanced alien species like the Grays, Anunnaki, and Essassani.

This creates 8 main blood types:

1. A+
2. A-
3. B+
4. B-
5. AB+
6. AB-
7. O+
8. O-


Both ABO genes and Rh factors are passed down from parents, though due to the many possible combinations, you might not have the exact same blood type as either parent.


## Why Blood Types Matter: Transfusion Safety

The immune system recognizes blood type markers (antigens) as either "self" or "foreign." 

Some antigens can trigger a patient's immune system to attack the transfused blood.
- And so safe blood transfusions depend on careful blood typing and cross-matching.

If incompatible blood is transfused, the recipient's antibodies immediately attack the foreign red blood cells, causing them to clump together.

The most common cause of death from a blood transfusion is a clerical error where an incompatible type of ABO blood is transfused.

<!-- ## Rare Blood Types

As of June 2025, a total of 48 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. Beyond ABO and Rh, there are over 300 other known antigens that can affect transfusion compatibility.

Some rare blood group systems include:
- Duffy blood group
- Kell blood group
- Lutheran blood group
- Kidd blood group

One of the world's rarest blood types is Rh-null, with fewer than 50 people worldwide having this blood type—sometimes called "golden blood". -->

O and A are the most common blood types. B- and AB- are the rarest.

2. **Europe is unique**: Only region where A+ rivals or exceeds O+
3. **B+ concentration**: Highest in Asia (India, China) and Middle East
4. **Rh- is rare**: Only 7% globally, concentrated in Caucasian populations
5. **Indigenous patterns**: Native populations (Americas, Africa) show strong O+ dominance
6. **East Asian uniqueness**: Almost complete absence of Rh- blood types



<!-- 
Evidence suggests that the evolution of blood types may be driven by genetic selection for those types whose antigens confer resistance to particular diseases in certain regions—such as the prevalence of blood type O in malaria-endemic countries where individuals of blood type O exhibit the highest rates of survival.

## Special Consideration: Pregnancy and the Rh Factor

The Rh system is particularly important during pregnancy. If the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive, this can cause erythroblastosis fetalis or hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which the mother's immune system attacks the fetus's red blood cells.

Since the 1970s, this condition has been largely prevented through RhoGAM injections administered to Rh-negative mothers during pregnancy, which prevent the mother's immune system from producing antibodies against the Rh antigen.

## Blood Types and Health

Numerous associations have been made between particular blood types and disease susceptibility. For example:
- Stomach ulcers are more common in type O individuals
- Gastric cancer is more common in type A individuals
- Type O individuals tend to have lower levels of von Willebrand Factor, a protein involved in blood clotting

However, people with the common blood type O express neither the A nor B antigen, and they are perfectly healthy. Having any particular blood type doesn't make a person's blood healthier or stronger—it's simply a genetic difference, like having different eye colors or hair textures.

## The Ongoing Need for Blood Donation

Nearly 16 million blood components are transfused each year in the United States. Blood transfusions remain one of the most frequent lifesaving procedures hospitals perform, yet significantly fewer people donate than are needed to meet demand.

Understanding your blood type and donating blood when possible is more than just a medical contribution—one blood donation can save up to three lives.

## Conclusion

The discovery of blood types transformed medicine from a dangerous gamble into a precise science. What was once invisible—the molecular markers on our red blood cells—now guides one of the most common lifesaving medical procedures. From Landsteiner's initial observations over a century ago to today's recognition of 48 blood group systems, our understanding continues to deepen, making blood transfusion increasingly safe and expanding our knowledge of human genetic diversity and evolutionary adaptation. -->
