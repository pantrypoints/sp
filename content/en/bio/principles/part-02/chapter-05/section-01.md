Cells function according to the programming stored in their DNA. 

DNA is madeup of nucleic acids which is made up of nucleotides, as nucleobases, which actually have the data or programming.

We can think of the helix as a cellular organic vortex, and the nucleotides as the information within that vortex. 

Each nucleotide has 3 components:

Component | Version of Matter | Influence or Guna
--- | --- | --- 
Ribose and Deoxyribose | Carbon 6 | Subtlifying
Nucleobase | Nitrogen 7 | Transformative 
Phosphate Group | Phosphorus 15 | Crudifying


The Phosphate group links the Carbon and Nitrogen.

The main body that interacts with the physical world is the Nucleobase component.

Nucleobases | Base Type | Layer 
--- | --- | ---
Thymine (T) | Pyrimidine | Aether
Cytosine (C) | Pyrimidine | Air
Adenine  (A) | Purine | Fire
Guanine (G) | Purine | Water
Uracil (U) | Pyrimidine | Earth


These nucleobases have fixed combinations, matching the nature of the Convertible Layer. 

Purine has 2 carbon rings with 4 nitrogen atoms

Pyrimidine has 1 pyrimidine ring and 2 nitrogen atoms


ATP is the energy of the vortex. 



### Chromosomes

Chromatid
Centromere
P short arms
Q long arms
Telomeres - these get shorter with every division until the cell dies
