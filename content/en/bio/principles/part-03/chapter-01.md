Superbiology adds the following observations about the hidden or unknown abilities or features of plants  

1. Growth by Moonlight 
2. Rainwater Magnet
3. Chi Generation 
4. Information Network

### Moonlight

Some Plants prefer moonlight over sunlight. This is because the direct light of the sun might be hurtful to them just as they might hurt some people with sensitive skin. 

An example of moonlight-affected plant is Basil. Such plants should be give maximum exposure to moonlight. 


### Rain Magnets

It is known in Asia that certain plants can attract rain clouds. Examples are:
- sirisha [Albizzia lebbeck benth.]
- shisu [Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.]
- Himalayan white oak [Quercus incana Roxb.]
- ferns

Ferns are known to thrive in rainforests and is one of the causes of the existence of such rainforests. 


### Chi Generation

Chi or animal spirits is a metaphysical energy that affects living organisms, just as physical energy affects nonliving things.

These are the organic version of virtual space particles called the 2nd Element that cause gravity and dark matter effects. In humans, this is harnessed through telekinesis and by levitating Buddhist monks. 

Since telekinesis via chi is like using the human body to pump already-existing organic virtual space particles, then plants give of chi as pumps gathering the chi from the air and the ground. 

Five trees (paiṋcavati) are known to give off positive chi:

1. Nimbá (margosa)
2. Bilva (wood apple)
3. Shalmali (silk cotton tree)
4. Bat (banyan indica)
5. Ashvatha (Indian fig tree)

The air of the margosa tree:
- destroys the harmful effects of bacteria
- can fight against negative chi

<!-- In the olden days, people liked to perform spiritual practices sitting in an environment free from the pernicious effects of disease and germs.

That is why they would plant paiṋcavati in and around the place of meditation or spiritual practice: -->

Some people of course use ámlakii (wood sorrel) as a substitute plant. In paiṋcavati, mahánimba may be planted instead of ordinary margosa.


There are other abilities newly known by Biology.


### Information Network via Tubes

The roots of plants share information through Mycelial networks. These are made up of fungi called Mycelium. 

Fungi are scavengers of the plant world just like vultures are of the animal world.

These convert prana-reduced organic matter into new chemical structures like nutrients which are then serve as new material for growth. 

To do so, the fungi need to have channels as hyphae. This turns them into a tube network for prana and lifetrons which transmits both energy and information, just as electrons transmit both energy and information.  

This is why Hindus and Jains do not eat fungi, as they are prana-reduced.
