There were 3 main European theories for evolution: Creationism, Darwinism, and Lamarckism. 

Creationism believes that traits were created or engineered by a divine being.

This is consistent with the Anunnaki creating humans from homo erectus. 

This is now seen in genetically modified organisms where humans play as God.

Darwinism believes that traits were evolved slowly by chance through the need to survive.

This leads to negative competitive behavior. 

This gained traction because Europeans have a mentality of dominating others, as seen in the Roman Empire, colonialism, and capitalism.

Darwinism was used by Hitler to justify the Holocaust. 

Modern Biologists try to correct this with the idea of altruism and inclusive fitness.

Lamarckism believes that traits evolve slowly through willpower or desire. 

This is consistent with the Law of Attraction.

Evolution is by will, not chance!

We classify genetic creationism as evolution by the will of a 3rd person. This includes breeding or artificial selection.

We classify Lamarckism as evolution by the positive will of a 1st person or the self. 

Darwinism is by the negative will and should be discouraged just as harmony is better than competition.

Supereconomics uses this to explain why civilizations decline after they become rich and lazy. 

Countries lose their manufacturing skill -- this is what is happening to the US and EUrope.
