Abortion is not genocide. 

Before the fetus is 7 weeks old, it is just a bunch of cells and has no independent soul. This is called the heartbeat law in the US. 

So abortion before the 7th week is echnically not murder just as a woman that has her period is not guilty of murdering her eggs. 

But Catholics have no concept of science and metaphysics and so they have wrong beliefs about the nature of consciousness, life, and mind. 

China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan were lucky enough not to be Catholic nor Muslim. And so they allow abortions and do not have stupid dogma.

Even the Europeans got rid of their religion after their Englightenment. 

As a result their populations have not gone over the natural carrying capacity of their land's productivity.

In contrast, Philippines, Honduras, Brazil, Poland have Catholicism and so abortion there is banned or restricted. 

As a result, their population is beyond their country's carrying capacity. This manifests as Philippines having OFWs, and why South Americans do caravans towards the US, most notably Honduras. 

In the US, American women are fighting tooth and nail to allow abortion, opposite here where people fight to ban abortion.
