<!-- In Mayan history, Enlil is Tepeu and Enki is Gucumatz. 
Enlil is the leader (God), Enki is the jealous usurper (snake). Accordingly, Gucumatz is a snake.

Our **Anunnaki Hypothesis** states that humans were created by the Anunnaki in order to help them [mine gold](/research/ancient/sumerian/enki/part-04/).

According to the Essassani, the Anunnaki are an alien species from Cygnus constellation. Their planet was heating up and like ours and so they needed atomized gold in their stratosphere to keep it cool. 


{{< q a="Enki" c="Enki and Ninhursaja, Part 3" >}}
Let the magilum boats of Meluḫa transport gold and silver and bring them to Nibru for Enlil, king of all the lands.
{{< /q >}}


This explains:
- why humans are the only intelligent species on Earth
- why all human civilizations have gold ornamentation

Note that this excludes uncivilized humans such as savages. This has been explained as the early variations done by the Anunnaki.

This creation was done through genetic engineering by mixing parts of the Anunnaki DNA with the Homo Erectus species that was already present on Earth.

### The Four Races

After some trial and error with the first batches, [the Anunnaki](https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/edition2/etcslbycat.php) finally made the [four proper races](/research/ancient/mayan/popol/part-3/chapter-02/) 


{{< q a="Popol Vu, Part 3, Chapter 2" >}}
These are the names of the first men created:
1. Balam-Quitzé
2. Balam-Acab
3. Mahucutah
4. Iqui-Balam

They only were made and formed. They had no mother and no father. They were not born of woman, nor were they begotten by the Creator nor by the Maker, nor by the Forefathers. Only by a miracle, by means of incantation were they created and made by Tepeu and Gucumatz.. They were endowed with intelligence. They saw and instantly they could see far, they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world.

<!-- The problem was that  -->

## The Deluge

The most advanced humans were the Atlanteans who were located in the Bahamas, and were split between good and bad.

The bad Atlanteans wanted to dominate the world and defeat the Anunnaki who were headquartered in the Middle East. 

Greece was the last Anunnaki stronghold before reaching the Middle East. And so the Anunnaki decided to build a fort at Athens. 


{{< q a="Priest of Sais" c="Timeaus by Plato" >}}
A goddess founded your city Athens 1,000 years before ours in order to repulse the invasion from Atlantis receiving from the Earth and Hephaestus the seed of your race.
{{< /q >}}



Because of this aggression from humans, the Anunnaki leader Enlil decided to destroy the human species. 

And so the Anunnaki used the weapons of Tiamat to draw in comets to crash into Atlantis.

The Essassani clarify that:
- these comets were the Taurid meteor showers which hit the earth twice a year for 20 years around 10,800 BC
- the comet that crashed was a bigger version of comet Encke


The Atlanteans were mentioned as the Atra-Hasis in The Epic of Gilgamesh.


## What We Do With This

We can look at the postive aspects of humans as a genetic engineering product. 

For example, instead of focusing on the human lust for gold and material objects, we can focus on the ability of humans to follow instructions and work for the benefit of others.
