Have you ever wondered why Covid and influenza are prevalent in Europe but not in Africa? 

<!-- Thanks to the Omicron variant, we can now conclusively answer this with real data and explain the causes and dynamics of both Covid and the flu virus. -->

## Life (and Viruses) Come from Matter but are Powered by Stars

According to science:
- all life comes from matter in a process called [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis).
- all matter comes from stars when the explode or fizzle out


Material Superphysics explains that there are 2 kinds of spaces:

1. The space outside atoms

This is called spacetime. This is a dead force, as explained by George Berkeley.

{{< q a="George Berkeley" c="Motus, Section 8" >}}
The *dead force*, or simple gravitation in a body at rest, produces no observable change and hence no effect. But impact does.
{{< /q >}}


2. The space inside atoms. This is can have either dead or living force, as explained by PR Sarkar. 

This is called aetherspace, and is called citta in Vedic and Tantric philosophy.  

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology" >}}
The Macrocosm gives [metaphysical] momentum to the crude mind [in matter] towards the process of subtilification. Biologically, this means that life evolved from organic matter.
{{< /q >}}


This means that:
- life comes from the aethespace of an object
- the power for living comes from the aetherspace of external radiating bodies such as hydrothermal vents or stars

This life radiation is called prana in Sanskrit and is part of the Radiant Layer (or 1st Element in Cartesian Physics).

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/vents.jpg" a="Vents" >}}

This is easily proven by the fact that most life on Earth needs the sun's energy. 

<!-- For example, everything we do as humans totally depends on our sun. If the sun vanishes, then we all die out. Because of this, some early human civilizations have worshipped the sun, which is really the worship of a star.  -->

Viruses on the surface of the Earth depend on their star. 

We imagine a Covid star shining on Earth to empower the corona virus which began in China on Dec 24, 2019.
- We then add the other successful variants as "Covid landings" noting the rotation and revolution of Earth relative to the Covid Star.
- This creates a "Covid Equator" or "Covid Line" which starts from the UK then goes to China, India, South Africa, and Brazil. 

![The Covid Star](/graphics/bio/covidstar.jpg)

We then apply this technique to influenza. 

According to "[The Latitude Effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307116/)" (Almeida, Codeço, Luz), flu travels from North Brazil to Southern Brazil from May to July. 

So we lay the Earth on its side to create a "Flu Line" extending this line from Brazil onto Australia, China, Russia, Europe, and North America. 

From this, we see that Africa is:
- totally exempt from the flu line and
- partially exempt from the Covid line (except South Africa). 

This explains why flu is historically negligible in Africa and Covid is low. 

![The Covid Line and Flu Line](/graphics/bio/covidline.jpg)

Southern China, on the other hand, is traversed by both the Covid line and the flu line. 

This explains why 12th centry historian *Chau Ju Kua* called Southern China a region of pestilence. This caused Chinese medicine to specialize in flu cases which has helped China to currently have lower cases than the West. 

China was able to take a negative phenomenon and make it positive, in line with Taoist thinking.

This star-based analysis is a kind of out-of-the-box reasoning which we derived from [Johannes Kepler](/research/kepler) who taught people to view phenomena from the perspective of stars and not humans.   

From here, we can suggest the following policies:

1. Focus vaccination and lockdowns on the "Covid line countries" from November to February. This would be like preemptive strikes on Covid landing zones to prevent them from gaining a foothold. China currently does this. 
2. Move the Holidays and Lunar New Year to June-July
3. Tap the long experience of China-Taiwan on flu prevention and treatment*
4. By extending Kepler's Harmonic Ratios, we hypothesize that the Spanish Flu ended with the end of WWI which cut the harmonic link between the Flu star and Earth. So we likewise suggest to end the War against the Amazon rainforest to cut the link between the Covid star and Earth to make Covid harmless like the flu


{{< n n="*China treats 85% of the COVID-19 patients using [traditional medicines](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.928106/full) such as root extract of Isatis indigotica and extract of Houttuynia cordata" >}}

### The Spanish Flu was from the Covid Star

The Spanish Flu emerged in Kansas in the US on March 4, 1918. It spread to France and then throughout Europe by May and then declined.

In the US, it reappeared as a second wave from September to November 2018 notably in Philadelphia, Boston, and San Fransisco.

The fact that the second wave around Q4 was worse than the first wave of Q1 forms a pattern consistent with the Covid Star. The Spanish Flu naturally died out after World War 1 ended and this forms our advocacy to end the war against the Amazon to end the Covid pandemic.

### How we cracked Covid via Regular Patterns

By combining the Physics of Descartes and Kepler with the Physics of Hinduism and Taoism, we can distill the geometric, pattern-based mechanism for astrological phenomena: 


{{< q a="Kepler" c="The Firmer Fundaments of Astrology" >}}
Two planets so effectively increases the actual bend of an aspect. This is because of a vital capability.

1. On one side, this capability dwells in the capacity of the **geometrical pattern** and which forms the aspects. [spacetime]
2. On the other side, this dwells in the capability of the body in which all this operates, in which that influence fulfills [aetherspace]
{{< /q >}}


This pattern emerged thanks to the Omicron variant striking in South Africa near the same month as the Beta variant which struck that country earlier in 2020. 

This actual pattern was different from [our original spreading pattern prediction](/social/supersociology/strong-christmas) which assumed that the causal mechanism for the successful variants was merely the high volume of infections or hosts. High populations increase the chances for such variants to succeed.

Thus, this assumption is "chance-based" and predicted the Omicron emerging in Indonesia or Malaysia by Q4 2021. 

Instead, Omicron showing up in South Africa proved to us that Covid follows a more-predictable 'cyclical pattern' like influenza which has a known pattern:
- May-July in the Southern Hemisphere
- December-February in the Northern Hemisphere

But unlike influenza which is active all-year round, Covid is active mosty during the fourth quarter of the year. 

By applying the orbital theories of Johannes Kepler, we guesstimated that a Covid star* was 'underneath' the sun on a far side. This caused the earth to come near it (aphelion) during the fourth quarter of its orbital revolution.

{{< f f="*This assumption is based on the dynamics of the Earth relative to the cosmos and is pattern-based or orbit-based" >}}

<!-- Rio. China is the middle area between   -->

The Flu star, on the other hand, was either on top or below of the sun. This caused it to affect influenza on Earth evenly throughout the year.  <!-- but nearly perpendicular to the Earth's axis.    --> These stars are then within our own Milky Way since flu has been happening in Southern China for hundreds of years. 


## Solves Monarch Butterflies Too

The idea of stars guiding life on earth is also seen in the migration routes of monarch butterflies. 

These are born at the end of August in Mexico and fly into into the southern US in the spring, living for 7-8 months. Their offspring are born in the US, living only 3-5 weeks. These short-lived versions then fly back to Mexico.

![Monarch Butterflies](/graphics/bio/monarch.jpg)

How could such an offspring generation know to go to Mexico without being taught by their parents?

Science explains that the monarchs have some kind of magnetic guidance system from the Earth's magnetic field. This is wrong because it establishes the cause as being on the Earth itself. If so, then various other creatures should also go to that spot in Mexico. 

 <!-- does not explain how the latter generations can find their way back to Mexico. Where do the younger butterflies get the memory to fly back from the US to Mexico? -->

We explain that the butterflies are guided by starlight from a specific star or group of stars.  This is similar to us being guided to go West or East based on the position of the sun relative to the Earth without any magnetic tool or sense.

This also does not require any memory of past locations. All it needs is an optical system designed by genetics to tap into the wavelength of that star.

Accordingly, Monarch Butterflies are known for having complex eyes compared to other insects. 

Case closed. 

<!-- The monarchs that spend the winter in Mexico are a unique generation from those that we see for most of the summer in Wisconsin. Born at the end of August, they have more streamlined wings and delay developing reproductive organs so they can allocate their energy to migrating from northern sites to winter grounds and back north into southern US in the spring. Monarchs in this generation live to be a whopping 7-8 months, rather than 3-5 weeks like other generations.  Credit: Journey North. -->
