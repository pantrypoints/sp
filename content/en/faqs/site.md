Why are there so many unfinished pages or content that look like draft?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We're really short of manpower, yet we have so much content to upload. So we just put up the titles and a few draft paragraphs for SEO (Google) to catch. Then we see which pages or articles get views. Then we work on those. 

So if you see a messy page, then it means very few people have viewed it or was not picked up by SEO.

Why are there broken links?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Sometimes, we find a better arrangement for the content and we transfer them or merge them with others. This is common during [breaking changes](/news/changes).

I want you to explain a certain phenomenon using your Superphysics, or simplify a scientific work of a 16th century author. 

Or I want to validate whether a claim or idea by an inventor, such as a Star Trek style replicator that disassembles and reassembles atoms, will be possible in Superphysics. 

How can I do that?
