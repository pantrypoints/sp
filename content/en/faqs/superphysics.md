## Basics 

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What is Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Superphysics is the merging of Science and Metaphysics without going into the details of either. It acts as a bridge between ancient metaphysics and modern science, as explained by Francis Bacon.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified, Book 2 Part 7" >}}
Natural science or theory is divided into physic and metaphysic.
- Physic should contemplate that which is inherent in matter, and therefore transitory.
- Metaphysic should contemplate that which is abstracted and fixed.
- Physic should handle that which supposeth in nature only a being and moving.
- Metaphysic should handle that which supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding, and platform.
{{< /q >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So it's pseudo-science because it has metaphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
No. Superphysics upgrades science by adding metaphysics, similar to how Android is an upgrade of cellphones by adding installable apps. Do we call a Samsung Android as a pseudo-Nokia 3310? 
{{< /l>}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
No. We call it a 'smart-phone'
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Correct. We add the word 'smart.' Similarly, we add 'super' to 'physics' to signify an upgrade. This is supported by Francis Bacon who called 'natural magic' as part of metaphysics.
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Book 2 Part 1, The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified" >}}
Superstitious narrations of sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinations, and the like, where there is an assurance and clear evidence of the fact, **SHOULD NOT** be excluded altogether. This is because it is not yet known in what cases and how far effects attributed to superstition do participate of natural causes. Therefore, howsoever the practice of such things is to be condemned, yet from the speculation and consideration of them, light may be taken for the further understanding of Nature.   
{{< /q >}}


## 6-sense Upgrade

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
In its simplest defintion, Superphysics is a **formal discipline** that explains how Existence works. So it is not a science, philosophy, belief, or ideology. 
- "science" implies a rejection of the metaphysical
- "philosophy" implies a lack of evidence and replicability
- "belief" or "ideology" implies something not universal
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Formal discipline implies actual systemic practice just like engineering, law, music, business, accounting, software development, etc.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. It emphasizes actual practice just as how gravity actually presses on us right now and will continue to press on us always. We do not say we have a belief in gravity. Nor there is a philosophy of gravity.  
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
But formal disciplines have some document or theory to back them up. For example:
- music has music theory as octaves and rhythm names
- software development has documentation
- Christianity has a Bible, Islam has a Quran
- accounting has generally accepted principles
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We have principles too. These are derived from Socratic Dialectics, since Superphysics is a Socratic discipline that is embodied in "Guardians"
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's Socratic Dialectics? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
[Socratic Dialectics](/dialectics) makes up the core of the 'super' upgrade as a process of exhaustive data gathering, probing, and experimenting that uses the 6th sense called intuition or higher mind which Socrates called the 'higher principle'. 

You could say that the 5 senses detect visible particles and objects, while the 6th sense detects invisible waves and patterns. Most people only use the 5 senses. A very few use all 6 senses. Of those very few, only a handful have the intellect to connect everything and solve problems.
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified" >}}
He leaves this higher principle in pure abstraction when the lower and higher principle clash. He rouses up the third principle which is reason... The intellectual sphere has a lower part where the soul uses the shapes given by the higher part as images. Enquiries here does not go upwards to a higher principle.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- 
r a="Asker" >}}
How is Socratic Dialectics different from Dialectics?
/r >}}

  hijacked dialectics and made his own version based an his own matter-based metaphysics (as 'substance'). The Germans, like Kant, Engels, Marx, and Einstein followed Aristotle.  -->

<!--  l a="Superphysics" >}}
Socratic Dialectics uses timeless metaphysical truths as the quality control for logic. Its rival is Aristotlean and Marxist dialectics which uses either the ego or matter (materialism). These have led to:
- Economic Materialism which has caused financial crises and poverty
- Dialectical Materialism which has led to Marxism and Communism 
- Scientism which has limited Physics to the 3 Elements (Strong Force, Weak Force, Electromagnetism) and has kept the 2 higher Elements (Spacetime and Aether) out of reach, undiscovered. As a result, humans are unable to spread themselves to Mars or even to the Moon.

The enlightened philosophers like Bacon, Hume, and Ibn-Khaldun denounced Aristotle. So we are fully in the Pythagoras-Plato-Descartes-Spinoza-Hume-Hinduism-Buddhism-Taoism camp. Socratic Dialectics also throws away Ontology and Epistemology, replacing them with logic and feelings.  
 /l >}} -->


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How sure are you that Superphysics can solve what Science cannot?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Because we absorb all data, information, and human knowledge, even from [Asia](/research/ancient/babylonian/enuma/tablet-01/), [Maya](/research/ancient/mayan/popol/part-1/chapter-01/), [Hinduism](/research/indian/gospel/intro/part-01/), [Buddhism](/research/buddha/), Taoism, even human information about [aliens](/research/other/alien/essassani/basics/) (to test whether our principles also hold true in other planets and are therefore universal). 

Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism allow other dimensions by default. Even Islam has the concept of [Jinns](/research/mohammad/quran/sura-072). This gives us a bigger data set from which we can test their own principles on our reality. This is different from Roman philosophy which was ignorant on metaphysics. The Romans did not know about other dimensions or how to detect or access them. The Roman mentality evolved to be Western thinking and science which only deal with the obvious and shallow perceptions.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- Notice how Roman gods just mirror human characteristics.  and subsequently as the limited Western Science  -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How do you weed out junk ideas like faeries, ghosts, and evil spirits?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
By seeing if we can detect them through 6-senses and then analyze them through Socratic Dialectics. If you want to detect bacteria, you get a microscope. To get the microscope, you have to shell out money which you earn from the effort in your job, or by doing the effort to make a microscope yourself. 

Likewise, gaining the skill to detect the invisible metaphysical domain requires continuous training and effort, since your mind is the detector itself, as explained by Rene Descartes' concept of "[animal spirits](/research/descartes/passions/article-010/)". We then compare the person's description of faeries, ghosts, etc. to a data set of known properties from various cultures, such as India, China, and other cultures which have a lot of data on Elementals, to see whether they match and therefore are predictable, or whether it is just the mind playing tricks.
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Treatise on Man" >}}
Thus, in this way chimeras and hippogriffs are created in the imagination of people who dream while awake. They let loose their imagination through laziness, not diverted by any external objects, nor governed by reason.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- By finding consistent patterns from data. The patterns are then extrapolated and interpolated to lead to predictions that can be tested in the real world. Do you have data on faeries and pixie dust? -->
<!-- I don't have any.  So there's nothing to test. We reject its reality until we can test it. But unlike close-minded science that automatically rejects its **possible** existence, we do not deny its possibility. 

Perhaps they are real in another universe which has different Physics from ours, but only their aether-components cross over into the aethereal (abstract) minds of some people as aethereal ideas. Their brains then interpret those ideas as faeries and pixie dust. -->

<!-- r a="Asker" >}}
Those [Elementals](/bio/principles/part-01/chapter-01/) are the 'gods' worshipped by the polytheist Hindus, right?  
/r >}}

l a="Superphysics" >}}
No. Those Elementals are "Nature Spirits" which humans tap for some utility just as we tap plants for food and our pet dogs to guard the house or keep us company. We sometimes adore our pets, but never worship them. 

In Asian countries, these are the spirits that you make offerings to, in order to get something back. In Christian countries, these manifest as the saints that you pray to, in order to get some real-world blessing or benefit. It is this real-world benefit that makes them fall within the scope of Superphysics. Without any real effects, we wouldn't waste time on it. But since there are real effects facilitated by exchange, then we can systematically "domesticate" them to create an "Elemental industry", similar to how early humans domesticated plants and animals to create agriculture and animal husbandry.  
/l >}} -->

<!--  If all five continents have oral tradition of faeries and pixie dust that survive up to modern times as to be testable, then there's some reality to it. But we find that there are none, so we cross it out as untrue.

Truth is the equality of perceptions. We're after true patterns that lead to the single truth, as the cause behind an issue or problem. This single truth represents the totality of perception.  -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So the consistency of people around the world (who don't talk to each other) having common perceptions of "Nature Spirits" and "Gaia" is proof of a different reality or universe or dimension above ours?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- , innate, abstract, aethereal, or spiritual ideas  -->

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. All cultures have similar a belief in another type of reality, and of a Supreme Being that administers that reality as well as ours. Modern science discards such information as imaginary or hallucinations, instead of studying the consitency or inconsistency of the data. But Superphysics embraces that data to test that reality and that Being.  
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So what have you found?
{{< /r >}}

 <!-- etc. and that  It. Parmenides calls It The One, and the Chinese call It The Tao. This is similar to the idea that Descartes and Hegel had, despite them using non-Asian techniques. -->


## The Matrix

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We found that we are actually **inside** the Supreme Being that they call God, Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Brahma, or whatever, and that everything inside it is generated **in real-time** through the wave function collapse in Quantum Mechanics. 

This is similar to how a computer can generate anything that it wants in its virtual reality. It starts as abstract code, evolving into real pixels on your screen instantly. This is consistent with Hindu and Buddhist belief that the world is an illusion.

Again, this is very different from the Roman or Jewish belief that the universe was pre-created, usually in 7 days.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Ah, the real-time creation is the same idea in the movie "The Matrix".
{{< /r >}}

{{< youtube OKpHHMi3yZU >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Yes. It's more commonly known as theories that say that [we exist in a simulation](https://www.wired.com/story/living-in-a-simulation/). Knowing how this simulation is sustained allows the possibility to tap into that inexhaustible creative or sustaining mechanism. **It means existence was not meant to be suffered**. If you are suffering then it's your fault, not of 'God' or Nature. In our case, we use this knowledge to solve all problems.

In the beginning, we used it to solve the personal problems of others. In time, we saw everyone having the same pattern of problems. So we organized everything into Superphysics principles to make problem-solving more efficient. We saw that David Hume, in his Treatise of Human Nature, was already ahead in this regard. So we organized our principles into three (Material, Bio, and Social) to match his three books. This also matches the categorization by Descartes.  
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
There are 3 principal sciences: Medicine, Mechanics, Ethics
{{< /q >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So how can that knowledge solve problems? Are you just going to be like the Hindus and solve the problem by ignoring it as an illusion? Or will you rely on spirits to solve every problem?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
No. Superphysics solves problems by striking at the root cause, which is the 'True Nature' or Dharma or Tao in every thing that leads to its discrete identity, as described by Socrates. 

A problem begins when something goes away from its True Nature, Dharma, or Tao, diverting it from its natural, friction-free flow.

Most sciences just deal with the effect and not the cause because science is ignorant of metaphysics which is the real cause of anything in physics. The education system is supposed to help children discover their True Nature, Dharma, or Tao so that they can direct their lives towards it. But instead, it just molds them to be industrial or intellectual workers (the dharma of industry and business). 

Ask anyone what the goal or purpose of their life is, and they will look at you with a blank stare. So the first step is to find the metaphysical true nature.

## Bigots

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
I'm a racist, materialist boomer. I don't like anything Asian and abstract like Brahma, Yin-Yang, human unity, circular economy blah blah blah. :shit: 

I want profits and wealth for myself. I drink my expensive coffee with plastic straws. I don't care about the turtles that will die from ingesting them. Sucks to be them. Their death is just Nature choosing the strongest and destroying the weak and useless. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
So you prefer the survival of the fittest?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
Of course. And you are nuts to propose a one-state solution that unites Jews and Palestinians. All Muslims are terrorists! 

The universe was created for us humans. After death, there is nothing. There is no evidence of God, the afterlife, reincarnation, or karma. So I say maximize pleasure while alive!

So what if there's global warming? In the long-run, we're all dead! At least I've experienced a 5-star lifestyle. 'Me' 'myself' and 'I' are all that matters. It's the Iron law of Nature, as explained by Hitler:
{{< /r >}}

{{< q a="Adolf Hitler" c="Mein Kampf, Race And People" >}}
The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel. He will feel so merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind.
{{< /q >}}
 <!-- Heaven can be on earth, bought by :musical_notes: money money money in a rich man's world :musical_notes:.  -->

<!--  and don't care about the consequences, even on others! Go ahead and exhaust your brain theorizing wormholes and dark matter that will never exist, or quantitative easing that either bloats the debt and shuts down governments or causes stagflation. -->


{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Ok boomer, so Superphysics isn't for you. We reject selfishness, vice, and the lack of virtue. You should stay in some dogmatic imperialist Roman religion that sees itself superior, or in Modern Physics and Economics that is limited to the 5 senses. 

People who ascribe to Superphysics are open-minded and lovers of philosophy, nature, and the Supreme Entity, as explained by Socrates. These allow the 6th sense of intuition and fellow-feeling, on top of the usual math and 5-sense cognitive abilities in IQ tests.

We are targetting young people because they are the ones stuck with warmed-world destroyed by the previous generation. Notice how we use emojis and the chat format to appeal to young people. The Boomer mentality should die with the Boomer generation and not cross over to Gen Z.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
What makes you so absolutely sure that you know the nature of the universe? What is your qualification? I have a PhD from a top Western university with dozens of peer-reviewed papers published.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We've had low-level samadhi :high_brightness:, after going through the necessary rigors.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
What's samadhi?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
What's samadhi? Ask [Patanjali](/research/indian/yoga/part-1)! All we can say is "No Samadhi, No Honey" :thumbsdown: (i.e. Without samadhi, you won't get a solid understanding of how the universe is structured and generated in real-time). But here's a bonus: Patanjali actually gives hints how to upgrade yourself to 6-senses. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Boomer" >}}
No seriously, what's samadhi?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
We answer [here](/faqs/spiritual). 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Samadhi is like when Neo in *The Matrix* movie realized that he was in a giant computer when his 6th sense saw the code running behind his reality. (I like that movie :innocent:)
{{< /r >}}

<!-- {{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
Instead of revealing the code, we try to reveal the aether in each phenomenon. 
{{< /l >}} -->

{{< r a="Muslim" >}}
What does the Superphysics symbol mean?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
The blue triangle represents the metaphysical domain. The green triangle represents the physical domain. These go in opposite directions. The yellow center is perception which balances both domains. :sunny:

Some people get filthy rich but lose their morals, :frowning: while others are super spiritual but are dirt poor :confused:. For example, Baby-Boomers mindlessly push for GDP or ROI growth even if Nature is hitting them back with global warming caused by that very GDP and ROI. They even have the audacity to make money from crises as 'impact investments' instead of giving money to governments to solve them (such as grants and prize money even for students or startups to make nuclear fusion work).

Spiritual people, on the other hand, give donations and service, often unsustainably while creating a culture of dependence and poverty. Superphysics advocates a balance or a middle path.<!--  just like Buddhism advocates a middle path -->
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's the gameplan of Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}


<!-- We need to prove that our principles are solid by demonstrating it in the real world. 

We've already proven Social Superphysics through our correct predictions both in [politics](/social/cycles/predictions) and [economics](/social/supersociology/precrisis-years). We are already testing our points-based economic system to solve the current stagflation, something that Economics has no solution for. So no worries with those. 

But we still need to prove that Bio Superphysics and Material Superphysics also work by using the aether to  increase crop yield (as 'Maximized Farming'), cure diseases, realize fusion, levitation, and teleportation (actions at a distance) by tapping Descartes' spacetime particles which he calls air-aether but we call Qosts (Quantum of Space-Time). -->



{{< l a="Superphysics" >}}
New philosophies and systems arise in response to problems. To make things simpler, we position Superphysics to solve recurring problems:
- [Material Superphysics](/faqs/material) tackles global warming
- [Social Superphysics](/faqs/social) tackles war (via [Supersociology](/faqs/supersociology)) and shrinkflation (via [Supereconomics](/faqs/supereconomics))
- [Bio Superphysics](/faqs/bio) tackles health problems
- [Spiritual Superphysics](/faqs/spiritual) tackles the problem of people not having a direction in life
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
I guess you encounter a lot of opposition from humans who think that the limited 5-sense science is perfect and superior to 6-sense science which to them is invalid pseudo-science. :sweat:
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Bio Superphysics" >}}
Yes. This is now known as 'scientism' [propagated by materialists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-darkness/201911/scientism). For example, alternative medicines that don't pass clinical trials are not classified as medicine even if they cure 10% of people but not all. Instead of canceling them as inconclusive, Bio Superphysics groups those 10% people into a **specific personality type** which is cured 100% by that alternative medicine. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
Imagine talking to cavemen about the possibility of creating agriculture, radio, antibiotics, and representative-goverments to improve their lives. Yet those very cavemen laugh and call you crazy and force you to cancel research and go back to hunting deer like all other cavemen.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Yeah. Those materialists even refuse to declare that General Relativity is wrong even if the James Webb Space Telescope and DESI are screaming it to their faces. They always say General Relativity has passed tests, **without realizing that all those tests are electromagnetic in nature**, and not of spacetime (except for the Weak Equivalence Principle which is matter-based and Galilean anyway). Jeez. Talk about low standards. No wonder humans are still stuck on Earth. 
{{< /l >}}

<!-- But classifying everything is costly. Machine learning helps a lot, so the AI boom is a Godsend (Rather, by pursuing our dharma for Superphysics, reality bent or shifted towards one that has the tools to do what we do). 

However, the gap between experiment and useful non-software invention is still huge. For example, the principle of action-reaction can be demonstrated with a $0.10 party balloon releasing air to propel itself. But it takes a lot more effort to convert that principle into a working rocket which costs $1,000 and even more to make an Atlas rocket :rocket: worth $100m. -->

<!-- This is why, until 2030, most of our work is on Social Superphysics. The work on Bio and Material Superphysics will mostly be theoretical for now, though we've done [rudimentary experiments on pre-levitation](/material/levitation) and preventing cancers from getting worse via alternative medicine. -->
