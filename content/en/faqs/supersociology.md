What is Supersociology?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
It's the implementation of Superphysics for societies. It's based on:
- Socrates' Law on Social Cycles
- Ibn Khaldun's group feelings
- Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Feelings (Sentiments) which is derived from David Hume
- Descartes' passions of the soul
- Musashi's 5 Rings
- The propensities of the soul according to yoga chakras

Its main idea is that society is a metaphysical organism, as kind of oversoul made up of individual souls.

You mean society eats, poops, and grows? 
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
We mean that society has a lifespan and interacts in certain ways with other society-organisms. As a metaphysical being, it is more energy than matter. It has cycles of behavior with ups and downs, just like energy can get stronger or weaker.

Sometimes it is friendly with other societies, as seen in unions. Sometimes it is beligerent, as seen in wars and revolutions.

How would Social Superphysics solve the Israel-Hamas conflict?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
By writing a new law-book that unifies the Torah and the Quran. The root cause of the conflict is that:
- The Jews program their minds according to the Torah
- The Muslims program their minds according to the Quran, which denounces the Torah 

The great big problem is that **mentality creates reality**. If you absolutely believe in an Apocalypse then Nature will gladly create one for you. The current [Apocalypse](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144492) in Gaza is a real trouble which eats up the attention and resources of the world. This is similar to how the fight between malware and anti-virus on your computer eats up resources that slows down other programs. The world has to push for such a new law-book, as the core of a one-state solution, for its own sake.

{{< r a="Muslim" >}}
How could that new law-book be created?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
Ideally, Palestinians, Jews, and Arabs should get together and write it.

Until then, our workaround is to unify them with the Anunnaki Quran and Old Testament, wherein we replace "God" and "Allah" with Enki. Hopefully, this will unify them by implying that they really are worshipping the same Enki (or faction of Enki) which merely had rivalries with other Anunnaki.

{{< r a="Muslim" >}}
You mean the Zecharaiah Stitchin pseudo-science Anunnaki?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Social Superphysics" >}}
No. We mean the Sumerian, Babylonian, Jewish, Greek, Egyptian, Mayan Anunnaki from the original texts. We then cross reference these with various channeled information from aliens. 

We reject outright any inconsistencies in order to give us a big picture. For example, Stitchin gave wrong intepretations of Nibiru and Tiamat, even writing that early humans had regular sex with animals (in an effort to explain Genesis 3).  
{{< /l >}}

{{< q a="Zechariah Sitchin" c="12th Planet, Chapter 13" >}}
Man had come to recognize that having sex with animals was evil. But why were Adam and Eve punished for giving up sodomy?
{{< /q >}}


 <!-- a shortcut could be to use machine learning like ChatGPT or Bard to combine the Torah and the Quran for the sake of world peace (since both are text-data). It would be a proof of concept of the great uses of AI -- using it to unite people instead of being [a danger to humanity](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-musk-risks.html) -->
