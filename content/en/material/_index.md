description: "Before Newton came along, Physics was based on Descartes which was based on the 5 Elements. Modern Physics only knows 3 of these 5 Elements which they now call Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetism. The nature of the 2 Elements of Space and Aether are unknown and this is why currently there is no levitation or teleportation technologies. <p class='pt-4 text-lg dark:text-gray-200'>We bring back Descartes' Physics to give a true explanation of Nature so that we can get off this burning planet destroyed by the previous generations.</p>"
