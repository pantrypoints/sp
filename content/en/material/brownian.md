People unjustly give praise to Einstein for Relativity and the Photoelectric Effect. But none of them are keen enought to realize that these are sophistries that make Electromagnetism the superior principle instead of the aether.


Einstein's real contribution to science, that does not go against Nature, is the idea of Brownian motion. This explains the idea that matter is made up of molcular and atmoic particles that move against each other. THis leads to the concet of solid, liquid, and gas, something that is taught to every child.
