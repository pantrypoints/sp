In Cartesian Physics, the fundamental forces of the Standard model are called Elements:


Physics Name | Cartesian Equivalent
--- | ---
Strong force | Earth-Aether or 3rd Element
Weak force | Water-Aether
Electromagnetism | Fire-Aether or 1st Element
Spacetime | Air-Aether or 2nd Element
Quantum Fields | Pure Aether


It has a hierarchy, with the pure aether being superior to the air-aether and so on. That is, spacetime can gravitate light, but light cannot gravitate spacetime. 

The mistake of 19th century physics was to think that the pure aether was within the fire-aether. 

Huygens is to blame for that mistake, since Fresnel got his luminiferous aether theory from him. 

In reality, light is inferior to and within the air-aether (spacetime), while spacetime is inferior to and within the pure aether. That is proven by Lorentz transformations which are based on the pure aether which tranforms the air aether (spacetime).

The aether drag now manifests as gravitational waves detected by LIGO which is a more precise Michelson Morley interferometer. 

So Lorentz was on the right track. However, he was hijacked by Einstein who suddenly put the fire aether as superior via c, making the pure aether irrelevant. So Einstein trapped Physics and made the aether out or reach.

Calculus is just the plotting of sequential movement within spacetime. The problem is that the aether is above spacetime and not bound by sequential movement. So calculus won't work. Instead, the inherent biases of each identity is what works. Qualimath then compares those biases to predict movement that seemed random from the spacetime point of view.

So the bias of each identity has to be extracted EACH TIME a qualimath operation is to be done. 

Things within spacetime are predictable and logical. This is why Math can uses ready made objects like the memory of 7 x 9 = 63. 

But Qualimath has to painstakingly derive it each time: 7 + 7 + 7.. = 63 simply because it does not trust that the aether has stayed in its place.

Notice how to whole Egyptian system has to start with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 EACH TIME it makes a computation. That whole process makes sure that it is updated on the qualities of the aether.


Micheslon Morley just needed more precise equipment to detect the aether drag. This is now possible with LIGO which calls the aether drag as gravitational waves. 

Micheslon Morley was to think that the pure aether was WITHIN the fire-aether (light).  So Michelson Morley really showed proof of the high level aether drag as their c being different from Fizeau's c.
