Modern Physics has no concept of virtual space particles and so it is ignorant on the nature of gravity. 

This ignorance is shown in the lack of anti gravity technology and in the mysteries such as the Hubble Tension and the impossible galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope. 

More recently, the ignorance is seen in Physics being unable to explain the dynamics of the Comet 3I Atlas. 


Avi Loeb gave 15 anomalies of 3I Atlas:

1. Retrograde Trajectory: Moves opposite to planet orbits.
2. Fine-Tuned Arrival: Arrived perfectly to pass near Jupiter, Mars, & Venus.
3. Non-Gravitational Acceleration: Required massive mass loss (13%) but didn't break apart.
5. Rotation Axis Alignment: Its axis is aligned with the sunward direction.
2. Ecliptic Alignment: Its orbit is nearly parallel to the ecliptic plane (0.2% chance).
10. Arrival direction aligns with the mysterious "Wow!" signal source.

4. Tightly Collimated Jet: The gas jet is focused like a narrow beam.
6. Stable Jet Direction: Maintains a consistent direction despite rotation.
11. No Dust Coma: Lacks the usual dusty haze of a typical comet.
14. Negative Polarization
15. Unusual Brightness: Fluctuations don't fit standard models; it brightened rapidly.
4. Long Sunward Jet: Ejects material towards the Sun, not away.

11. Gas Composition (Nickel/Cyanide): High nickel/cyanide ratio, unlike other comets.
12. Rocky Massive Low Water Content: Only 4% water by mass (comets usually have dominant water).

13. Color Change: Plume changed from red to green after perihelion (C2 molecule presence).


. Intense Outgassing: Requires huge surface area to explain jet mass (unexplained by natural models). 


<!-- 1. Its retrograde trajectory is 5 degrees with the ecliptic plane of the planets.
	
2. During July, August, and early November, it showed an anti-tail.


3. Its nucleus is a million times more massive than Oumuamua and a thousand times more massive than Borisov, while moving faster than both

4. Its arrival time brings it within 10 of millions of kilometers from Mars, Venus and Jupiter.

<!-- 5. Its gas plume contains much more nickel than iron -->

 <!-- (as found in industrially-produced nickel alloys) and a nickel to cyanide ratio that is orders of magnitude larger than that of all known comets, including 2I/Borisov, with a likelihood below 1% (see here). -->


<!-- 6. Its gas plume contains only 4% water by mass, a primary constituent of familiar comets

7. It shows extreme negative polarization

This is from its 5 degree angle. 


8. It arrived at an angle of 9 degrees

9. Near perihelion, it brightened faster than any known comet and was bluer than the Sun.

This is part of the nickel content

10. It exhibits sunward and anti-solar jets which require an unreasonably large surface area in order to absorb enough sunlight needed to sublimate enough ice to feed the mass flux of these jets (as calculated here).

11. Near perihelion it exhibits non-gravitational acceleration which requires massive evaporation of at least 13% of its mass (as calculated here), whereas preliminary images indicate that the object maintained its integrity and did not break up (as discussed here).

12. Its tightly-collimated jets maintain orientation across a million kilometers in multiple directions relative to the Sun despite its measured rotation.
