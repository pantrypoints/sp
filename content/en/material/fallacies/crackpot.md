We usually post our Superphysics findings on Reddit as a public timestamp or timecapsule for the train of ideas that we get. This is because Reddit has great SEO.

Most people comment that we are crackpots and our posts are pseudoscience even if we link posts to proofs:
- from Buddhism as levitating monks (Buddhism is all about proving things and discarding dogma)
- from Chinese medicine as the healing through chi (Descartes' animal spirits)
- from UFO footage and Bob Lazar's explanation of the Physics of the sport model UFO of the Grays

So we dissect the Crackpot Index that Redditors claim is the basis for such brandings. Basically it gives points for each statement that does not align with the current dogma of the religion of Physics, just as Galileo did not align with Catholic dogma.

<!-- ![Einstein Priest](/photos/physics/priest.jpg) -->

This gives us an understanding of the actual shape of that dogma based on the weights given to each idea. Here, we list the essence of each item in the index to see how dogmatic it is

Index Item | Our Comment 
--- | ---
**1 point** for every statement that is widely agreed on to be false | {{< x v="Dogmatic as 'widely' means mass consensus which is biased towards materiality" >}}
**2 points** for every statement that is clearly vacuous | This is fair
**3 points** for every statement that is logically inconsistent | This is fair 
**5 points** for each such statement that is adhered to despite careful correction | {{< x v="Very dogmatic as it instantly assumes the other party is wrong" >}}
**5 points** for using a thought experiment that contradicts the results of a widely accepted real experiment | This is fair
**5 points** for each word in all capital letters (except for those with defective keyboards) | This is fair
**5 points** for each mention of "Einstien", "Hawkins" or "Feynmann" | {{< x v="This is dogmatic, aiming to keep the holiness of those personalities, similar to the 3rd Commandment in the Bible" >}}
**10 points** for each claim that quantum mechanics is fundamentally misguided (without good evidence) | {{< x v="This is dogmatic as it decrees that Quantum Mechanics principles are already fully understood yet there is even no quantum computers commercially deployed or any other quantum effect harnessed such as the teleportation of ships" >}}
**10 points** for pointing out that you have gone to school, as if this were evidence of sanity | {{< x v="This is absurd as if people who think differently are insane" >}}
**10 points** for beginning the description of your theory by saying how long you have been working on it. (10 more for emphasizing that you worked on your own.) | {{< x v="This is absurd as time often correlates to quality" >}}
**10 points** for mailing your theory to someone you don't know personally and asking them not to tell anyone else about it, for fear that your ideas will be stolen. | This is fair
**10 points** for offering prize money to anyone who proves and/or finds any flaws in your theory. | {{< x v="This is commonly done in software as bug bounty so it is absurd to denigrate it" >}}
**10 points** for each new term you invent and use without properly defining it. | This is fair
**10 points** for each statement along the lines of "I'm not good at math, but my theory is conceptually right, so all I need is for someone to express it in terms of equations" | {{< x v="This is absurd as there are other sciences where equations are not critical" >}}
**10 points** for arguing that a current well-established theory is "only a theory", as if this were somehow a point against it | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it sets the status quo as correct, preventing a change for the better" >}} 
**10 points** for arguing that while a current well-established theory predicts phenomena correctly, it doesn't explain "why" they occur, or fails to provide a "mechanism" | {{< x v="Totally dogmatic because it enshrines ignorance" >}}
**10 points** for each favorable comparison of yourself to Einstein, or claim that special or general relativity are fundamentally misguided (without good evidence) | {{< x v="The evidence from James Webb, DESI, Plack Satellites are evidence against Relativity IF a person interprets them in that way. So this item is Einstein-dogmatic because Physics won't accept the evidence" >}}
**10 points** for claiming that your work is on the cutting edge of a "paradigm shift" | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it sees change as a bad thing" >}}
**20 points** for emailing me and complaining about the crackpot index. (E.g., saying that it "suppresses original thinkers" or saying that I misspelled "Einstein" in item 8.) | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it protects the status quo" >}}
**20 points** for suggesting that you deserve a Nobel prize | This is fair as real researchers research for research e.g. George Perelman who declined the million dollar prize money"
**20 points** for each favorable comparison of yourself to Newton or claim that classical mechanics is fundamentally misguided (without good evidence) | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it protects the status quo" >}}
20 points for every use of science fiction works or myths as if they were fact | This is fair, but absurd for futurist theories which can only have basis on fiction
20 points for defending yourself by bringing up (real or imagined) ridicule accorded to your past theories | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it tries to discourage change" >}}
20 points for naming something after yourself. (E.g., talking about the "The Evans Field Equation" when your name happens to be Evans.) | This is fair. Using people's names for things in nature such as fermions, Higgs, bosons are an insult to Nature. Imagine Trump renaming the sun as Trump-star to make his memory last a really long time
20 points for talking about how great your theory is, but never actually explaining it | This is fair
20 points for each use of the phrase "hidebound reactionary". | This is fair but irrelevant
20 points for each use of the phrase "self-appointed defender of the orthodoxy". | This is fair but irrelevant
**30 points** for suggesting that a famous figure secretly disbelieved in a theory which he supported. (E.g., Feynman was an  opponent of relativity) | {{< x v="Dogmatic as it preserves the status quo" >}}
**30 points** for suggesting that Einstein, in his later years, was groping his way towards the ideas you now advocate. | This is fair but totally irrelevant
**30 points** for claiming that your theories were developed by an extraterrestrial civilization (without good evidence) | {{< x v="This is unfair since ET's cannot be mandated to give evidence" >}}
**30 points** for allusions to a delay in your work while you spent time in an asylum, or references to the psychiatrist who tried to talk you out of your theory | This is fair
**40 points** for comparing those who argue against your ideas to Nazis, stormtroopers, or brownshirts | {{< x v="Absurd since they might actually be Nazis and the theorist might really be Jewish or Communist" >}}
**40 points** for claiming that the "scientific establishment" is engaged in a "conspiracy" to prevent your work from gaining its well-deserved fame | This is fair
**40 points** for comparing yourself to Galileo, suggesting that a modern-day Inquisition is hard at work on your case, and so on | {{< x v="Absurd and Dogmatic as the Church was against change just as this Index is" >}}
**40 points** for claiming that when your theory is finally appreciated, present-day science will be seen for the sham it truly is. (30 more points for fantasizing about show trials in which scientists who mocked your theories will be forced to recant.) | {{< x v="This is dogmatic as it assumes Physics is totally correct" >}}
**50 points** for claiming you have a revolutionary theory but giving no concrete testable predictions | This is fair.

### Resistance to Change: An Index Protecting How Stuck Physics Is

The weights of the index prove that its essence is to **preserve the status quo of Physics**.

In the past, we thought that the cause was the fear that physicists had of losing employment since a new Physics would render them irrelevant. But we have talked to retired ones who were still protecting the religion of Physics.

So we pinned it down to **resistance to change**, something that is common in the human species. 

In our case, talking to old physicists made us realize how slow or limited their thinking process and scope was. As if they had no more mental energy nor excitement to go through new ideas. 

This is consistent with the resistance to adopting new systems like Buddhism or Taoism, Chinese Medicine or Ayurveda, and alien politics involving Grays, Anunnaki, Essassani, etc.

The big problem is that global warming, food insecurity, nuclear radation (from Fukushima and a possible nuclear war), and the lack of nuclear fusion are all glaring signs that Physics has failed to deliver. This is different from Computer and Data Science which has brought the internet, mobile devices, and awesome AI. 

Change is inevitable and humans don't want to stay stuck on the Earth forever.

The current religion of Science and its limitations from matter are sure to be replaced by something more subtle, advanced, and integrative. 

The real question is when will that replacement happen? 

It took over 40 years for Newton's Physics to replace Descartes. 

So we assume that it will also take that around that time for people to actually read up on Cartesian Science (which unites Classical Physics with Quantum Mechanics and Medicine, at least).

Only a severe event such as a nuclear war or an asteroid impact would rush the adoption of a new Physics and the discarding of the current scam-based one that has Einstein as its Jesus.

{{< i s="/photos/objects/asteroid.jpg" a="Asteroid" c="We actually need an asteroid to threaten life on Earth to expose how useless the Physics of Newton and Einstein are, and how only the true Physics of Descartes, Spinoza, Hindusim, Buddhism, and Taoism can deal with it through an anti-gravity 'net' as explained in the Sumerian texts of how the Anunnaki weaponized asteroids via anti-gravity technology to wipe out planetary life" >}}

Only then will humans free their minds from being told that nothing travels faster than light. When they get rid of this limiting imposition then the reality of the teleportation of masses will be more realizable.
