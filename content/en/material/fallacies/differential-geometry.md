The corruption of Physics began when Einstein created Relativity which was based on the sophistical idea of the Simultaneity of Time which assigned the properties of the Spatial Layer onto the Radiant Layer or Electromagnetism.


{{< q a="Einstein" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous [happen at the same time]. You object by saying that "time" would only be "simultaneity" if light travels at a constant speed, but the speed of light is measured by time. You would say this is reasoning in a circle and therefore, simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light. I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.

This converted Descartes' virtual space particles into a material fabric of spacetime in General Relativity, which is patterned after electromagnetic fluxes instead of liquid vortices.

The dynamics of electromagnetic fluxes and fields led to the development of differential geometry which is the heart of gauge theories. 

Relativity therefore allowed differential geometry to break out into Physics like a pandemic, through mathematical ideas like symmetry and manifolds.  

This is very different from the Cartesian system of Bernoulli that used pressure differences as high and low pressure, without the need to specify any topological geometry. 
- The differential geometry is just the effect of the liquid dynamics of the perpetual flow of the aether.

Relativity disconnects Physics from reality by confounding the spatial and radiant layers. 
- This allows anyone to make their own gauge theories as 'make your own spacetimes' just as anyone can create mathematical variables and transpose and operate on them arbitrarily. 
- This is why all spatial theories based on Relativity such as loop quantum gravity and string theory have failed in reality.  



## Hydrology and 2-Dimensional Euclidean Geometry Shows the Way

It is absurd to make an internal 3D geometry of the oceans which are always changing. 

Instead, hydrologists use 2D models of currents and temperature distribution. This makes it easy to plot high and low pressure, and channel flow.


<!--  differential geometry has dominated Physics.
- This is made up of arbitrary 3-dimensional shapes and "manifolds", such as that of Gauss and Riemann . 

But this arbitrariness goes against the simplicity of Nature. Even Euclid's Elements is about 2-dimensional shapes instead of 3D ones. And so you have weird maths to describe infinite imaginative variations of spacetime.  -->

This is why Material Superphysics also uses sequential 2D slices to describe "Riemann Manifolds". 

Instead of theorizing the entire spacetime (which is impractical anyway), the better process would be:

1. Find out what you are trying to achieve with the real phenomena in the first place
2. Get data from the real phenomena 
3. Plot the relations of the data in slices in the order of the sequence that they are preceived
4. Get the overall picture from those slices in aggregate 

This would greatly simplify or minify the maths needed to plot the phenomenon in spacetime. 

This replaced differential geometry with Euclidean geometry and data science. 

Riemann geometry is merely a mix of the properties of Euclidean geometry focusing on effects instead of causes. 

<!-- We use Euclidean geometry to theoretically plot the ratios needed by Buddhist monks levitate, or by UFOs zip in zigzag faster than sound without using any sophistical manifold. The ratios must be correct otherwise the levitating monk or vehicle will hit a wall (i.e. go to the wrong Euclidean spacetime coordinates).  

Surveyors use triangles to map fixed surfaces. Gauss used metric tensor (triangle) to map curved, transforming surfaces. These triangles are effects, not causes. 

Einstein hacked this by using c as the rigid measuring rod for spacetime, using Electromagnetism as the supreme Element out of the 5 Elements (Aether, Spacetime, EM, Weak, Strong).

This gives reality to spacetime, very different from all the ancient philosophers and pre-Einstein scientists who said spacetime is an illusion and not real. 

So one guy named Einstein goes against every man of science from ancient times and east and west. 

Spacetime fabric is very useful for things that are seen (electromagnetic). But it is junk for things unseen (spacetime) like dark matter and dark energy. 

So tests of GR always work for seen things. This is like asking Trump supporters to rate Trump. They will always give him perfect scores. 

The consequence is spacetime and the aether are discarded and spacetime/aether tech are nowhere. 

Had Einstein never existed nuclear fusion would have been viable by the 1970s in time for the Oil Crisis and humans would be in Mars by now in levitating ships instead of Newtonian rockets that go boom and kill its occupants. 

Time dilation and length contraction exist and are caused by the aether via spacetime. Lorentz-Poincare Relativity is the real deal, non-scam. They just needed to get rid of Huygens-Fresnel aether and use the original Cartesian aether (the stuff that causes spacetime to divide constantly and cause the expansion of the universe).  

We test this by making things lighter using the aether without electromagnetism, the same technique that monks and UFOs use to levitate. This is easier done with living things like plants where the aether makes them grow faster.
