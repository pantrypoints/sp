The damage that Einstein has done to humanity may be ranked as follows:

Rank | Damage | Reason
--- | --- | ---
1 | Misdirection of Physics and Science | The Simultaneity of Time fools people into wasting time creating instant-fail theories like String Theory, Supersymmetry, Loop Quantum Gravity, etc.
2 | Lack of Discovery of the Aether and Spacetime | This is a consequence of Simultaneity
3 | Lack of Anti Gravity Technology | This is a consequence of lack of aetherspace (Gravity A waves to Bob Lazar)
4 | Lack of Nuclear Fusion | This is a consequence of lack of aetherspace
5 | Lack of Teleportation Technology | This is a consequence of the lack of aetherspace
6 | Lack of Cheap Antimatter | This is a consequence of lack of the aether
7 | Lack of Optical Computing  | This is a consequence of the lack of the aether
8 | Nukes | Use Physics to destroy your enemies before they destroy you

## The Einstein Scam

The whole Einstein scam began in 1905 when he pushed the simultaneity of time. This crudified time, a mental effect, into a light-effect, measured by c. 

{{< youtube P_T-D6dwGFU >}}



The great big problem is that light is just the middle Element of reality and not the causal or highest one which is the aether.

We define the aether as the substance of ideas and feelings, and the abstract mind or soul that has those ideas and feelings. This is in line with quantum mechanics which is based on collapse from observation.  

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/layers.png" a="5 Elements" >}}


From the 5 Elements model, there are 3 kinds of time:

1. Mental time

This is true time, based on the Aether or 5th Element

2. Light time

This is light-years and light-speed used to measure very large distances. It is also the basis of relativistic time. This is the Fire Element. 

3. Material time

This is absolute time in Classical Mechanics. This is the Matter or Earth Element. 


**By pegging time to light, the 2 Elements of spacetime and aether are lost forever.** This leads to the lack of anti-gravity and teleportation technology.

Anti-gravity is needed by sustained nuclear fusion as is done in stars. The gravity, as a vortex, compreses the particles to make them emit light by agitation. 

<!-- Stars **do not** produce fusion by confining their centers in a magnetic field. Instead, those centers are compressed only by gravity.  -->

This is why fusion is always 30 years away under a Physics that is based on Einstein.

> By pegging time to light, the 2 Elements of spacetime and aether are lost forever


The worst damage is the sheer amount of human brainpower wasted trying to build useful theories on top of Relativity.


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/einstein.jpg" a="Einstein" >}}

String theory, supersymmentry, loop quantum gravity, smashing atoms to look for axions and wimps, these have drained effort and resources for nothing. 

It's better to have done nothing for 100 years rather than work so hard and waste resources just to achieve the same nothing.

> It’s better to have done nothing for 100 years rather than work so hard to achieve the same nothing.


## Kant (and Mathematics) is to Blame

But the fallacy of Einstein is really just a follower of Kant, who is the real factory of fallacy. 

The whole crime of Kant is to detach reality from the thinking process. This means that I can think of *imaginary* spacetimes and decree that to be *real* spacetime. 

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Reply to Criticisms" >}}
I did not grow up in the Kantian tradition, but I found what is truly valuable in Kant's doctrine: "The real is not given to us, but put to us (by way of a riddle)." It means that we have a conceptual construction whose authority is purely in its validation. This conceptual construction refers precisely to the “real” (by definition). **Every further question on the “nature of the real” appears empty.**
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Kant" >}}
A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented a priori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their quality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the homogeneous), by means of number.
{{< /q >}}


This is how simultanteity leads to imaginary spacetimes like Taub Nut, Godel, Desitter, etc created by mathematicians. 

This is because mathematics is purely within-the-mind or *a priori*. It can exist without any reality. This is why Kant enshrines math as the top science.

<!-- The whole cause of the error is the Kant-style mentality from the 19th century. This manifests as the dominance of mathematics in science.  -->



{{< q a="Kant" >}}
Pure reason succeeds in the sphere of mathematics. It leads to the expectation that the mathematical method can be applied to other regions of mental endeavour. In this way, it can make itself a master over nature.

In other words, the Creationist priests of the 18th century merely mutated into the Big-Bang mathematicians of the 20th century after being ejected by the French Revolution i.e. the French Revolution made the priests mutate into materialist scientists after making religious employment unfashionable. 

This is proven by the priest-physicist Lemaitre. The bad lot of intellectuals that would have become priests, opted instead to study science and impose materialist dogmas that other humans must follow.

The Church of Religion and the supremacy of God was merely replaced by the Church of Science and the supremacy of the limited 5 senses.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/ccc.jpg" a="CCC" c="Penrose, who advanced the CCC Theory, is like a priest describing how God created the universe. Both priest and mathematician are slaves to their imaginations. The priest is a slave to the rules in the Bible. The mathematician is a slave to the rules of constants. Both do hacks to make their propositions seem realistic or believable" >}}

> The Church of Religion was merely replaced by the Church of Science


{{< q a="Einstein" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous [happen at the same time]. You object by saying that "time" would only be "simultaneity" if light travels at a constant speed, but the speed of light is measured by time. You would say this is reasoning in a circle and therefore, simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light. I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.

This dominance of math and materialism is a sign of the Negative Force which then is a necessary effect of the lack of spirituality or the Positive Force*.

{{< n n="This modern pattern actually helped us define spirituality as being based on the Positive Force, instead of on the aether, substance, or consciousness i.e. there is nothing spiritual about being awake versus being asleep" >}}

This evil manifests as: 

- Einstein making a simultaneity principle that is based only on his need to publish papers, instead of being in line with Nature
- Investment bankers who say that "Too big to fail" will not do any harm
- Politicians who say that wild democracy in Iraq and the Middle East will bring peace and progress instead of chaos
- Crypto startups who say that crypto is a solution instead of a new problem 

These are just assertions based on biased beliefs. 

**The successful tests of Relativity are merely measurements of how Nature already is**, such as time dilation. 

**It does not reveal and hidden properties that can be used to create new technology**. This is because Einstein never explained why light has the speed of `c`, because he didn't know why. 

Cartesian Physics explains that the speed of light is from the constriction of the aether onto spacetime. This leads to our concept of spacetime slices which replace the scam metric tensor and can be the basis for new technologies.  

> Einstein never explained *why* light has the speed of c


## Mathematics and Logic are Just Tools

Mathematics and Logic are just tools used by the mind to connect its nature with that of physical nature. 

- A tax evader can use math as creative accounting in order to cheat on taxes
- A real estate developer can use logic that destroying a forest creates employment and is therefore good
- A mathematician can create useless string theories to show that mathematicss lets us understand Nature, even if it just really measures effects
- An Islamist can use the Quran to justify his logic of killing innocent people

The aim of these is to push the desires of the ego onto physical reality. 

- A tax evader and real estate developer really want to make money at the expense of the government the environment
- A mathematician really is addicted to his own imagination 
- An Islamist is really angry at the injustice he faces


## Qualimath Ratios

These all point to feelings. The feelings of Kant and Einstein, as well as tax evaders, developers, and theorists, are all based on their ego which have grown unchecked. 

The discipline of the ego, and the correct use of math and logic, is done through moral and spiritual philosophy, as the way to combat the Negative Force with the Positive, since the Ego is a product of the Negative.

This ego is seen as the equals sign in mathematics which forces one side to perfectly match the other, as an imposition of the objectivity of the universe. 

But the aether proves that the universe is subjective and that objectivity only reveals the current signature or wavelength of the observer or particle. 

The subjective universe is made up of dynamic relations or ratios which is embodied in our Qualimath which is based on ratios. 

It sees the universe as an infinite multidimensional chain of ratios or relations. By knowing this chain, you can better figure out how to get to the outcome that you want instead of forcing Nature to bend to your will by physical energy or force. 



<!-- In recent history, we can sum up the 3 worst humans:

1. JS Mill - the ideological creator of modern capitalism  
2. Marx - the founder of Communism as a counterweight to Mill's capitalism 
3. Hitler - the fouunder of Nazism which fought both finance-capitalists as Jews and Marxists

These 3 are all carriers of the Negative Force, which we can see as a virus that infests the minds of people without them knowing that they are infested.  

4. Kant - This brought back ego-based thinking, detached from reality, as a philosophy in the Critique of Pure Reason
5. Einstein - fully implements Kant's detached reality by pushing the simultaneity of time which is math-based and not real
