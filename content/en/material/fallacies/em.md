In 1644, Descartes explained that magnetism happens when a material body creates straight channels within itself. This allows virtual photons, which he called striated particles, to pass through.

These virtual photons are corkscrews that enter and exit matter, creating entrance and exit points that Physics call north and south poles. 

It is impossible to have an entrance without an exit and vice versa. This is why cutting a magnet in half creates a new north and south pole.

The direction of the flow then dictates the attraction or repulsion force. 

The same poles of a magnet repel just as 2 people leaving 2 fire exits will clash with each other. But if one exit was changed into an entrance then people will flow seamlessly from exit to entrance.  

An easier analogy is that a virtual photon is a male corkscrew, while matter is female that the screw goes through.  

Opposite poles attract and fit just like the male part of a lego block fits perfectly with the female part of another block. 

A magnetic moment in a 'fermion' is therefore a channel for such screws.


## Cartesian Eletromagnetism

We extend this to explain electromagnetic flux as the flowing electrons creating a channel for virtual photons. 

This creates the same magnetic forces as in iron magnets with the difference that the force can be adjusted by increasing the volume (quantity) or spin (quality) of the channels.

- increasing the volumne of electrons increases the amps 
- increasing the spin of electrons increases the volts 

Both of these increase the flow of virtual photons which are everywhere, which then increases the magnetic force. 


## Relativity Scam

Before Einstein existed, Physics explained electromagnetic force in a wire as flux and the Lorentz Force. But the causal mechanism was still unknown.  

So when Relativity came along, physicists used length contraction to explain electromagnetism. 

They say that electricity makes the positive charge contract and outnumber the negative charge to create magnetism. 

But this is debunked by the fact that the speed of electricity is very slow. 

Physicists try to save the theory by saying that only a tiny amount of length contraction is needed. 

But in Cartesian paradigm, electromagnetism is created by electricity creating straight channels in the wire. This allows virtual photons to pass through and create the usual magnetic field. 

This principle is most obvious in superconductors wherein straight channels are created by removing the heat that usually agitates and de-aligns particles (freezing does not create relativistic length contraction).

Since straight channels, and not length contraction, is the key to magnetism, then cheaper superconductors can be created by aligning particles through the aether instead of through the lack of heat.

It is really the recent idea of virtual particles, as an consequence of quantum mechanics, that explained the cause of electromagnetism.
- Descartes called this virtual particle as striated 1st Element matter.

Eintein had no concept of virtual particles. Instead, he uses a material fabric for the gravitational field. 

The fallacy of Relativity has actually set back the development of technology by 100 years by confounding the common sense of humans. 

The book "100 Authors Against Einstein" is proof that not all humans were conned, and that there is hope to get rid of Relativity for the sake of true advancement and so that quantum mechanics can reign supreme.
