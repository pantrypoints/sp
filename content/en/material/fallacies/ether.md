The defenders of Einstein say that his theory of Relativity allows an ether. 

But they fail to realize that his ether is as nonsense and as useless as the absolute space and time of Newton.


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Ether and General Relativity" >}}
The ether hypothesis is useful in harmonizing the fundamental facts of mechanics.

In order to look at the rotation of the body as something real, Newton objectivises space. He classes his absolute space together with real things. For him, rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real. 

Newton could have called his absolute space as "Ether".
{{< /q >}}


### The Einstein Ether is Unimportant. The Cartesian Aether is Totally Absolutely Important 

The mere fact that Einstein treats the ether as a hypothesis instead of a Law is proof that it plays no critical part in his Physics. 

In contrast, the Physics of Descartes and Spinoza has the aether as a fundamental mechanism. In fact, Spinoza's entire system is based on the properties of the aether which he calls substance.

{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics, Part 1, Prop 11" >}}
God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists
{{< /q >}}


We define aether as the substance of abstract mind and of the ideas and feelings that goes into that mind.
- Substance is therefore the medium or objectification of the aether. 
- It is called *citta* or mind-stuff in Hinduism and Buddhism. The citta that you have to create your thoughts is the same citta that the Brahma (totality of substance) uses to create the physical universe.
- Substance is interchangeable with the aether, as done by Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, and Spinoza. 

<!-- Aether is the theoretical part. Substance or essence is the actual part.  -->


The aether is not material nor physical. This makes it difficult to be perceived by minds that have been conditioned to detect only shallow material perceptions and not trained to detect subtle athereal ones. 


This lack of aether-training in the Western educational system and culture causes physicists to base their theories on visible things.
- Newton chose to base his Physics on matter (3rd Element in Cartesian Physics)
- Einstein chose to base his Physics on observable electromagnetism


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Ether and General Relativity" >}}
Besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real in order to enable acceleration or rotation to be looked upon as something real.

Mach tried to avoid assigning reality to a non-observable thing. Instead of an acceleration with reference to absolute space, he used all of the masses in the universe as reference.. Mach’s idea finds its full development in the ether of General Relativity
{{< /q >}}


So Einstein's abstract mind chose observable Electromagnetism, which is 1st Element to Descartes, as the supreme Element. The major flaw is that Electromagnetism is really just the middle Element and not the top or causal one. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/domains.svg" c="The aether is the top Element that wraps around and behind reality. It is the backstage of the easily-perceptible physical stage." >}}


It is the aether that is the big boss of reality. This is why aethereal mentality creates material reality. 

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 2, Section 2" >}}
It is an established maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence.
{{< /q  >}}


By making electromagnetism supreme, Einstein nececssarily discards the 2 other superior Elements as Spacetime and the Aether. 

This then creates our current universe where there is no levitation or teleportation technology. 
- The levitation of plasma inside the reactor is essential to make nuclear fusion work. 
- This is why nuclear fusion is always 30 years away to anyone who chooses to believe in Einstein's Physics.  

The problem is that everyone thought Einstein was a genius and therefore adopted his mentality. And so everyone gets a reality where there is no levitation and therefore no nuclear fusion which could have prevented wildfires and typhoons by reducing CO2 emissions. 

{{< i s="/photos/countries/us/fires.jpg" a="fires" c="California residents should blame Einstein for making nuclear fusion impossible. This would have reduced CO2 emissions, make the planet cooler, and prevent the destruction of their homes" >}}


### The Einstein Ether Cannot Do Anything. The Cartesian Aether Can Do Everything

Einstein's ether, just like Newton's absolute space, cannot be harnessed to create new technologies. Instead, it is just used to measure phenomena. 

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Ether and General Relativity" >}}
But this ether is very different from that of the ether of the mechanical wave-theory of light. 

The ether of General Relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities. But it helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events.
{{< /q >}}

The Cartesian aether on the other hand is the foundation of reality and so it can be used to make effects in reality. The aether that makes up our abstract minds already lets us walk, talk, eat, laugh, etc. 
- In contrast, a rock which is mostly matter and little aether cannot do the same things.


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/ether.jpg" a="Descartes vs Einstein" c="The Cartesian aether on the left is behind reality, making it all-powerful. Einstein's ether on the right, is just a reference for matter-ial things inside the universe, since matter or mass is the causal principle in materialist physics. Einstein then converts this into electromagnetism via E=mc^2" >}}


When human minds have strong aethereal desire to observe the universe, they mobilize their bodies to create innovations such as:
- the James Webb Space Telescope
- the Dark Energy Survey in Chile

These expand the circumference of the known universe, proving that the edge of the unvierse depends on the aethereal mind. This debunks the assertions of both Newton and Einstein that the universe has a fixed size or shape. 

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Ether and General Relativity" >}}
According to General Relativity, space has physical qualities represented by the ether. But this ether is not a ponderable media which has parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it. 

In this case, the universe must of necessity be spatially unbounded and of finite magnitude. Its magnitude is determined by the value of that mean density.

<!-- Space is not physically empty.

This is because:  
- space and time have reciprocal relations
- "empty space" in its physical relation is neither homogeneous nor isotropic, compelling us to describe its state by 10 functions (the gravitation potentials `gμν`)

This makes the ether useful.  -->
