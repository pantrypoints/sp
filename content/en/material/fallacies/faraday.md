19th century Physics was stumped by the fact that a wire produced electricity when it was moved across a magnet, but did not produce electricity when it was at rest

This led to Faraday's Law of Induction. His idea was that the movement caused a magnetic flux, which in Cartesian Physics is a magentic vortex

This flux then caused an electromotive force (EMF) which then created the electricity


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/induction.jpg" a="Faraday's Paradox" >}}

The flaw with Faraday was that he did not know that magnetism is caused by virtual photons going through straight channels

The concept of channels is from Descartes in the 1630s; virtual photons are from Feynman in the 1940s via QED

Cartesian Physics explains that:
- when a wire is at rest in a magnetic field, its electrons are not compressed and so there is no channel to create electromagnetism
- when the wire is moved, the electrons experience a shift in the virtual photons. This nudges them together to create a channel

This is why the speed and angle of the wire relative to the magnet are important.

Faraday's ignorance of virtual photons and channels led to Faraday's Paradox, which is easily resolved by Cartesian channels

You would think that Maxwell would fix it by adding the concept of either [vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vortex) or channels, something that is now standard in superconductors. 

Instead, Maxwell merely adds divergence and curl to the flux. His ignorance allows the scammer Einstein to offer a false explanation as Special Relativity.  


## The Relativity Scam

Instead of simply combining moving electrons + virtual photons, this Relativity scam unites matter + electromagnetism. It mandates that everything is moving and mass-energy has equivalence

This hilarious theory says that electromagnetism is created by the length contraction of the electrons relative to the wire even if the electrons move very slowly

The knowledge of channels not only solves Faraday's Paradox and makes Relativity unnecessary. It is also essential in deriving free energy from space since channels are needed to harness those virtual photons that are everywhere. 

Virtual photons are like money floating everywhere. But they can only be grabbed by a special claw.

We know this not only because it is allowed by Cartesian Physics, but because advanced alien races, such as the Essassani already use free energy. 

By pushing for Cartesian Physics, we prove our eligibility to enter the human race into the advanced species club and leave the backward loser species club where the members either destroy themselves or wait to be destroyed (such as the dinosaurs).

This is why we have higher regard for dinosaurs because they lasted for millions of years unlike humans which seem to doom themselves either through a quick nuclear war or a slow global warming.
