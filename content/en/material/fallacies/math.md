### Physics is Rigged Towards the Shallowly Observable

Einstein supporters say that Relativity is true because it has been proven by measurements. But they fail to realize that **all those measurements are based on light**, and so of course it will be correct when using light as a ruler.

This is similar to a beauty pageant wherein the basis of beauty is white skin. So of course, the winners will always be white. The organizer would then claim it as proof that Westerners or white skinned people are the most beautiful. 

The fallacy is exposed when the basis for beauty is changed to whatever the world wants. It will reveal that Latinas are the most beautiful since they have won the most awards in non-rigged, international beauty contests. 

Similarly, a true test for Relativity is to use 3 clocks to measure a jet going around the world:

1. An atomic clock -- this is electromagnetic time
2. A sand clock -- this is Classical time
3. A mental clock -- this is mental time

The results will reveal all 3 clocks showing differences. This will then validate Cartesian Physics wherein the 3 clocks represent 3 Elements:

1. Atomic clock is the 1st Element
2. Sand clock is the 3rd Element
3. Mental clock is the 5th Element, as the immaterial aether


### Electromagnetism is NOT the Superior Element: The Simultaneity of Time Fallacy

Einstein's crime is to put electromagnetism, as light, as the supreme element that judges time. When in fact, time is ultimately mental. 

This is why:
- all the major Physics theories that are based on Einstein's Relativity have failed or are useless. Examples are String Theory, Supersymmetry, and Loop Quantum Gravity
- Relativity-based measurements are known to NOT match non-Relativity-based measurements. This was proven by the Hubble Tension and the disgreement between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics on the energy of empty space

This is because Relativity is a false theory built on phantoms created by mathematician's mind via the 'simultaneity of time'

Assume that the equation for the universe is `1 + 1 = 2`. We are in the 19th century and just discovered the speed of light, a real constant

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/corruption.jpg" a="Corruption of Physics" >}}


So we put that in as 'c' and replace a valid equation with `1 + 1 = c/k`

Here, `k` is half the speed of light, a man-made constant invented just to make things fit. Then we claim that our understanding of Nature is more complete

Experiments then try to find `k` in Nature but cannot. But still, `c/k` is very precise because it uses division, leading to the same 2 by dividing itself

Likewise, Relativity is precise because it measures time by itself through `c`, just as `c/k` is precisely 2 even if `k` does not exist.

So `k` is a chimera, an imaginary entity.

Relativity's chimera is the synchronization of 2 clocks based on their speed. The big hole is that Einstein does NOT explain the mechanism behind speed and why photons have a speed of 300,000 km/s. 

> Einstein does not explain why photons have a speed of 300,000 km/s

In constrast, Descartes explains that:
- it is the 2nd Element (invisible space particles) that is limiting the speed of light
- light (as the 1st Element) would be instantaneous if there were no space particles (i.e. only aether)


Einstein actually admits his circular reasoning in his book Relativity, Section 8: 

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity" >}}
'You object by saying that time would only be simultaneity if light travels at a constant speed, and the speed of light is measured by time, but that this is reasoning in a circle. I answer that this is only used to make empirical decisions.'
{{< /q >}}


A true theory should explain that mechanism just as Newton explained gravity's mechanism as the amount of tangible matter in a body.

In this way, all theories built on it would merely tap that mechanism to be useful. 

For example, UFOs already tap Descartes' space particles as Gravity-A Waves to let them levitate and teleport.

Whereas, the only technology from Relativity is GPS. And even if Einstein never existed, engineers would notice the time discrepancy in GPS and create a "Time-Difference Theory" to explain it.

And so Relativity has zero technology and zero use, other than to measure things just like how Ptolemy measured planetary movement accurately with concentric spheres.
