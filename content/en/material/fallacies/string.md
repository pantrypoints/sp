In the 19th century, the speed of light was discovered to be constant and the same regardless of who looked at it. 

When applied to space, this meant that space was flexible and not fixed. 
- This led to the idea of length contraction wherein bodies changed their length depending on their speed.

It assumes that the line joining 2 points of a solid body does not conserve its length

### The Simultaneity of Time Fallacy

The big problem began in 1905 when Einstein applied the same constant speed of light to time, as the idea of "simultaneity of time".

Practically, this prevented teleportation and only allowed time-travel upon reaching very fast speeds.  

Theoreticaly, this led to problems with particle physics when the possible interactions between particles were analyzed through Feynman loops. 
- These loops applied the simultaneity of time to particles and naturally came up with impossible infinities.  

To solve these infinities, **Supersymmetry Theory** was created. 
- This theorized partner particles for each of the known ones, making the infinite finite. 
- However, such partner particles have never been found.

Another theoretical problem created by the simultaneity of time was that gravity did not match quantum mechanics. 

This is because simultaneity uses light to judge space, when in reality, it is the immaterial space (as an agent of the aether) that judges material light.

To solve this, **String Theory** was invented.
- This absurdly converts particles into dimensions which are glued together by an even more absurd 'M-Theory'.

### The Strong Force as Precursor to Dimensional Strings

String theory began when particles were being collided in colliders for the first time. This led to the idea for a gluon flux tube, which is the aetherspace in Material Superphysics. 

Instead of gluons or the aetherspace, Gabriele Veneziano came up with strings as the Veneziano Amplitude. These strings led to the concept of gravitons or quantum gravity as a spin 2 particle.

In other words:
- Supersymmetry converts imaginary objects into 'partner particles'
- String Theory turns particles into imaginary objects

So both of them are just 2 sides of the same fallacy coin.
- Both of them will fail in reality because an imaginary object can never have a reality no matter what you do.

> Both String Theory and Supersymmetry are just 2 sides of the same fallacy coin.

The creator of the imaginary object is the simultaneity of time. 
- This is because, in Cartesian Physics, the true cause of simultaneity is the 5th Element called the aether.
- But Einstein's simultaneity is based on light (1st Element) and so does not match Nature or reality


### The Cause of the Problem: Not Knowing Why C is C


String theory and Supersymmetry are a waste of time because Relativity is false.
- Relativity is false because time is mental, not electromagnetic.

All tests of Relativity are merely electromagnetic measurements **of how things already are**.

For example, measuring the sun to rise in the east very accurately does not explain *why* the sun rises to the east. 
- And so Aristotle and Ptolemy theorized false concentric spheres to account for why the sun rises in the east.

Similarly, humans created false string theory to account for why light is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second.

Therefore, both Einstein and Ptolemy are fallacies peddled as truth, covering up the real ignorance of how Nature works.


### The Solution: Time is Mental and Subjective

The solution is to get rid of Einstein's Relativity which carries the false idea of the simultaneity of time. 

Instead of being light-based, time can be split into 3 kinds:

1. Mental Time

This is timespace based on the Aether layer (5th Element to Cartesian Physics)

2. Electromagnetic Time

This is timespace based on the Radiant layer (1st Element to Cartesian Physics). This is known as relativistic time in Einstein's Physics.

3. Material Time

This is timespace based on the Material layer (3rd Element to Cartesian Physics). This is known as absolute time in  Classical mechanics 

{{< i s="/photos/objects/clock.jpg" a="String Theory and Supersymmetry are wrong" >}}

In this way:
- the infinities of particles are removed by sourcing the energy of particles from the external spacetime. 
- the mismatch between gravity (spatial layer) and quantum mechanics (aethereal layer) is corrected by making the aether the mechanism behind spacetime 


In Cartesian Physics, the simultaneity of time becomes a mere **convention** instead of a principle. It can be used when an engineer needs to measure *passive* time very accurately, such as:
- in GPS or
- in experiments comparing twins, one in a space station and another on Earth. 

This is similar to using chopsticks when eating at a Chinese restarurant.
- There is no rule that a diner must use chopsticks. It is only done if a diner wants to perfectly match the utensil to the dining experience. 

Likewise, the simultaneity of time is only used for such passive time measurements.

Active, arbitrary, and imprecise time measurements will be allowed again. 
- This will free up space and time from the shackles of electromagnetism, allowing the possibility of levitation and teleportation through the aether.    

The aether will naturally be discovered when **atom-smashing** fades in popularity because of its high cost and uselessness, and is replaced by **atom-shaking** which can be done with ordinary electronics.

<!-- a natural symmetry, as polarity, arises from 2 forces, positive and negative, going against each other. This creates vortices in each of the 5 Elements (strong, weak, electromagnetism, spacetime, aether). 

This natural polarity is also seen by Physics. 

The problem is that spacetime and aether are not detectable by instruments which can only detect up to electromagnetism.

This is why dark matter cannot be detected and why SUSY fails.

This is solved by using the mind to detect dark matter and dark energy since the mind is made of aether and is superior to spacetime. This will reveal dark energy and dark matter to be properties of spacetime. 

SUSY then applies to spacetime as clockwise and counterclockwise blackholes as galaxies and quasars respectively. It means there is a right side up in outer space.



Hawking explains that the concept of supersymmetry implies that force and matter are really just 2 facets of the same thing:
- each matter particle, such as a quark, should have a partner force particle.
- each force particle, such as the photon, should have a partner matter particle.

This can solve the problem of infinities: 
- The infinities from closed loops of force particles are positive
- The infinities from closed loops of matter particles are negative

When electrons were first discovered orbiting the nucleus, physicists tried to predict their movements using Newton's Laws as F=m(v2/r).

However, it didn't work. So Einstein tried to use his Special Relativity and it also didn't work.

Niels Bohr solved it by proposing that the electrons followed pre-defined energy levels from the aether. 

This led to Quantum Mechanics for small-scale movements which was based on state-change, in line with Descartes' Physics wherein internal state is the source of movement. This is different from Newtonian Physics where external forces are the cause of movement.

Like Newton, Einstein's General Relativity also believes that movement comes from outside, as external mass that 'warps' spacetime. 

General Relativity, which explains large-scale movements, is thus in opposition to Quantum Mechanics, which explains small-scale movements. 

To unify both, physicists invented string theory wherein particles become threads which integrate with the fabric of spacetime.

In this way, it uses predefined levels, as "dimensions", like Quantum Mechanics in the small-scale, and the arbitrary warping of spacetime in the large scale.


### General Relativity is False

The big problem with this is that General Relativity is a false theory to begin with because it negates the aether by enshrining electromagnetism which is inferior both to the aether and spacetime. 

This makes spacetime arbitrary, leading to make-your-own-spatecimes like Taub-Nut, Godel, DeSitter, etc. 

As a result, General Relativity messes up Quantum Mechanics and renders it forever incomplete. 


This is similar to Ptolemy's geocentric theory which also was accurate and was able to predict the measurements of astronomical bodies. However, it started to collapse when it started to make wrong predictions. 

Nowadays, General Relativity also has wrong predictions such as:
- dark matter, wormholes, and white holes that have never been found
- dark energy which does not have the same dynamics as gravity


String theory is really a Frankenstein theory that creates arbitrary dimensions. This arbitrariness makes it unscientific and untestable.

Descartes' Physics solves this by deleting Einstein's Relativity and replacing it with Poincare's Law of Relativity which is based on state change.

It instead proposes that all movement comes internally from the state of the core of a particle, object, planet, or galaxy. 

These states have predefined levels or ranges. The relative interaction of the states creates movement, whether as energy emission or gravitation. It also contracts space and dilates time depending on the relative wave-states.

These pre-defined ranges lead to Francis Bacon Tables. In this way, you don't compute things from scratch. Instead, you get the relevant data, then consult the table. From there, you can make your computations to get more precision. 

The manipulation of wave-states will therefore create anti-gravity and the teleportation of masses, both of which are impossible if you regard movement as coming from the outside.

Instead of arbitrary dimensions, there are 7 dimensions matching the different way the aetherspace can house distinct universes within the multiverse. -->
