The relation between magnetism and electricity was already documented by Gilbert in 1600. 

His [De Magnete](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33810/33810-h/33810-h.htm), it explains how amber, gems, and crystals are electricks (natural electromagnetic materials) that can produce magnetism and electricity.

This is now proven by diamonds becoming magnets via:
- HPHT (High-Pressure High Temperature)
- nitrogen-vacancy centers


## HPHT and Nitrogen-vacancy Centers

HPHT uses 2 Cartesian principles:

1. Removing spacetime particles via pressure and heat 
2. Use the pressure and heat to create channels in the crystal to produce magnetism.

The ability of crystals to produce electricity by removing spacetime (by squeezing) is now called piezoelectricity.


Nitrogen-vacancy Centers (NVC) uses defects in diamonds to create electronic states in them through light. This then makes the diamond react to magnetic fields. 

The mechanism for this is the channel created by the NVC which is aligned by light or other electromagnetic means. 




Gilbert points to Avicenna as the source where he got his ideas about electromagnetism. 

So it follows that the Arabs knew about it beforehand. They obviously documented it, but the documentation was lost.

Descartes' contribution was to systematize electromagnetism, documenting the concept as the 1st Element. 

This is the foundation of our proposal for Crystal Computers to overcome the limitations of Moores Law on Semiconductors.

The problem is that Descartes' documentation was discarded after Newton's matter-based system became accepted in the 18th century. 

This is why we are brining back the ideas of Gilbert and Descartes to make crystal computers a reality.


<!-- This is why you say that "the relation between magnetism and electricity was not known until 1830". 

In reality, you mean: The relation between magnetism and electricity was REDISCOVERED and REDOCUMENTED in 1830.
