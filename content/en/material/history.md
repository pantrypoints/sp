In a nutshell, Descartes vortex theory was never disproven. 

Newton's only objection to the vortex theory was about comets since Descartes mentioned 2 types of comets: one that goes around the sun and one that goes to other stars. 

Newton only knew the kind that goes around the sun which was predicted by Halley. 

No one has predicted the 2nd type of comet because no one has gone to another star. 

A lot of Descartes' predictions can only be tested if one goes to another star and observes the situation there. 

What really happened was Newton kept on giving precise theories that were based on the 3rd Element (matter) that discarded the all the others. 

This was the easy thing to do since the 3rd Element is easy seen and touched by all. This makes it countable in the 18th century. While light, spacetime, and the aether are all non-touchable and contactless and more abstract. 

They only had basic telescopes that could see the other material planets and this was where Newton's Physics established itself. 

Newton's Physics started breaking apart when electricity (1st Element) was discovered and the Newtonians had nothing to explain it. 

This was settled by Maxwell who explained the 1st Element as waves through the Huygens aether.

Then the Michelson Morley experiment debunked the Huygens aether which prompted Einstein to replace it with a sophistical fabric of spacetime. 

But his spacetime was not the 2nd Element and so it is incomplete and start breaking apart when galactic vortices (galaxy rotation and universe expansion) were discovered.  

And so Cartesian Physics solves all of these because it has all the 5 Elements. It even accounts for neutrinos through the 4th Element (water aether). This is why neutrinos are detected in liquid.
