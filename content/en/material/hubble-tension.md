Sure. The article mentions Sabti: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07049

But the popular one seems to be Gz9p3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00306

Then there is Riess which validates the Hubble tension: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1ddd

Gz9p3 has a Lyman break of 9.35 and MUV of −21.66. These show that it is very far yet very bright and massive. 

To address this anomaly, Gz9p3 researchers advise a revision of the star formation model. This is similar to the Sabti conclusion which is more direct at favoring dark matter halo mass.  

In February 2024, Riess et al published verification from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on the speed of the expansion of the universe via light which is 73 km/s/Mpc. This speed is very different from that verified by the Planck satellite which got 67 km/s/Mpc. 

A singular universe cannot possibly have 2 different speeds just as your car cannot have 2 speedometers giving totally different values. It would mean one of them is wrong.  

For measuring the speed of the expansion of the universe, physicists use 2 major methods:

1. Through the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measured by the Planck Satellite. We can call this the 'heat' approach

This measures the speed of expansion between Earth and the rest of the fabric of space through the 'radio static' CMB that is everywhere. This static is evidence that the universe was hotter in the past. This primordial heat is then use as evidence for a hot material Big Bang which is now the standard model of cosmology.   

Because the CMB represents energy as heat, it fits with Einstein's General Relativity perspective which uses the relationship of elecrtomagnetic potential (mass) with the heat, as E=mc2. This method plugs in matter and dark matter to the CMB fluctuations in order to come up with the expansion speed of the universe. This is why the current Big Bang model is called Lambda Cold Dark Matter. 

The CMB is also used by Relativists such as Roger Penrose as the basis of their theories, such the Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) theory which tries to explain what existed before the Big Bang.


2. Through Visible and infrared light measured by the JWST and the Hubble Telescope. We can call this the 'wave' approach

This measures the speed of expansion between Point A and Point B. This uses Doppler wave principles, which is already well-proven on Earth, instead of General Relativity. Unlike General Relativity which uses the relationship between mass and heat, this uses the relationship between light-waves and space. 

As such, this method is far simpler, yet superior and more in line with Nature. The findings of the JWST shows that the acceleration of space is different depending which galaxy you ask. 

This is not in line with Einstein's Theory of Relativity, but is totally in line with Poincare's Law of Relativity which is based on the states of the bodies in question, instead of their mass or energy.
