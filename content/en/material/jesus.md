The ancient Greeks had a creation story wherein [the god Paethon rode his solar chariot](/research/socrates/timaeus/chapter-02) too close to the Earth, burning and destroying parts of it.

In Plato's Timaeus, this story is debunked by an old Egyptian priest who revealed that Paethon really represented a meteorite shower that destroyed large parts of Europe. It did not fall on Egypt and this allowed Egypt to be more advanced than Europe. 

The Egyptian clarified that antiquity is full of myths like these which should not be taken literally, but also should not be ignored as they contain important facts. 

The Gospel of Judas also has such a creation story from Jesus. He asserts that creator-angels each used 5 angels to facilitate the creation of each world.   

1. Yaoth
2. Harmathoth
3. Galila
4. Yobel
5. Adonaios


We find that the Jesus Cosmology Model fits neatly into our 5 Elements Model, derived from Timaeus and Descartes, proving that the principles of the universe stay the same regardless of time.

Jesus adds new information when he asserts that the 5 angels are NOT the cause of the problems in each world. Instead, the problems are cause by the error of the stars. 

The idea that stars cause events in physical reality was weakly hinted at by Descartes, but strongly asserted by Kepler. 

In fact, Kepler successfully used Brahe's astronomical data to make correct astrological predictions. We could even say that he really used astronomy to promote astrology. However, no one was able to replicate his prediction system and so astrology died out after Kepler died. 

The main difference between Kepler's Cosmology and that of Jesus is that Kepler believed that the 5 Elements were the planetary orbits within a star (as the 5 Platonic Solids), whereas Jesus correctly believed that stars are within the 5 Elements (now as the Standard Model of Physics).

The correct emphasis of Jesus and Kepler on stars fixes the ambiguity of Descartes and Timaeus, whereas the correct organization of Descartes and Timaeus on the 5 Elements fixes the errors of Jesus and Kepler. 

Jesus' Cosmology Model can thus boost Kepler's advocacy to use star-data to predict events on Earth so that humans will not be caught off guard. 



### Update July 2025

The capacity of stars to affect physical reality is also evidenced by the Essassani who talk about the influence of the Orion star system on Earth starting 6,000 years ago that caused the ancient conflicts in the Middle East as well as modern Nazism, and by PR Sarkar who talked about Magha star causing the Nazi oppression and World War 2. And so logically, the Magha star is in the Orion system.

<!-- The universe of Timaeus, Jesus, and ours has one and the same physics and therefore the same cosmology.  -->
