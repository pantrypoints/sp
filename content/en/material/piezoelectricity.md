squeezing makes the dipoles asymmetrical. This gives it a net negative charge on one side, which then releases energy. 

Descartes on the other hand. Ratio - Fire-aether more than spacetime. This overcomes the insulation of spacetime and liberates the electricity, allowing it to flow ot. You do not need to know the atoms in each molecule as to compute the charges. All you need is to detect the states of the cryasl before and after the squeezing. The comparison of the 2 states will give you a basis for further exptrapolation.
