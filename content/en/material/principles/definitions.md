[Charge](/charges) | Rotation direction of that particle 
Gravitational Signature | | the unique code or idea that is the basis for the discrete entity. In a living body, this manifests as its DNA
[Magnetic Field](/material/principles/part-3/chapter-03c/) | The flow of virtual photons around that hole
Magnetic Moment | A hole in particles for virtual photons to pass through
Magnetism | The tendency for materials to attract and repel independent of gravitation
[Monad](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-05/) | A 1-dimensional Substance
Quantum | the smallest unit of Substance
Quantum of Aether | Qoa | Substance of idea, feeling, or the abstract mind or soul that has those ideas and feelings
