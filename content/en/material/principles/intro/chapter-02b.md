There are 5 Layers in Reality | Each Layer has 3 Sublayers Representing 3 Influences 
{{< /dc >}}


Chapter 1 explained that the universe is made up of waves categorized into 5 layers. 

Each wave moves up and down, as a result of the belligerence of the Positive and Negative Forces, from its zero level.

We call this zero or average level as the **central signature or dharma** for that wave.

This means that a wave has 3 kinds depending on its relation to that central signature. It can be:
- above that level -- we call this the subtlifying influence (sattvaguna)
- within that level -- we call this the transformative influence (rajoguna)
- below that level -- we call this the crudifying influence (tamoguna)

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sub.jpg" alt="Sublayers" c="The material waves are most obvious to humans which are also made up of material bodies" >}}

These [3 influences](/superphysics/principles/chapter-06b/) produce the 3 sublayers:
- upper
- middle
- lower


For example, the Material layer will have 3 sublayers with each with its own force or media, and quantum:

Layer | Sublayer | Medium | Quantum
--- | --- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Upper | mom1 (gas, bose condensate) | qom1 (Up-Down Quarks)
. | Middle | mom2 (liquid) |  qom2 (Strange-Down Quark)
. | Lower | mom3 (solid) | qom3 (Top-Bottom Quark)

## The Internal Boundary

Within the sublayers is an internal boundary that separates the upper from the middle and lower sublayers. 

- Above the boundary, the sublayer has more quasi-physical than physical properties. 
- Below the boundary, the sublayer has more physical ones. 

For example, a well known boundary is the Higgs Field which we regard as the internal boundary within the Radiant Layer.

- Below the Higgs Field, particles acquire measurable **potential energy**, called mass in Modern Physics, in Million electron Volts or MeV.  
- Above the Higgs Field, particles such as photons and 'gravitons' have no mass. This is because particles above the boundary are kinetic instead of potential. 


This gives us 5 Boundaries:

Boundary | Physics Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal Internal Boundary (aib) | Edge of Identity | Separates aethereal identities that can be split up
Spatial Internal Boundary (sib) | Edge of Universe | Separates space from aetherspace
Radiant Internal Boundary (rib) | Higgs Field | Separates identities with potential energy
Convertible Internal Boundary (cib) | X17 | Separates left-hand-interacting identities 
Material Internal Boundary (mib) | ? | Separates "protons" from "mesons"


<!-- identities with can be further split up (manifesting as splitting up)  that can be split up by antimatter -->
<!-- 
Energy and the 2 Forces manifest via Media differently in the 5 layers and each of the sublayers.

Sublayer | Quantum | Media | 2 Forces
--- | --- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Mind  | Sound | Existence or Nonexistence
Middle Aethereal | Qoa (Idea) | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Lower Aethereal | Thought | Sound | Consonance or Dissonance
Upper Spatial | Metaphysical Spacetime (Multiverses) |  |  
Middle Spatial | Galactic Qost | Universe | Fast or slow
Lower Spatial | Qost | Space and time within a universe | Gravity or Anti-gravity
Upper Radiant | Muon | Mor1 (Infrared) | Bright or Dark
Middle Radiant | Electron | Mor2 (Visible Light) | Energetic or non-energetic
Lower Radiant | Tau | Mor3 (UV Light) | Magnetic or Nonmagnetic
Upper Convertible | Z Boson |  |  
Middle Convertible | W- Boson | Radioactivity | Persistence or Decay
Lower Convertible | W+ Boson |  | 
Upper Material | Up Quark | Gas | Persistence | Blue Charge
Middle Material | Down Quark | Liquid | Persistence | Green Charge
Lower Material | Strange Quark | Solid | Persistence | Red Charge

<!-- Layer | Energy | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
Upper Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | 
Lower Aethereal | Strength of idea or feeling | Sound
Upper Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Lower Spatial | Strength of a vortex (black hole) | Gravity
Upper Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Lower Radiant | Energy in a photon or electron | Heat and Light
Upper Convertible | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Convertible | Energy in a W Z boson | Stability
Material | Energy in an atomic nucleus | Identity -->


## The Hierarchy of the Layers

From the Medium-Substance-Quantum (MSQ) Table in Chapter 3, we can deduce that everything in existence has varying degrees of the following qualities:

Layer | Quality
--- | --- 
Aethereal | Audibility or Harmony 
Spatial | Contact
Radiant | Visible Form
Convertible | Stability
Material | Identifiability


The layers work in a hierarchy.
- The aether is the most superior and subtle
- Matter is the most inferior and crude. 

This hierarchy explains why gravity affects light and heat, but light and heat does not affect gravity. 

For example, adding heat to a rock will not make it float. Shining light on a rock will reveal its identity, but not make it heavier or lighter.

<!-- In Social Superphysics, this is why those who know the 5 Layers (or 5 Elements) tend to be non-democratic. This is because, in order to full utilize or maximize the benefits of Nature's hierarchy, wild democracy has to be stamped out. This increases the chances for 'Golden Ages' in a civilization.

In Bio Superphysics, this hierarchy principle manifests as Homeopathy or Chinese medicine having less bad side effects than Western Medicine.  -->


### Cleaning Up The Sciences

Science was created by the Europeans who built knowledge from the bottom material layer -- the most inferior but most obvious one. 

From the bottom, they worked their way up:

Layer | European Discovery
--- | ---
Matter | Contact Forces, Monetary Systems
Convertible | Chemistry and Nuclear Reactions
Radiant | Electricity, International Finance


This led to a messy, fragmented, and non-intuitive system of knowledge. For example:
- Physics is now split into Particle Physics and Quantum Physics
- Medicine is split into Western Medicine and Alternative Medicine 
- Economics is split into Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Behavioral Economics, Welfare Economics, etc. 

We clean up this mess by:
- putting all knowledge into the 5 Layers, and
- adding the 2 Forces as its operators.

These then create everything in reality.



## Organization of the 5 Layers in This Work

The principles of Material Superphysics is organized under the following headings which become Chapters.


Chapter | Description
--- | ---
1 | Intro
2 | Sublayers
3 | Medium
4 | Substance
5 | Quantum
6 | Conservation, Spin
7 | Action
8 | Relationality

The error begins in 7:00 when neutrinos are equated to hot dark matter. 

In Cartesian Physics, neutrinos would be the Water Element now called Weak Force. This is why neutrinos are revealed by liquids. 

CDM are space particles of 2nd Element or Air, now called Gravitation. 

CDM and neutrinos go together in Flamingo simulations because water needs air. 

The aether 5th Element has a liquid nature. This is why there is an association with variable dark energy with variable neutrino mass, as opposed to material and electromagnetic masses which are fixed. 

Rather, it is better to say that the mass of neutrinos are irrelevant, and so constraining their mass is useless. 

This is because neutrinos use their 'mass' to propel themselves within the 2nd Element. 

The main purpose of neutrinos is to provide supplementary information to photon information. This is consistent with the ANITA neutrinos. 

Such information is esssential to make a teleportation map that is already used by UFOs. 

So you only constrain neutrino mass when you need to make a teleportation map in real-time. We explain here: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0tCcUN9T4oQ
