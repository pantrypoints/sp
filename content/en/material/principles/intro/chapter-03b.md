There are 5 Layers in Reality | The MSQ Classification makes it easier to classify things within the 5 Layers 
{{< /dc >}} -->


## The Superphysics Naming Convention for Particles

To make Physics easier to understand, we classify everything in Existence into three:

1. Medium
2. Substance
3. Quantum

**Substance** is the essence of things or identities that we perceive.  

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations Simplified, Part 3">}}
I think of myself as a thing that thinks and is not extended. I also think of the stone as a thing that is extended and does not think. The two conceptions differ enormously. But they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common. 
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations Simplified, Part 6">}}
Sensory ideas must be produced by some substance other than me. This substance actually has all the reality that is represented in the ideas that it produces. This substance is either a body, or it is God.
{{< /q >}}


Both physical things such as rocks, and metaphysical things such as a soul, have substance or essence in common. 

**Quantum** is the smallest part of substance.

{{< q a="Hegel" c="Science of Logic, Book 2, Article 814" >}}
In logic, essence occupies the same place as quantity in the sphere of being. Essence has absolute indifference to limitation [*essence is unlimited*]. But quantity is this indifference in an **immediate** determination. It gains a limit due to its immediate external determinateness and becomes a quantum [*quantum is limited essence or substance. Quantum is created when the mind forcibly quantizes the inherently-illogical or arbitrary substance so that the mind can use logic on the naturally-illogical*].
{{< /q >}}


Substance is free whereas quantum is confined. 
- Substance is general
- Quantum is specific

**Medium** is how a substance of quantum is perceived. 

{{< q a="Hegel" c="The Phenomenology of Spirit, Introduction" >}}
If knowledge is not an instrument, but is instead a kind of passive medium through which the light of the truth reaches us, then here too we do not receive the Absolute as It is. Instead, we get the medium-version of the Absolute.
{{< /q >}}

To transmit these substances and quanta, this medium must be dynamic and therefore have inherent force. This is why we regard:
- force as media
- matter and identity as substance and quanta

Therfore, everything in the universe is either a Medium or a Substance.
- **Medium** is where force works through.
- **Substance** is the discrete identity that reacts to the force.
- **Quantum** is the smallest perceivable unit of Substance. This contains the gravitational signature. 

We can say that:
- media are force particles
- susbstances and quanta are non-force particles


### The 5 Elements

The ancients classified all phenomena into 5 Elements, 3 of which are known to Modern Physics:

Superphysics "Layers" | Greek-Hindu-Chinese "Elements" | Physics "Standard Model"
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Probability | Metaphysical | Probability
Aethereal | Aether, Akasha, 水 (still water) | Pseudo-science
Spatial | Air, Vayu, 木 (moving wood) | Gravity
Radiant | Fire, Tejas, 火 (expanding fire) | Electromagnetism
Convertible | Water, Jala, 土 (changing earth) | Weak 
Material | Earth, Pritvi, 金 (solid metal) | Strong 


{{< i s="/graphics/super/domains.svg" a="Layers" >}}

<!--  create a naming system based on the 5 Elements of Aether, Graviton, Electromagnetism, Weak, and Strong Forces, which we rename into Aether, Spacetime, Radiant, Convertible, and Material. 

We replace the following Physics names with Superphysics ones:

Physics Name | Superphysics Name
--- | ---
quark | qom
electron | qor
light | mor2 -->

Noticably absent in Physics is the aethereal layer or element which serves as:
- the backstage for the physical stage
- the code for the physical app

This stage and app interacts with the audience or users, where the audience are the perceivers of phenomena. 

This is why Physics is unable to pin down causal mechanisms just as:
- a stage-play that does not use a backstage will lead to a messy show that has stage and backstage elements together, like how Physics mixes up cause and effect
- an app that does not let you access its code will not let you fix its bugs or find out the causes of app behavior


We then integrate the Medium-Substance-Quantum model with the 5 Elements model. 

<!-- Modern Physics was created from the lowest Material layer (Strong Force), working its way upwards to the Convertible (Weak Force) and then to the Radiant (Electromagnetic). -->

<!-- In contrast, Superphysics is created from the top Aethereal layer working downwards to the Material. This allows us to see all particles and forces from the highest viewpoint and reclassify them in a proper and intuitive way. -->

Instead of the messy and arbitrary naming of Fermions, Bosons, Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, etc., we use base the name on:
- whether it is a medium, substance, quantum and
- the Layer involved


**Physics Concept** | **Superphysics Counterpart**
--- | ---
Fermions | Non Media
Bosons | Media 
Baryon-Hadron | Convertible-Material
Meson-Hadron | Material (as free aetherspace)
Leptons | Radiant-Convertible

<!-- All forces such as gravity, electromagnetism, contact forces are manifestations of the 2 Forces, which are aethereal in nature. -->

Instead of unsystemic arbitrary names such as gluons, quarks, electrons, we use acronyms that show an identity's place in the model.

Physics Particle | Superphysics Particle
--- | ---
Photon | mor (Medium of Radiance)
Electron | qor (Quantum of Radiance)
Neutrino | qoc (Quantum of Conversion)
Gluon | mom (Medium of Matter)
Quark | qom (Quantum of Matter)


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/msq.svg" alt="Superphysics 5 Layer Model" cap="The Superphysics MSQ Model uses a simpler naming convention for particles. Note how there is no such thing as an atom-substance, but rather a proton to represent the material layer. This is consistent with the periodic table of elements, which we call vom or versions of matter, being based on proton number" >}}


<!-- The differences between the Physics model and the Superphysics one are:
- Neutrons and Protons are an essential substance or quanta even if it is not a fundamental particle in Physics
- In Superphysics, quark 'colors' are merely representations of the 3 Influences of Crudifying, Transforming, and Subtlifying   
- The Superphysics model extends all the way to the Aethereal -->


## The Gap in Knowledge in Modern Physics

The MSQ model is much better-organized because it is made from the perspective of Nature in totality, instead of from the limited perceptions of humans.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/standard.png" alt="The Standard Model" cap="The Standard Model overlaid on the MSQ model. Notice the huge gap in knowledge needed to be bridged" >}}

This exposes a huge gap in knowledge, mostly with the upper layers of the aether and spacetime. Even the lower layers have some gaps such as:
- variations of neutrons and protons
- the internal boundaries of the convertible and material

Knowing the internal boundaries of the lower layers will help create new compounds and sub-states of matter. 

For now, we hypothesize 2 additional versions of protons and neutrons to fill the gaps which we got from accounts of alien technology:

Name | Physical Example 
--- | --- 
soc1 (upper neutron) | ?
soc3 (lower neutron) | Neutron weapons (Lazar from Grays)
som1 (upper proton) | Element 115 (Lazar from Grays)
som3 (lower proton) | Indestructible metals (Essassani)
