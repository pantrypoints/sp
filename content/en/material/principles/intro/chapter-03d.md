The different particles in the MSQ model have different sizes and densities that help explain their interaction or non interaction with each other. 

We rank them according to size. 

Rank | Particle | Size | Density
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Macro aetherspace (Dark Energy) | largest | low
2 | Aetherspace (Atomic Space) | large | high 
3 | Spacespan (Space particles) | large | lowest
4 | Heat | medium | high
5 | Neutrinos | small | low
6 | Photon | small | medium 
7 | Quarks (Micro Aetherspace)  | tiny | highest
8 | Electrons | 2nd tiniest | high
9 | Virtual Photons | tiniest | high


The macro aetherspace is the largest particle as evidenced by dark energy being the larges part of the universe. 

It can also:
- expand as proven by UFOs as Bob Lazar's Gravity A waves and by 
- contract  as proven by levitating Buddhist monks and lighter pyramid blocks

The smallest particle is the virtual photon which can go through electrons and create spin.

Neutrinos are larger than electrons but are low density like space particles. This allows them to go through matter. 

Heat particles are of medium size. Like virtual photons, this allows them to piggy back on space particles whith are larger and cause spatial forces. 
- Unlike virtual photons that cause spatial attraction and repulsion, heat particles cause spatial expansion and contraction.
