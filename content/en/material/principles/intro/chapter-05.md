Chapter 1 introduced the idea of abstract particle shapes which are different from actual physical point particles.

These shapes come from the belligerence between the 2 Forces, the same principle that gives 'shapes' and 'spin' to ideas.

An idea can be:
- big or small
- powerful and viral, or weak and insignificant

Likewise, particles in the abstract can be:
- big or small
- have strong or weak spins

In the West, the concept of abstract shapes having physical effects was first known through Pythagoras. His ideas influenced Plato, leading to the Platonic solids.

In Asia, this concept is:
- in mandalas and yantras in Hinduism
- in i-ching and bagua and in Taoism

<!-- Superphysics sees ideas as static metaphysical objects that have a certain [geometry](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03e). This was what Euclid's Element was all about: -->


## The Abstract Shapes of the 5 Elements

We apply the concept of abstract shapes to the quanta of the MSQ Model of the 5 Layers which was fully explained by Euclid in his book aptly called *The Elements*.

Euclid | Topic | Layer 
--- | --- | ---
Book 1 | Triangles | Aethereal
Book 2 | Rectangles | Spatial
Book 3 | Circles | Radiant
Book 4 | Circles in Squares | Convertible
Book 5 | Ratios | Relationality
Book 6 | Numbers | Material


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/euclid.jpg" a="Euclid Postulates" c="The 5 Postulates match the nonrelational dynamics of the 5 Elements" >}}


Shallow people judge with their eyes and thought that Euclid was explaining visual shapes.
- And so they think his book was about shapes.

In reality, he was talking about the dynamics of the 5 Elements. Kepler and Descartes did the same in an indirect way. 


## How it Works

The Euclidean Postulates can be suummed up in a few words:

1. Point to Point

We interpret this as the aether particle.

2. Infinite Line

We interpret this as the finite aetherspace that can extend indefintely.

3. Circle

We interpret this as the "round" action of photons which are shaped as circle in a line.

4. Right Angles

We interpret this as the left and right handed spin of the Weak Interaction

5. Meeting at a Point

We interpret this as the triangle created by gluon flux tubes (3 aetherspace particles). 


Particles are divided into force and nonforce.
- Force particles are bolts or screws
- Nonforce particles are nuts or washers

They are small columns, hollowed out with 3 spirals like screw-threads. This lets them pass through those narrow passages while twisting

Force particles drill through non-force particles which we can call receivers. 
- Motion and spin comes from force particles that are transferred to receivers

These shape-based conceptions allow us to define quantal and substantial phenomena.

Physics Name | Superphysics Version
--- | ---
Magnetic Moment | Size of Hole of Charged (or Gendered) Particle
Electrical Charge | Abundance or Lack of Receivers (when there could be receivers)
Male Charge | Abundance of Receiver
Female Charge | Lack of Receiver
Spin | Effort or Potential for Action
Electromagnetic Mass | Depth of Hole to use Virtual Photons
Material Mass | Aetherspace Strength
Female Terminal (Cathode) | Entrance of electrons (positive in Physics)
Male Terminal (Anode) | Exit of electrons (negative in Physics)

## Particle Shapes Describe Particle Mechanics Better

This visualization will help us intuitively think of particle interactions.

Particle shapes remove the need for Feymann diagrams. This is because Feynman used action principles to trace **paths** in quantum mechanics.

But the problem is that particle paths are the effect of particle **spin**. So we use particle shapes to describe the spin that will necessarily lead to paths.

This is how meteorologists plot typhoon movement from their eye. 

<!-- For example, there is currently a mystery why there is a discrepancy between the predicted mass of the W boson and the actual measured mass. 

Our shapes system gives a clue that the culprit is in the neutrinos. This is because in our classification, neutrinos are in the same Layer as the W Boson, but have a flat shape. -->

{{< dc t="How We Got These" >}}
We derived these shapes after listing down:

1. The steps in our theory of how the Supreme creates reality in real time

This is the creation of particles of downgrade from idea to matter.

2. The effects of the Radiant layer particles namely the photon (light) and virtual photon (magnetism)  

This is how the particles interact. 

3. The steps of particle decay from collisions

This is the decay of particles or upgrade from matter back to the aether.
