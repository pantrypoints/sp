Each of the 5 Layers (Elements in Cartesian Physics) implements a Conservation Law in order to maintain the balance in the universe because:
- our universe is really one Supreme Entity, as a single unit
- a change in one aspect or part affects the whole  


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Article 42" >}}
[The 2nd Rule of movement] proves immutability of God's operation, conserving the world now with the same action with which He once created it. God from the start moved its various particles in different ways and arranged them so that some particles would impel others and transfer their motions to them. He conserves motion by letting those motions pass from one to another as they encounter each other. Thus, this continuous alteration of creatures itself is an argument for the immutability of God.

This leads to 5 Conservation Laws, 1 for each Layer.

Layer | Conservation Law
--- | ---
Aethereal | Idea or Identity
Spatial | Momentum
Radiant | Energy 
Convertible | Aether 
Material | Mass

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/layers.png" a="Conservation Laws" >}}

Each law has its implementing rules which will be discussed in each Part for each layer. 

In summary:
- the singleness of the Supreme means that a change in one part *affects* all others.
- this affecting of parts is called relationality
- the job of relationality is to conserve the singleness of the unit

Modern Physics sees the Conservation Laws as the effect of Symmetry. 
- Physics is therefore wrongly seeing the effect as the cause. 

In contrast, Material Superphysics sees physical constants and the fundamental forces (i.e. Standard Model) as the Effect of Conservation Laws which in turn are the effect of the Supreme Entity being a single entity.

## The Law of Conservation of Identity

This is the Material Superphysics version of the Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics.

This operates in the aethereal layer and is the foundation of the gravitational signature which this law says must be unique. 

This then leads to movement as those signatures adhere to this law in the physical domain.


## The Law of Conservation of Momentum 

This operates in the spatial layer and is the foundation of Descartes' 4 Rules of Motion which are the implementing rules for this law.

We can say that the rules of motion are the implementing rules for this law. 


## The Law of Conservation of Energy

This operates in the radiant layer and is already well known in Physics. Energy is the crudified and more obvious version of momentum.

This actually changes the energy from electromagnetic to material motion. For example, a generator converts electromagnetic force into physical motions. 


## The Law of Conservation of Aether 
<!-- Substance -->

This operates in the convertible layer which facilitates chemical changes and "flavor changing" which then creates the diversity of the material layer below it. 

This is because the Conversion layer converts matter into energy and vice versa. 

Flavor changing is a good and natural word for this layer because traditionally this was called the Water Element. 

It is the wetness of water and liquids that allows both:
- the perception of tastes by our tongue
- the detection of neutrinos by large liquid detectors


## The Law of Conservation of Mass

This operates in the material layer and is already well known in Physics. 

Matter is facilitated by the static aetherspace and is the most crudified version of the aether.
