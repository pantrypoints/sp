The aethereal layer is the first and highest layer in our 5 layers model and will be known as the Fifth Force in Modern Physics.

### Definition of the Aethereal Layer

The aether is the substance of ideas, feelings, and of the abstract mind or soul that has those ideas and feelings. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/aether.jpg" a="Aether" >}}

In Superphysics, the universe is an idea of the Supreme. Therefore:
- particles and objects are Its Thoughts
- forces are its Feelings

These go into the Aethereal Layer in the 5 Layer Model of Material Superphysics. 

So the aether is the substance of the physical and quasi-physical universe.



Generally, within Material, Bio, and Spiritual Superphysics, the aether is the building block of ideas and feelings, and of the mind that has those ideas and feelings.

This is why aethereal ideas and feelings can only be detected by the aethereal mind, being on the same layer, and not by electronic instruments of the Radiant Layer which is 2 layers below.  

The aether of the Material Superphysics (in the 5 Layer model) is a bit different from the aether of Bio Superphysics (5 Elements model) and Spiritual (5 Strata Model) Superphysics. This is fully explained in the 3 Operational Divisions of Reality. 

**The aether of the Material Superphysics has no life.** 

We define life as self-expressiveness. So the lack of life means that the particle relies on the expression of the whole, or that it has no self-expression. Rather it is expressing on behalf of something else. 

For example, light that hits a red ball will express red on behalf of the red aetherspace (gluon field) of that ball's surface. That light is totally dependent on the aetherspace that it hits. 

So the aether in Material Superphysics is **the abstract "ontological" part of Existence that defines or sets each nonliving identity**. 

> The aetheral layer is the abstract part of Existence that defines or sets each nonliving identity

This is consistent with life being the separator between Material and Bio Superphysics. 

Life and nonlife in turn is decided by the Positive (Yang or Shiva) and Negative (Yin or Shakti) Forces.  



### The Monad or Prime Radiant

The 5 Layers Aether is ultimately made up of Leibniz monads which are its "quantum" particle. This monad is explained differently by different philosophers.

Name | Writer | Nuance
--- | --- | --- 
Monad | Leibniz | Dynamics
Monad | Pythagoras | Number
Prime Mover | Aristotle | Cause
Prime Radiant | Essassani | Brahma
Substance | Spinoza | Brahma
Microvita | PR Sarkar | Dynamism


The best definition is from the Essassani, which is an alien race in the Orion system. They explain it as the smallest unit of "All There Is" (Brahma) that creates reality by travelling at infinite speeds. 

- the word "Prime" fits our description of the aether as being the highest layer and Aristotle's prime mover
- the word "Radiant" fits our description of outflow or radiant dynamics (called entropy by Physics) that leads to change and therefore time. This leads to the timespace particle of the Spatial Layer below it as the connector. This radiance also matches the inherent dynamism and arbitrariness of the aether as opposed to the staticity, rigidity, and persistence of matter

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="Metaphysics Book 5, Part 11" >}}
The prime mover is a beginning absolutely.

<!-- The ancient Greeks, Kepler, Descartes, and the Asian sciences (Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism) all attributed all the motions in the universe to God through it. In Hinduism, the aether is the *akasha*.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World by Descartes Simplified, Chapter 5" >}}
The philosophers assure us that above the clouds there is an aethereal air much subtler than ours. That air is not composed of vapors of the earth, but is an element in itself
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Socrates" c="Simple Phaedo by Plato, Chapter 9" >}}
But the true earth is pure and situated in the pure heaven—there are the stars also. It is the heaven which we commonly call the aether. Our own earth is the sediment gathering in the hollows beneath it.
{{< /q >}} -->


<!-- ### The Aether Dominates and is the Most Subtle

The aether is the highest and most important layer in the universe. It is the start of existence in the quasi-physical domain (since the previous layer is Probability which is only theoretical). -->

This layer dominates and rules the other four layers, just like spacetime dominates light as to give it a speed limit, and electromagnetism dominates matter as to prevent two rocks from merging or passing through each other. 

In terms of creation, this layer is the first layer that precedes physical manifestation. Since it is above spacetime, it is beyond Einstein's rule that nothing can travel faster than light. Thus, time travel and teleportation to other multiverses is facilitated by this layer.

We write aether with an "a" to differentiate it from the *ether* of science. This is similar to writing dialectics as "Socratic Dialectics" to set it apart from the corrupted dialetics of Marx. 


### Matter and Force are One as Idea

In the 3 lowest layers of Material, Conversion, and Radiance, force particles are seperate from matter particles. This is because the separation is done by the Spatial Layer. 

In the 2 highest layers, the Spatial and Athereal, the force and matter are interchangeable. In the highest layer, they are one and the same. 

<!-- Einstein claims that the Michelson and Morley experiment disproved the ether. In reality, it merely proved that the aether does not reside in the spacetime layer, but in its own layer as the aethereal layer. -->
