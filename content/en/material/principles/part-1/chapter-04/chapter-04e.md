The uniqueness of identities creates so many relations to other identities. These are potentially infinite since all identities are changing. 

The similar identities create a relation that is within their identity space. 

This network of identities are within a perception space. This network is called a reality as a collapse of probabilistic waves of identity. 

<!-- ## Probability

The Probability Layer is above and covers the aethereal layer. This means it is above existence  and is only theoretical.  We can also call this pre-existence that binds existence. -->


{{< q a="Henri Poincare" c="" >}}
Predicted facts can only be probable. Every time the physicist reasons by induction, he consciously requires the calculus of probabilities. That is why I examine what this calculus is worth, and what dependence we may place on it.

When describing movement, Rene Descartes uses the word 'tend to'. This is because movement is inherently probabilistic. This is why Cartesian Physics has Quantum Mechanics built in.  

This is different from Newton or Einstein who formulated their laws of movement emhasizing total predictability. For example, Newton has a concept of absolute space. 

In Cartesian-Spinozan Physics, everything is relative and nothing is absolute, other than the Absolute Entity.

Intelligent beings might have laws of their own making. But they also have some which they never made. Before there were intelligent beings, they were a possibility.

This Layer will be explained in Superphysics in order to reduce the content of Material Superphysics. 

However, we can discuss its material aspects here, covered by Quantum Mechanics, specifically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Schrodinger Equation.   

<!-- > *This leads to the [Socratic Theory of Forms](/research/socrates/phaedo/chapter-8), which leads to Essences -->


### The Schrodinger Equation

Coming soon!


### The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle 

Coming soon!
