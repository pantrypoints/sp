Material Superphysics is based on the Aether, from Descartes' Physics (or Empedocles, or Vedic philosophy of India).

This is opposite of Physics which is based on Matter, from Newton's Physics (or Democritus, or Carvaka philosophy of India. 

This leads to different and opposing models for the universe.

The aether is the substance of ideas, feelings, and the soul and abstract mind that has those ideas and feelings. 

This means that the universe is an idea of the Supreme Mind. 
- Ideas have a spin, as proven by the word "spin doctor"
- Galaxies, Quasars, pulsars, stars, planets, etc are therefore big and small ideas of the Supreme

## The Fallacy of the Big Bang

The Newtonian belief that gravity comes from matter leads to the idea of a material Big Bang. 

This was postulated by the priest George Lemaitre after atomic theory was established. 

{{< q a="Georges Lemaitre" c="The Primeval Atom">}}
In this first phase of the expansion of space, starting asymptotically with a zero radius, we have particles of enormous velocities immersed in radiation.
{{< /q >}}


This was later apparently "proven" by the cosmic microwave background which was detected many years later. 

However, since Newton did not know the cause of gravity, then the cause of the Big Bang was also unknown. And so physicists could only guess how the universe began and how it will end. 

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, Book 1, Definitions" >}}
The quantities of these centripetal forces can be called accelerative, motive, absolute.. I do not bother to know where such an absolute force come from. I just want to give them a mathematical form.
{{< /q >}}


The Fallacy of the Big Bang was later seen through:
- The Hubble Tension where the expansion of the universe was measured to have different speeds
- James Webb Space Telescope finding 'impossible' galaxies


## The Solution: A Sponge Universe

In 1644, Descartes published his expansion theory with an analogy of a sponge:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 2, Article " >}}
A sponge full of water is different from a dry sponge because the wet sponge has wider pores. This makes its body more diffused over a larger physical space. But this does not mean that each sponge-particle has greater metaphysical space when wet than when dry. 
{{< /q >}}


This matches the current expansion of the universe which Physics compares to a balloon expanding.

{{< youtube ZvcdkNKxxoQ >}}

However, we stick to a sponge analogy because the balloon analogy causes matter to expand as well. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/space.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}


An expanding sponge keeps the matter of the sponge at the same density while matching the look of the cosmic web.
- The dark holes are made up of the 2nd Element called aetherspace
- The bright sopts and filaments are made up of the 3rd Element called matter, with the 2nd Element called space particles.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/balloon.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}

This also emphasizes the liquid property of space which manifests as:
- gravitational waves as proven by LIGO
- acoustic bubbles as proven by DESI as baryonic acoustic oscillations

The sponge universe has always existed and does not have a material start. 

<!-- Descartes explained that gravity comes from the aether which is the substance of ideas and souls or abstract minds. -->


## Dark Energy

Instead of a material singularity, the matter in the universe comes from the energy of space. This is proven by quarks that emerge out of space as a result of excessive imposition of energy.

The expansion is caused by 'dark energy' which we call the aetherspace which binds spacetime. 
- These are bubbles that pop up everywhere and manifests as baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs).  
- Bob Lazar calls them as Gravity-A waves, in contrast to Gravity-B which are space particles

This aetherspace facilitates both large-scale phenomena as well as quantum effects, unifying Classical and Quantum Mechanics.

## Heat Particles Solve the Hubble Tension

<!-- The CMB as local heat of cluster/s -->

The Hubble Tension is the difference in the expansion speed of the universe measured through red shift at 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (measured by James Webb) and through the CMB at 67 (measured by Planck Satellite). 

This is easily solved through the concept of heat particles which have a shorter range than light particles. This is obviously seen in a lightbulb 300 meters away -- we can see the light, but we cannot feel its heat. 

This means that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the heat from galaxies and space within or near our galactic cluster.
- The CMB has a short range
- Red shifted stars have a much longer range

This difference causes the Hubble Tension. 

<!-- This is because heat particles have a shorter range than light particles because they are larger.  -->


This matches the findings of DESI that shows expansion is faster in the distant universe which Physics wrongly interprets as going back in time!

This is further consistent with the James Webb Space Telescope that found very distant galaxies already well-formed. This proves that those very distant galaxies are not ancient, but rather just very distant.



The cause of these surprises was the false materialist belief called the [Big Bang Theory](/material/fallacies/big-bang) which says that the universe began as a primeval atom or singularity that exploded to create spacetime and the current galaxies. 

Such a theory would lead to the following predictions:
- There should be more galaxies at a certain region of the universe compared to others
- Old galaxies should be bigger than new ones
- Gravitational waves should be present because there was a huge singularity that created ripples in the fabric of space
- There should be more temperature differences because of the expansion

Such assumptions were destroyed by the findings of:
- the **James Webb Space Telescope** which detected galaxies at the early universe being large instead of small
- the **Planck satellite** which detected no gravitational waves in the CMB
- **DESI** detecting variations in the acceleration of the expansion of space



Since the aether or 5th Element is above spacetime or the 2nd Element, then the aether is not affected by space and time. 

This means that the universe is eternal and infinite. 


<!-- He described the expansion of space to be caused by the increase in space particles in an area without increasing the volume of matter. 

This forms a sponge or a web that can expand or contract. 
- Spacetime is the dense part of the universal sponge that contains matter and light
- The aetherspace is the thin dark part that fills the gaps -->

<!-- i s="/graphics/physics/balloon.jpg" a="Sponge Universe" c="The data from James Webb, DESI, and the Planck satellites jointly prove the dual nature of the 2nd Element or Spatial Layer" -->


<!-- The properties of the media of the spatial layer, as space and aetherspace, lead to an eternal and infinite sponge universe. -->



<!-- ## The Corruption in the Sciences

The corrupted assumptions of Physics, just like the corrupted ones of Economics, create theoretical absurdities that lead to real problems.

- The corrruption of Economics is the obsession with money
- The corrruption of Physics is the obsession with visible things

Physics is unable to process invisible things like spirit and mind, calling them pseudo-science. This forces them into simplistic theories that are based on visible effects instead of invisible causes:

- The universe needing to have a starting day is an idea from the Bible, proposed by the priest Lemaitre as the hypothesis of the primeval atom

- The force of gravity being based on matter is from Newton's ignorance on the cause of gravity

These dogmas combined leads to the Big Bang theory which has been disproven by the recent data.
