The Quantum of aether (qoa) is the monad. It is the smallest unit of an aethereal substance which takes the form of the universe.

The best explanation for a qoa is the Prime Radiant of the alien race called the Essassani. However, many people are allergic to the idea of aliens, so we use humans sources as:
- Leibniz
- Pythagoras
- Kepler 


According to Pythagoras and Kepler, motion is sourced from an invisible, immaterial "monad".


{{< q a="Diogenes" >}}
According to Pythagoras, the monad was the beginning of everything. From the monad proceeds an indefinite duad, which is subordinate to the monad. From the monad and the indefinite duad proceed numbers. From numbers proceed signs. From signs come lines which make up plane shapes. From plane shapes come solid bodies. From solid bodies come sensible bodies. These have 4 elements: fire, water, earth, and air.

Pythagoras | Material Superphysics
--- | ---
monad | monad
duad | 2 domains (dualistic existence)
numbers | identity
signs | timespace
lines and shapes | aetherspace (Cartesian extension)
solid bodies | spacetime

### The 3 Gunas 

We combine this with Asian philosophy to say that monads vibrate in 3 ways according to the 3 influences or gunas:


Influence | Position 
--- | ---
Subtlifying | Above the gravitational signature
Transformative | Within the gravitational signature
Crudifying | Below the gravitational signature


These monads then make up the aether particles as the substance of the aethereal layer. The quality of these monads then build the strength, dynamism, and size of the particles in the layers below the aethereal. 


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
Every substance has one principal attribute.
- Mind-substances have thinking as their one principal attribute.
- Body-substances have extension as their one principal attribute.
Thus:
- extension in length, width, and depth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance.
- thought is the nature of thinking substance
{{< /q >}}


In ancient natural philosophy, the aether was called the 'substance' that filled all of Existence. 

Since it is two layers above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch, then it is not visible nor tangible.

It is detected in 2 ways:

1. Directly through intution

Intuitional detection of the aether is explained by Bio Superphysics. 

2. Indirectly through patterns from the visible layers 

This will be done in Material Superphysics through Qualimath.

{{< q a="Leibniz" c="Monadology, Part 1">}}
Monads must have some qualities otherwise they would not be beings at all.. Every monad is necessarily different from every other monad.. Created monads have within themselves a certain perfection and self-sufficiency which makes them the source of their internal actions and incorporeal automata.

<!-- Kepler lists 5 kinds of monads: 2 are of the immaterial category and 3 are material. Instead of calling them cube, tetrahedron, etc we call them do, re, mi, sol, la, as Pythagoras' "sesquialter" and the Chinese pentatonic scale. 

"Do" is the monad of planets, "Sol" is the monad of stars such as our sun. Thus, "La" is the monad of galaxies.

Kepler calls the gravity between the monads as "kinship". -->

<!-- Instead of using light as a yardstick, Kepler uses the gravitational relativity between two monads. There are 20, such as:
- Do-Do
- Do-Re
- Do-Mi
- etc. 

Newton's Gravity is therefore `Do-Do` and `Do-Sol`. 

Einstein's Special Relativity is `Mi-Mi` and `Mi-Re`. 

General Relativity is `Mi-Do` and `Mi-Sol`.

Identities are created as an effect of the Negative Force splitting up waves into discrete quanta.

This is to facilitate a clearer perception of that identity or part of Nature as separate and unique from other parts. 

This means that the uniqueness of everything in the universe is caused by Negativity. 


## Gravitational Signatures

This uniquness of each identity is embodied in its gravitational signatures, which are inherently negative. 

Uniqueness creates differences which usually become belligerent or fricitional against each other, unless the Positive Force dominates.

With the Positive Force, the uniqueness is harmonized with those of others. This then leads to diversity. 

For example, without harmonization, hydrogen stays alone. But thanks to harmonization, there can exist various compounds such as:
- Water (H2O)
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Methane (CH4)



## Monads make up an Aether particle and the Gravitational Signature

Gravitational signatures are made up of monads just like a QR code is made up of black ink on paper or pixels on the screen.

![QR Code](/icons/qr.png)

- If the black ink is the monad as moa3, then its paper is physical existence or moa1
- If the pixels are the monad, then its background is physical existence


Since monads are subjective and not objective, they are explained by Superphysics, not by Material Superphysics.

The only concept that we need to know is that a monad makes up an aether particle. It is the aether that makes up all other particles. 


Layer | Aether Content
--- | --- |
Aethereal | 5
Spatial | 4
Radiant | 3
Convertible | 2
Material | 1

This is why we call the Aether as the 5th Element or Layer, and Matter as the 1st. 
- The waves more obviously take on a particle-shape and behavior from the Radiant Layer to the Material.
- The waves stay as waves in the Aethereal and Spatial Layers.


### The Gravitational Signatures or Dharma as the center of the Sublayers 

Each particle represents a wave. Each wave moves up and down, as amplitude, from its zero level.

We call this zero or average level as the **central signature or dharma** for that wave.

This means that a wave has 3 kinds depending on its relation to that central signature. It can be:
- above that level
- within that level
- below that level 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sub.jpg" alt="Sublayers" c="The material waves are most obvious to humans which are also made up of material bodies" >}}

These lead to 3 subelements or sublayers for each Element or Layer.
