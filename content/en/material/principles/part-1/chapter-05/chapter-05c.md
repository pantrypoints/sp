The Subtlifying Monad upgrades particles to go up the Layers.

This is seen in:
- particle decay
- proton smashing where a proton (3rd Element) upgrades into light, electrons, neutrinos, space particles, and the aether
- quasars and pulsars turning matter into energy 
- gas turning to bose condensate by removing energy and gaining a wave nature
