Each of the 5 Layers implements a Conservation Law in order to maintain the balance in the universe.

The Conservation Law for the Aethereal Layer is called:
- the Conservation of Identity in Material Superphysics
- the Conservation of Idea in Superphysics

The Pauli Exclusion Principle for material particles is one of the manifestations of this law.
- It says that matter particles cannot occupy the same energy levels, but media particles can

Material Superphysics explains that this is because matter particles are meant to be receivers for the media particles. 

Matter particles accept the energy from force or media particles based on the their receiving-configuration. 

This configuration is their svadharma or gravitational signature which must be unique, as opposed to media particles which are one unit and have dharma instead of svadharma.
