## Atomic Gravity: Electron Shells

Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom through electron shells. Unlike planetary orbits which are elliptical and sequential, electron shells are probabilistic. This is because:
- planetary orbits are within space-time
- electron shells are within the aetherspace

<!-- Fine structure 
Lamb shift 
Spin flip  -->

When a hydrogen atom is put under a magnetic field the electrons get change position and can emit light. This causes rings of light 

In "The Quantum Theory of Line-Spectra", Niels Bohr explains the mechanics of quantum theory that can work without Einstein's Special Relativity.

The problem began when Einstein explained quantum mechanics based on his quack principles of Relativity which is ultimately based on Boltzmann's energy (entropy). 

Bohr offers an alternative theory that is based instead of the aether, citing the aether-electron theory of Larmor and Lorentz. 

He applies this to the Zeeman effect wherein light is affected by magnetism as to cause perturbations in the light. 

Relativity says that the perturbations are caused by the relativity of the speed of electrons and the speed of light. 

Bohr, however, says that Relativity is wrong because it does not account for all the effects. Instead, Bohr points to the aether and how it can cause changes to the angular momentum of electron via magnetism as to explain the perturbations.

### How Cartesian Physics Explains the Zeeman Effect Through the Aetherspace

We agree with Both and instead use the aetherspace to explain the Zeeman effect which is triggered by a magnetic field.

{{<  youtube AWVgF4zlvdM >}}


In Cartesian Physics, a magnetic field is facilitated by invisible corkscrews which we call electron-fluid or sor (substance of radiance) but Physics calls "virtual photons". 

This sor has 3 aether particles. Passing a magnetic field into a cloud of atoms causes these particles to enter the aetherspace of the atom and strike the electron (which we call qor1).

The sor changes the state of the electron relative to the nucleus which makes it move up the shell with the sor. It then emits converts the sor into a real photon which represents the energy in the nucleus.

This makes the electron move down but not before gaining a new sor. It then emits this sor again as a photon in the other energy level.  

This creates 2 spectral lines while the electron jumps up and down as a response to the magnetic field. 


So Cartesian Relativity in the aetherspace between the electron and the nucleon is the cause of the Zeeman effect, not Special Relativity in spacetime.



<!-- Instead of the Relativity of speeds and reference frames, Bohr's mechanism is state-change and angular momentum by the aether. 

This is exactly the mechanism of Descartes' Physics, wherein state-change and angular momentum or spin makes up his 1st and 3rd rule of movement respectively. 

In contrast, Newton never regarded spin or angular momentum as a fundamental law of motion, making Newton's Laws perpetually deficient in  explaining all movement in the universe. 

Gaps in Newton are then filled up by Einstein's quackery.  

Under Relativity, a thing can be made to levitate or teleport if a lot of energy is used. 

But in Cartesian Physics, only the proper aether configuration is needed. 

We define the aether as the material of ideas, feelings, and the mind that has those ideas and feelings. In the West, Pythagoras was the first to systematize the understanding of the aether after importing the knowledge from Egypt. 

This is why he invented music theory as "do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do", to signify 7 energy states, since music directly manipulates the aether. This matches the 7 colors in the spectrum as R-O-Y-G-B-I-V.

We experience this when we are sad and get uplifted by happy music. Thus, music can lead to a state-change in the aethereal mind.  

This is why Socrates said that the Pythagoreans often stuck their ears onto things to discover the aether configuration in that thing. But he says that that was the wrong technique to begin with. 

Bohr seems to understand the aether effects on electromagnetism, as quantum mechanics. But he does not seem to discover how to manipulate the aether. 

In fact, only 3 human civilizations have exhibited proof of the knowledge of how to tap the aether: 

1. Ancient Egyptians
2. Hindus
3. Chinese

The Egyptians show this in their pyramid construction. The Hindus show this as levitating monks. The Chinese show this as 'chi'. 

The proper understanding of how to manipulate the aether will lead to spacetime technology. Such a technology can "float" mining equipment to the moon to mine precious metals there. 

These can then be floated back to earth to create better iPhones, Teslas, computers, etc. more cheaply while bringing and end to the mining on Earth that destroys essential wildlife. 

It can float plasma and reduce energy requirements in order to realize fusion just like in stars which "float" in outerspace. 

After things are floated via the aether, then humans can safely delete Einstein and Relativity from Physics as a long-running 100+ year scam that began in 1905 and has made science and technology impotent for so long. -->
