{{< q a="Kybalion" >}}
All manifested things have 2 sides, 2 aspects, 2 poles, a pair of opposites with manifold degrees between the 2 extremes.
{{< /q >}}


The polarities in the Aethereal Layer are:

Positive | Negative
--- | ---
Dharma | Adharma
Dynamism | Staticity


Note that the Physical Domain is inherently Negative. 



<!-- The constant action by the Positive and Negative Force on Substance which we call Quantum create a polarity or duality* on each substance or quantum, which then manifests as a particle or a wave. 

{{< n n="*'Duality' emphasizes the opposite-ness, while 'Polarity' emphasizes their mutual belligerence" >}}



We say that each quantum exists with a set charge or predisposition from the very beginning. This polarity is called differently in each Layer.


Layer | Positive Vortex | Negative Vortex
---- | --- | ---
Probability | Existing | Non-Existing
Aethereal | Unifying |  Divisive
Spatial | Counterclockwise Rotation | Clockwise Rotation
Radiant | Male (Positive Charge) | Female (Negative Charge)
Convertible | Left Chirality | Right Chirality  
Material | Color Charge (Matter) | Anti-Color Charge (Antimatter) -->



In the aethereal layer, this polarity is the tendency to divide versus the tendency to unite. 

- The positive manifests as "like attracting like"
- The negative manifests as "opposites repelling"

We use the following words for these poles:

Pole | Associated Words
--- | ---
Positive | Good, Unite, Peace, Cooperate, Synthesize, Understand, etc
Negative | Bad, Divide, War, Compete, Analyze, Confuse, etc


## Maya and the Aether Drag

Since the lower parts of the aethereal layer is mostly about information, we can use:
- learning, as vidya, as an example of the positive force   
  - The push towards knowledge and realization we call the aether dash
- ignorance, as maya, as an example of the negative force
  - The slowness of knowledge we call the aether drag


The Aether Dash is the speeding up of knowledge and solutions, while the Aether Drag is the slowdown of the arrival of the correct thoughts, feelings, and facts.


### How the Michelson-Morley Experiment Proved the Cartesian Aether Drag

The Michelson and Morley experiment done in 1887 tested the speed of light relative to the direction of the Earth's motion.

They revealed its speed to be 299,901 kilometers per second. This was different from Fizeau's speed which was 313,274 kilometers per second in 1849, and even more different from that of Romer 220,000 kilometers per second in 1675. 

Year | Measurer | Measurement 
--- | --- | --- 
1675 | Rømer and Huygens | 220,000
1849 | Fizeau | 315,000 
1879 | Michelson Morley | 299,901 
1983 | 17th CGPM | 299,792


This shows that the farther the measurement from the present, the less accurate it is. Therefore, **the time aspect caused a drag in the aether**.  

It follows that the more distant the times and spaces, the more drag is there in the aethereal ideas, feelings, and information. 


If 299,792 were the truth, then how fast or how slow people arrived at the truth would be an indication of "dash" or "drag". We want to avoid as much drag as possible, especially when looking for the truth.* 

{{< n n="There might be some alien species who aim for getting the truth as fast as possible just as humans want to get rich as fast as possible. i.e. they get pleasure by arriving at any truth so quickly, just as we get pleasure by seeing a bank account that is so large. (We want to upgrade the human species to seek the truth in anything instead of seeking money to buy anything)" >}}   


<!-- But this merely shows the physicists' misconception at that time. Back then, spacetime was not seen as a single idea. And so the measurement was done at the same timespan. Even when the experiment was repeated at another time, it was still done within the same timespan.  

But **the aether is the medium of space and time, and of reality itself**. And so the proper way to measure it is to **compare light (one of its effects) at very distant times, the farther the better**.  -->

This is similar to measuring land by the speed of 2 cars running over it. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/aether.jpg" a="Aether drag" >}}

Measuring the speed of 2 cars at a short distance gives you very little data on the features of the land.  But if you let the cars run far, then you can get an idea of the features of the land, such as how one car is dragged by the terrain but not another. 


### Two Ways to Test Aether Drag

According to our 5 Elements model, electromagnetism is inside spacetime and spacetime is inside the aether. This means there are 2 ways to test the aether drag: 
- by time: Measurements can be done on a thing at distant times at the same place
- by space: Measurements can be done on the same thing at distant places at the same time

The Michelson-Morley measurement done on earth can be compared with current and very old experiments, also done on earth, in order to reveal the aether drag. 

Another option is to test the speed of light on earth and on another star or galaxy at the same time. This will likewise reveal differences in measurement. The farther the distance, the larger the difference. 

In the case of testing at the same place, the speed of light shows less difference with modern measurements from the 18th century ones. The idea of the speed of light has evolved from 301,000 kilometers per second in 1729, to 299,796 thanks to the Michelson-Morley experiment. 

This reveals:
- 'High and low level' aether drag
- The reduction of the drag through time -- this matches the acceleration of the expansion of spacetime as measured by the Hubble and James Web Telescopes 



### High and Low Level Aether Drag

The Michelson Morley experiment therefore disproved the Fresnel aether, but proved the Cartesian aether drag and the Huygens aether (as the 2nd Element or most3).

 <!-- drag or the fact that space (sost3 in Superphysics) is directional. Instead, space is "invariant".  -->

<!-- We can say that while aether drag slows down the aether, aether dash speeds it up. -->

 <!-- a test of a way to measure the speed of light. It is not a test of the aether itself, though it can test the aether indirectly by testing the speeds of light at different times.  -->


The image above shows that the aether drag has always been there. We call the large differences as "high-level aether drag", and tiny differences as "low-level aether drag". 

- High-level aether drag leads to huge amounts of ignorance. 
  - An example is a caveman not knowing how to create the internet. 
- High-level aether dash leads to huge amounts of knowledge.
  - An example is a genius like Newton or the Buddha who discovers Physics and Buddhism.
- Low-level aether drag leads to tiny amounts of ignorance. 
  - An example is solving a math problem that does not add up
- Low-level aether dash leads to tiny amounts of knowledge. 
  - An example is a software programmer solving a bug

The data scientist will deal with the low-level aether drag for use in technological applications.
- The metaphysician will deal with high-level aether drag for guidance

These will add quality control to aether science and prevent junk theorists like Kant and Einstein from destroying and corrupting it with transcendence and simultaneity respectively. 

Instead, the metaphysician will use the spacetime definition of Avicenna, Hume, and Poincare to guide the data scientist in developing space-time tech and aether tech that are rooted in reality instead of imagination.
- Examples of space-time tech are levitation, teleportation, and time travel
- An example of aether tech is artificial sentience


<!-- Since the aether is the medium of reality, then it unifies not only all physics (Newtonian, pre-Newtonian, Asian, Quantum, etc), but also all the sciences. It only avoids non-real knowledge such as religion, myths, and fiction. Such myths might be real in other multiverses, but not ours.  -->

## The Aether Dash

The aether explains all real movements, not only physical ones, but also the movements of ideas and feelings. Examples are:
- the movement of Russia-Ukraine from peace to war
- the movement or evolution of the idea of a horse-drawn carriage into an automobile, and then into an hybrid electric car, and then into an electric flying car in the future
- the movement of stock prices
- the movement of fashion trends and why some trends stay, while some die out

Knowing how the aether moves everything will let us move things into the peaceful, happy reality very different from the current reality, ignorant of the aether, filled with war, pandemics, and crises. 

For example:
- instead of fighting over limited resources and real estate here on Earth, spacetime tech can allow interstellar travel where resources and planet-land are inexhaustible
- instead of creating conflict between Ukraine and Russia, constitutional virtues and multilateral clearing can be used to find a common ground between liberal economies and centrally-controlled economies
- instead of doing nothing against global warming, the concept of investing and operating in commercially non-viable, but morally viable, ventures can be introduced in order to prevent the bigger loss from climate change that hurts everyone's investments

This movement out of darkness into bright positivity is called the aether dash.
