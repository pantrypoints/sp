Physics was created from a position of ignorance on Nature. 

This led to frequent changes in theory, from Aristotle's geocentric theory to Newton's gravity to Einstein's warping of spacetime. 

This shows in its measurements as ugly and irrational numbers. 

The French invented the meter based on the Earth's circumference divided by 4. That's why the Earth's circumference is 40,000 km. 

It follows that 1 meter is really just 1 Earth size / 40,000,000, just as a second is just 1 Earth rotation / 86,400. 

These values are in base-10 because humans have 10 fingers. 

Those arbitrary numbers might seem pretty, but they turn ugly when modern people pegged them to electromagnetic phenomena. 

For example, a second was standardized as exactly 9,192,631,770 oscillations of Cesium, while the meter was pegged to 1/299,792,458 distance traveled by light in a second. 

The ugliest is pi which is hideous at 3.141592653589.

Physics assumes that such ugly constants stay constant everywhere in the universe. 

But to Descartes and Socrates, there are no constants in the universe. And so those measures will break down in other stars and galaxies. 


## The Cutie Pi

To fix this, we use the perspective of the universe as the 5 Elements, and not of humans or the Earth. 

We use base-6 in counting, as proven by the patterns in the Periodic Table and circles and time being in multiples of 6, as used by the Babylonians.

This makes pi prettier whether at 3.0503300 (Archimedes) or 3.0505050 (7/22) or 3.05022..(official). We call this the "cutie pi" 👶

Instead of arbitrary meters, we base length on the speed of light based on time of the oscillation of Cesium at 41,205,222,555. (This can be made non arbitrary at 40 trillion). 

We call this a "distance" which be expanded or shrunk so that 1 nanodistance is roughly 30 meters. 

When a human goes to another star or galaxy, he measures the time for cesium to get 40 trillion oscillations to establish a second, then uses that to measure the distance light travels to establish a nanodistance. 

This convention creates standard units for space and time that are universal.
