While the aetherspace (mos2) is tasked with separating identities, virtual space particles (mos3) are tasked with facilitating movement between those aetherspaces. 

This means that all forces come from the spatial layer:
- contact forces come from the aetherspace
- gravitational movement comes from the spacetime, as virtual space particles. 

<!-- All gravity and spatial effects are facilitated by the media of the spatial layer. -->


## Simplification of Gravity Effects

This lets us reduce the number of concepts to the following:

Material Superphysics | Physics
--- | ---
Material Gravity | Newtonian Gravity
Material Gravity | Coulomb's Law
Material Gravity | Inverse Square Law
Fine Gravity | Van der Waals Force
Fine Gravity | Surface Tension
Fine Gravity | Dzhanibekov Effect
Rotational Gravity | Dark Matter 
Rotational Gravity | Einstein's warping of Spacetime
Aetherspace Expansion-Contraction | Dark Energy
Aetherspace | Strong Force
Liquid Nature of Space Particles | Gravitational Waves
Liquid Nature of Space Particles | Equivalence and Weak Equivalence Principles


In a nutshell, this gives us 3 matter-gravities:

1. Material 
2. Fine
3. Rotational or Vortex

This is different from radiant-gravities as magnetism, and aetherspace-gravities as inter/intramolecular and contat forces and strong force 

Physics usually calls:
- radiant-gravities as forces such as magnetic force 
- aetherspace-gravities as bonds such as the hydrogen bond



## Rotational Gravity: How Vortices Form in Space

Vortices form when there are energetic space particles caused by an increase in aether in a location.

An easy analogy is a hurricane which is formed from the invisible hot air.

The eye is where the hottest part of the air that gets a spin from the heat (agitation) that then affects the cooler air around it.

This makes the air spin around it. 

The eye only becomes visible when there is so much air clumping and spinning with it. 

But materialists accept only what they can see. 

And so they think that the cause of a hurricane is the visible clouds around eye, and the cause of a galaxy is the visible mass around its vortex.

Newtonian Physics bases its principles on material effects. 

Cartesian Physics bases its principles on aethreal causes. 

It is more solid to create a science based on causes instead of effects.



## Replacing Inertial Mass and Gravitational Mass with Rotational and Material Gravity

Physics began with Newton who did not have the concept of invisible space particles. 

And so he could only base his dyanmics on visible matter. This led to the his theory of matter-based gravity which we call material gravity. 

He used the simplistic concept of inertia to explain rotational gravity since he had no concept of spinning vortices which requires the concept of the 2 Forces. 


Einstein discovered Rotational or Vortex Gravity by adopting Mach's Principle.
