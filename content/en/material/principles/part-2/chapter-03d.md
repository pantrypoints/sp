Superphysics is derived from Cartesian Physics which has 2 domains of reality: 

1. Physical -- this is 'body'
2. Metaphysical -- this is 'mind'

These are known as mind-body duality. 

Since there are 2 realities then there are 2 space-times:

1. Physical spacetime -- Physics knows this already
2. Aetherspace -- this connects to the 5th Element as akasha


These 2 space-times lead to [2 types of motion](/research/descartes/philosophy/part-2/article-24/), which is really just a kind of change:

1. Gradual or Sequential or Local Motion or Change

Local motion is sequential motion. This is seen as a ball rolling down a hill in a sequence. This is also called relativistic motion as it is rolling relative to the ground.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Book 2, Article 24" >}}
There is only local motion*. Local motion is the action by which a body migrates from one place to another. The same body changes place [from one perspective] and does not change place [from another perspective] at the same time.

This leads to Cartesian Relativity. 


2. Sudden or Teleportative or sTrue Motion

This is sudden or arbitrary motion. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Book 2, Article 24" >}}
True motion is THE TRANSLATION OF A WHOLE BODY (with its particles) FROM THE VICINITY OF THOSE BODIES AT REST THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH IT, to the vicinity of other bodies. The body might consist of many particles which have other motions within themselves. True motion is a translation, not a force or action that transfers. Therefore, true motion is always in the moving object, not in the mover.

Local or gradual motion of a thing depends on the things around it. 
- This is relativistic motion

True or sudden motion depends on the Action of the thing itself. 
- This is now known as spooky action at a distance

This is seen as UFOs teleporting from Point A to Point B, or in our dreams where we switch from one scene to another instantly. 

More recently, this has been proven as teleportation of quantum particles. 

<!-- In both local and true motion, there is change in state, which was called Action by  -->

Maupertuis, who was a student of Bernoulli who was a Cartesian, revived the Cartesian Action until it was taken up by Feynman to explain path integrals. 

Newton's mechanics has no concept of metaphysics and so his Physics likewise has no concept of true motion. 

Euler on the other hand was a Cartesian and so his mechanics allows teleportation, which he calls miracle. 


{{< q a="Euler" c="Mechanica, Proposition 1. Theorem" >}}
If the body were suddenly able to arrive at the final place from the starting place, it would be necessary for the body to be annihilated at the first place and suddenly produced in the final place. This cannot be done according to the laws of nature, except by agreeing to a miracle.

This is why Cartesian Physics had Classical and Quantum unified from the start:

- spacetime facilitates local motion and classical Physics
- the aetherspace facilitates true motion and quantum Physics
