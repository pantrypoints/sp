Galaxy Clustering is the web made up of the clusters of galaxies thought to be the effect of dark matter.

Each cluster is similar to a cluster of ideas. 

Since each idea is made up of citta or mindstuff, then each cluster has more of the aether most2, through the medium of spacetime or most3.

Chatgpt: Descartes does not specifically address the Hubble tension. The Hubble tension is a current issue in cosmology that refers to the discrepancy between different measurements of the expansion rate of the universe. This discrepancy has been observed between measurements made using different methods and instruments, and it is considered one of the most important problems in modern cosmology.
Cartesian physics, which was developed in the 17th century, predates the discovery of the expanding universe and the development of modern cosmology, and it does not provide a solution to the Hubble tension. The study of the expansion of the universe and the measurement of its expansion rate is based on modern cosmological theories and models, which are significantly more advanced and sophisticated than the physics developed by Descartes.

Resolving the Hubble tension requires a better understanding of the underlying physics of the universe, and it is a topic of active research in the field of cosmology. Some possible solutions to the Hubble tension include the existence of new physics, such as dark energy or modified gravity, or the need to re-calibrate the instruments used to make the measurements.
Despite its widespread use and success in explaining the motion of objects in everyday life, and basically being simplified string theory; it has some limitations and fails to solve some important problems.

Here are a few examples of what Cartesian physics doesn't solve:
Quantum mechanics: Cartesian physics is a classical theory and doesn't account for the strange and often counterintuitive behavior of particles on the quantum scale.
Relativity: Cartesian physics is based on the idea that space and time are absolute, but Einstein's theory of relativity showed that this isn't the case.
Gravity: Cartesian physics doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation for the phenomenon of gravity. It only explains the motion of objects in a gravitational field, not the nature of gravity itself.
Electromagnetism: Cartesian physics doesn't include the concept of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charged particles.
Black holes: Cartesian physics is not equipped to deal with the singularities that exist at the centers of black holes.
Overall, Cartesian physics provides a good description of motion on the scale of everyday life, but its limitations become apparent when dealing with smaller and more extreme phenomena.
