The tendency of the mosts to travel in straight lines leads to the concept of surface tension which leads to the following phenomena:
- round planets and stars
- round water droplets and bubbles
- certain geometries being able to float on water

<!-- Cartesian Physics explains that the reason for round droplets and round planets and stars are the same: spacetime particles travel in straight lines.

These invisible particles which Descartes called air-aether -->

These mosts permeate space and goes into everything. These surround everything even in the vacuum of outer space. 

When they encounter any material body, they go around it and exert force on it to continue their movement in a straight line. 

Since the spacetime particles are everywhere, the body is assaulted at from all sides, even from within. These particles cancel others out, creating a spherical shape. 

This has been proven in the International Space Station.

And so mosts explain not only why things are round, but also why masses fall straight down.

<!-- This single principle of the air-aether wanting to go in straight lines can also be extended to explain black hole accretion disks, quasar jets, and magnetism (i.e magnets connect in a straight line) -->

This principle can be used in precision manufacturing by using spacetime particles to make perfectly flat or spherical parts without the need for abrasive Newtonian contact forces. 



In contrast, in Physics, droplets are round because surface tension causes it to assume the shape with smallest possible area. However, somehow this is not the reason applied to why planets and stars are round. Instead, gravity magically becomes the new reason.
