Chapter 4 explained that the main substance of the Spatial layer is the rotating vortex commonly known as black holes or quasars. 

These black holes are made up of quanta called quanta of spacetime (qost) as invisible space particles. These are the 2nd Element in Cartesian Physics.


Qost |  Examples
--- | ---
Universal | Universes
Galactic | Galacies and Quasars
Stellar | Stars and Planets


- The gaps between qosts manifest as the Planck length. 
- The change between them are Planck time.

<!-- This leads to:
- Galactic gravity from a rotating qost1
- Stellar or Planetary gravity from a rotating qost2
- Centrifugal and centripetal forces from a rotating material object qost3 -->

<!-- ### Why are Galaxies both Qost and Qots?

We refer to galaxies as qosts when their nature is confined to a single universe or reality.

We refer to them as qots when their nature is compared to those of other universes or realities. 

Since the current sciences have no knowledge of the properties of other universes or realities, then we will refer to them as qosts. But after humans learn how to teleport to other galaxies then they will be referred to as qots.    

Like qoas (monads), qosts are above the Radiant Layer (Electromagnetism). This makes them likewise invisible and not tangible. For example, you see that there is a space between you and your desk, but you cannot see the properties of that space.

In ancient natural philosophy, this was called the metaphysical 'Air' Element that filled all of physical existence, preventing any Void in Nature.  -->


## Properties of Qosts

Like the aethereal layer, the spatial layer above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch. This is why qosts are not visible nor tangible.

Unlike the matter of the Material Layer, qosts are easily divisible, giving them fluid and wave-properties. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Part 2 Article 25" >}}
People attribute fluidity to the heavens.. All fluids do not resist the motions of other bodies only when the fluids are themselves are also in motion. 
{{< /q >}}


Both qosts and mosts are made up of 4 aether particles that are flat, except for aetherspace particles which are linear and not flat. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/space.jpg" a="Spatial Shapes" c="The Spatial Layer particles have 4 aether particles" >}}


Qosts are speed changers while Mosts are shape changers:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia, Part 2, Article 35" >}}
There might be 2 kinds of particles:
1. Shape-changers bend themselves in various ways and change their shapes.
2. Speed-changers change their speed to occupy space accurately. These 2 jointly fit together and occupy all the space.
{{< /q >}}


Since there is nothing static in the spatial layer, then a most3 (gravity) can convert to qosts and vice versa. All that is needed is an external cause, whether a disturbance from:
- the aether that forms a vortex, or 
- matter that displaces contiguous space particles


## Detection of Qosts

The properties of qosts are detected through the reaction of the lower layers to it. This can be done through passive observation.

<!-- :
- the upper aethereal layer as the changing of ideas through time and space  
- the lower layers as the reaction of light and material particles --> 

For example, we know that there is a black hole (spatial vortex) in the center of our galaxy because of how the visible radiant stars go around it. 
- Here, the Radiant Layer exposes a stellar qost of the Spatial Layer

Likewise, you see the space between you and the desk because of the existence of your material body and the material desk.
- Here, the Material Layer exposes the qosts around you. 

Another example is the rotation of material objects around their axis, like a top or gyroscope. This makes it seem to defy gravity by standing upright.  


<!-- From these, we can plainly see that the qosts around our table is very different from those in the supermassive black hole of a galaxy. 

In planets, a planetary qost is detected by the behavior of mass around it. 

The qost of a heavenly body in Physics is the Schwarzschild Radius of that body. For example, a galaxy's qost is the event horizon of its supermassive black hole. 

The qost of a planet such as the Earth is the Schwarzschild Radius of the Earth which is 1 centimeter, while that of the sun is 3 kilometers.
-->

<!-- ## Detection of Qots'

The properties of qots' are detected through the reaction of the body itself (the one with the qots). This can also be done by passive observation. 

However, the best method is to do active observation through probing.
