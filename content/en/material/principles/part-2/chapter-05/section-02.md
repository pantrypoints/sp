Galactic qosts manifest as either galaxies or quasars.


Qost | Rotation | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
Galaxy | Anticlockwise | Convert energy into matter
Quasar |  Clockwise  | Convert matter back to energy

Galaxies convert energy into matter, as stars and planets, just as quasars convert matter back into energy. 
- This prevents the universe from having a thermal death. 


### Galaxies

The structure of a galaxy depends on the rotation and energy of its vortex. 

According to Descartes, a galaxy forms when mosts (which he calls the 2nd Element) collide with other mosts to form vortices which we call sos'. 
- The weaker and smaller ones revolve around the larger and stronger ones. 
- These larger ones are naturally separated by their mutual repulsion from the need to retain their uniqueness.  

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
At the beginning, God placed every sort of inequality among these particles. They had all sorts of sizes, shapes, and dispositions to move or not to move, in all ways and in all directions. But that does not prevent them afterwards from having been rendered almost all fairly equal, especially those that remained an equal distance from the centers around which they were turning.

Thus, in a short time, all the parts were arranged in order. Each became more or less distant from the center around which it had taken its course, according as it was more or less large and agitated compared to the others.

These vortices swirl as galaxies, just as cold and warm air create typhoons and tornadoes.
- The more warm air is present, the stronger the typhoon becomes. 
- Likewise, the more Positive aether is behind the compiled ideas for a galaxy, the larger its area of influence, when it turns into a spiral galaxy.

Type | Age | Size
--- | --- | ---
Irregular | Young | Small
Spiral | Medium | Medium
Lenticular | Medium | Medium
Elliptical | Old | Large


A galaxy is therefore created in the following steps:

1. The Supreme has an idea for a universe
2. The Aether gets the ideas for that universe, packages them as organized ideas (qoa) for distribtion to spacetime (spatial layer)
3. Galactic mosts and sos emerge in the spatial layer as irregular galaxies. These repel each other to create space
4. The positive aether acts on the galactic sos to create smaller vortices, as stellar qosts
 <!-- increase its area of influence and size to create spiral galaxies -->
5. Stellar qosts emerge within this area to convert energy into matter which are then spread via supernovae, and life through their Positive Force (Living energy is in the spatial Air Element)
6. The galactic qost runs out of ideas (and feelings), leaving its stars behind as globular clusters. 
<!-- It turns into either empty space or a quasar -->
7. The stars die and become pure space


<!-- 1. Spiral galaxies

These are the most common type, making up around 75% of all galaxies. These are flat, rotating disks containing stars, gas and dust, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge.  -->

<!-- These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars, many of which reside in globular clusters. -->

<!-- This has a subclass called barred spiral galaxy of which the Milky Way is a part of. -->

<!-- Barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. Bars are found in about half of all spiral galaxies. Bars generally affect both the motions of stars and interstellar gas within spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms as well.  -->

<!-- 2. Lenticular galaxy an intermediate between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy. It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation.

3. Elliptical galaxies are the largest kind and have an ellipsoidal shape. Most are composed of older, low-mass stars, with a sparse interstellar medium and minimal star formation activity. They tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters.

4. Irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct shape -->



<!-- The friction of those invisible spacetime particles creates visible photon sparks (mor1) that travel through spacetime.

Those photons then fizzle out, merging back with faraway spacetime particles (most3), spreading energy everywhere. 

This everywhere-energy then energizes that spacetime until certain areas have more energy than others. 

This imbalance creates new vortices (as traffic jams for most3), similar to how high-low air pressure creates hurricanes from nowhere.

Those new vortices form new galaxies as long as there is enough latent energy in that spacetime area. -->


As you can see, galaxies produce solid matter as planets through their stars. In time, this would cause the universe to have more matter and so lose energy. 


## Quasars are Reverse Vortices


To prevent this, some qosts rotate in the opposite direction as quasars. This converts matter back into energy, reversing the process. 

<!-- Thus, spacetime can convert itself to photons then convert back to spacetime, conserving energy. 

But the creation of matter means that more energy is crudified as time passes. This means that the universe should lose energy as it ages, just like adding flour to a glass of water will make it solid eventually, since flour is solid. 

So why is the universe still energetic? -->


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/quasar.jpg" alt="Quasars as reverse vortices" cap="In Cartesian Physics, quasars as reverse vortices" >}}


<!-- This is because stars and planets rotate in a clockwise motion.  -->

<!-- These turn in the opposite direction than the rest, let's say clockwise when others turn counterclockwise.  -->

When a large powerful clockwise vortex touches a small anticlockwise vortex, the latter does not go with the former, as in a galaxy.

Instead it stays in stasis around the large vortex similar to 2 gears staying at the same spot. 

Other particles join in, creating large stasis similar to a traffic jam. 

In time, more particles get snagged in this traffic jam, leading to a pileup that compresses the particles sequentially like a meatgrinder. 

This leads to friction that creates much more light than a galaxy.

In time, matter as planets, asteroids, comets etc get snagged, crushed and spit out back as light and energy to be sent far away.

This de-crudifies energy and re-energizes the universe.

It follows that that the ratio of galaxies and quasars should be roughly similar. It means that some bright galaxies should be reclassified as quasars. 

These may be elliptical like normal galaxies but are distinguished by the lack of arms or distinctive features because of the difference of the motion of the parts and the center. 

<!-- ## Antimatter as Reverse Vortices in the Radiant, Convertible, and Material Layers

These reverse vortices in the material Element (earth-aether) manifest as anti-matter, such as anti-proton and anti-hydrogen. 

These convert visible (counterclockwise) matter vortices back into invisible spacetime particles upon contact. 

The opposite rotations lead to friction, creating photons until both particles fizzle out and convert to spacetime, as consistency of Cartesian principles in macro and micro.

These principles mean that antimatter can be created more cheaply by changing the vortex rotation called charge directly using far less energy. -->

<!-- Unlike evil Einstein who used Physics to promote nuclear bombs, Cartesians have a higher moral and intellectual standard and will not use vortex science to make antimatter weapons to vaporize enemies back into spacetime particles. 

In fact, Cartesian Physics can delete ALL of Einstein's principles and replace them with Lorentz Relativity in Poincare spacetime, using aethereal vortices to explain both macro and micro.
