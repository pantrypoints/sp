Each of the 5 Layers implements a Conservation Law in order to maintain the balance in the universe.

The Conservation Law for the Spatial Layer is the Conservation of Momentum.
- This states that total momentum of a system remains constant when no external forces act on the system. 


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 13" >}}
A body that 'tends' towards some direction does not mean that there is a thought or desire inside the body that carries it there. Instead, it means that it is **disposed** to move there and that there is something **preventing** it.

The Law of Conservation of Idea in Physical Reality  | This leads to the Theory of Dynamism as the Rules of Movement
{{< /dc >}} -->

The Law of Conservation of Momentum is implemented by the Rules of Motion.

<!-- come from Cartesian-Spinozan Physics. These are rules coming from the 
 -Energy-Mass, which we collectively call the Law of Conservation of Idea.  -->

## Rule 1: No Void

**No body moves into the place of another body unless at the same time that other body moves into the place of another body.**

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule1.jpg" a="No Void" >}}


This is based on the maxim that there is no Void in Nature. This means that every space in existence, whether physical or metaphysics, is filled up. 
- In the physical domain, it is filled with virtual particles such as virtual photons

This rule is the basis for:
- Virtual particles filling "empty" space
- Gravity pushing object down objects 

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The History of Astronomy" >}}
According to Descartes, through an eternal revolution from rest to motion and motion to rest, the amount of motion in the universe was always the same. But there was no void. 

No part of matter could be moved without thrusting some other out of its place. The matter which any body pushed before it, rolled immediately backwards, to supply the place of that matter which flowed in behind it. 

This is similar to the swimming of a fish. The water, which it pushes before it, immediately rolls backwards, to supply the place of what flows in. It thus forms a vortex around the body of the fish. In the same way, the motion originally impressed by the Creator on matter produced in it an infinity of vortices, or circular streams.

This is in Part 2, Proposition 7 of Spinoza's Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, and inferred from Principia, Part 2, Article 33
{{< /dc >}}



## Rule 2: Straight or Circle

**Every moving identity moves in a straight line when alone, and in a curve or a circle when moving with others. When in a circle, it moves away from the center.**

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule2.jpg" a="Straight or Circular" >}}

This is angular momentum and centrifugal force which is really straight-line motion confined.

This rule is the basis for:
- Gravity following the inverse square law
- Planetary orbits and galaxy rotation curves

{{< dc t="Note" >}}
This is in Part 2, Article 39 of Descartes' Principia Philosophia and Part 2, Propositions 15-17 of Spinoza's Principles of Cartesian Philosophy
{{< /dc >}}


## Rule 3: Collisions

When a weaker identity hits a stronger, it will be deflected. When a stronger hits a weaker, it will transfer some of its force to the weaker.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule3.jpg" a="Collisions" >}}

<!-- **If a weak body moving in a straight line hits a stronger body, then the weak body will be deflected, retaining its motion but losing its direction. But if strong were moving and hits weak, the strong will move the weak with it. The strong will lose as much of its own motion as it gives to the weak.** -->

{{< dc t="Note" >}}
This is in Part 2, Article 40 of Descartes' Principia Philosophia and Part 2, Proposition 20 of Spinoza's Principles of Cartesian Philosophy
{{< /dc >}}


This rule is the basis for:
- Nuclear fission and fusion
- Chemical reactions


## Rule 4: State Continuity

**Each identity remains as much as it can always in the same state. It is never changed except by external causes.**

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule4.jpg" a="State" >}}

This absorbs Newton's First Law of Classical Mechanics while making it consistent with Quantum Mechanics.

This rule is the basis for:
- Photons going continuously forward
- Quantum superposition being predicatble by Cartesian Relativity 
- Line spectra being emitted by electrons

{{< dc t="Note" >}}
This is in Part 2, Article 37 of Descartes' Principia Philosophia and Part 2, Proposition 14 of Spinoza's Principles of Cartesian Philosophy

## Newton's Laws Versus Descartes' Rules

We compare the the principles of Newton and Descartes regarding motion:

Newton | Descartes
--- | ---
Law 1: Inertia | Rule 2: State Continuity
Law 2: Force | Rule 1: No Void
Law 3: Action-Reaction | Rule 4: Collisions


The main difference is that Descartes' is based on quantum or aethereal movement, while Newton's is based on material movement. 

The problem with Newton's system is that material principles cannot be extedned to aethereal phenomena, aethereal principles can be extended down to material phenomena.  

<!-- Every motion in itself is straight. Things which move together eventually move in a circular manner, always tending to move away from the center of the circle which they describe. -->

<!-- This matches Newton's Third Law. -->


<!-- The Law of Conservation of Idea of Superphysics leads to the idea of unique gravitational signatures in each identity which must be maintained. The interaction of these signatures leads to the movement of each identity as it is attracted or combined or is repulsed or evicted by other identities. 

The principles of the resulting movements can be summarized into three rules, as explained by Rene Descartes. Instead of Newton's Laws, we use Descartes' Rules as they are consistent not only with Classical and Quantum Mechanics, but also with the Biology, Medicine, Sociology, Economics, and other sciences.     -->


<!-- This leads to angular momentum and the path integrals of Quantum Mechanics.

![rule 3](/covers/rule3.jpg)

Newton was unable to think of probabilistic paths because he ascribed the cause of movement to matter. This led him to believe that gravity was a pulling force which did not necessitate different paths.

In reality, gravity is pushing force from the invisible aether that directs things towards mass.

Rule 3 is important because, when combined with Rule 1, it has Poincare's Law of Relativity baked in, which we call as Aethereal Relationality. This is to avoid the word 'Relativity' in search engines.  

Rule 3 leads to gravitational lensing and wave-particle duality. This also removes the need for Einstein's fabric, tensors, and `c`. It restores gravity as a force and demotes spacetime as an illusory effect of gravitation instead of being its cause. -->


<!-- Superhysics uses the 3 Rules of Movement from Descartes instead of the Law of Motion from Isaac Newton. This is because Newton's laws are already included in the Rules of Descartes.   -->
