Chapter 5 gave 3 qost types. Here, we match them to their spatial territories or the space around each type:

<!-- Atom | Nucleaon | Inner Shells | Outer Shells |  

galaxy as society of stars  -->

Qost | Concept
--- | --- 
Star or Planet | Stellar or Planetary Territory
Galaxy |  Galactic Territory 
Universe | Universal Territory


Each space or territory has a lot of unique phenomena. We list the most common ones here.


## Planetary and Stellar Territories

### Stellar Gravitational Territories

The Chapter 3e on mosts explained Material Gravity which is caused by the displacement of stellar qosts whcih then turns them into mosts. Such mosts do not have a vortex and so have no proper gravitational field. 

However, a star has a vortex and this gives it such a field. 

The vortex gives field dynamnics that are useful to Material Superphysics.

1. Edge or Halo

Friction from neighboring stellar territories creates light and heat around the edges of a stellar system. 



### Planetary Gravitational Territories

Planets are stellar vortices that failed to get the needed qosts and energy to become stars. 

1. Escape Velocity 

This is the speed needed for an object to escape the gravity of its planet


2. Equivalence Principle 

The mosts are displaced equally from surface of the planet. This is why bodies fall at the same speed when dropped from the same altitude. 


3. Magnetic Fields

The vortex rotation creates a channel that lets mor2's pass through, creating a magnetic field.

The mosts that come from the vortex drag down matter back to the center at `9.81` meters per second at sea level regardless of their mass.

This is like floodwaters dragging large and small objects at the same speed. 

Unlike Einstein who makes a difference between inertial and gravitational mass, Descartes unifies both as the force of spacetime. 

This simplifies Physics and explains gravity, dark matter, and dark energy from a single principle.




## Galactic Territories

These are the areas occupied by galaxies and quasars.

1. Edge or Halo

Friction from neighboring galaxies creates light and heat around the edges of a stellar system. 


2. Magnetic Fields

Rotating galaxies and quasars have channels that create a magnetic field.




## Universal Territories

This is the areas occupied by a universe and is indefinite in size because its area is dictated by the mind that observes that universe,

This is connected to the strata of Bio Superphysics. 


### Clusters and Superclusters

Galaxies that form within clusters:
- are different from those that form outside of clusters. 
- have less expansion speed that the rest of the universe



### Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs)
