<!-- In 1644, Descartes established a complete theory of gravity, saying that objects revolve around the sun at varying speeds based on their location or distance from the center vortex, represented by the sun. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rotation2.jpg" a="Rotation" >}}

- The closest planets like Mercury revolved fast.
- The outer planets like Jupiter revolved slower.
- But the farthest objects revolved the fastest.

Each vortex is different from each other and so everything is relative depending on which vortex you use as the basis for measurement.

Newton debunks this in his Principia in 1685, saying that planets revolve according to their inertia and not their location. 

This was validated when the outer planets were discovered. And so Descartes' theory was abandoned forever. 


### Dark Matter and Dark Energy are Not Needed

But in 1933, Fritz Zwicky found that the outer parts of galaxies revolve faster than the inner parts, violating Newton. This led to the invention of dark matter to keep it within Newton's laws. 

But this really vindicated Descartes' gravity -- a supermassive blackhole is the best representation of a Cartesian vortex. 

The speed of the outer parts is accounted for by the center of the vortex and not by any dark matter. 

To put icing on the gravity-cake, the DESI telescopes, meant to measure dark energy, see that speed of the universe's expansion measured through red-shift varies depending on which galaxy-cluster you look.

And so in Cartesian Physics, there is no need for either dark matter or dark energy. 

- Dark matter is an effect of the central vortex. 
- Dark energy is an effect of clusters of vortices relative to each other. ### The Mechanism for Expansion --> 


Material Superphysics explains the large scale phenomena of the universe through the 2 sublayers of the Spatial Layer:

1. Spacetime

Unlike the Minkowski spacetime of Physics which has 4 dimensions in a continuum of time, the spacetime of Material Superphysics takes the form of 2-dimensional slices that are separated by the aetherspace.


2. The Aetherspace

This is known to Physics as the Planck Length and Planck Time. 

While Dark Matter is facilitated by spacetime, Dark Energy is facilitated by the aetherspace.



## Expansion from the Aetherspace Splitting Up Spacetime

In Modern Physics, the expansion of the universe is seen through the red shift measured from distant galaxies. This acts like a doppler effect that shows that those galaxies are moving away.

The Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes measure this with a few galaxies. But specialized telescopes such as DESI measure the red shift from many galaxies for a long time.

This lets them get a bigger data set for the expansion. They found that that the expansion varies and depends on which galaxy cluster you look.

We explain that this is because the mechanism for expansion is in the aetherspace, the same layer that creates spatial vortices called black holes.

The expansion of the universe is dependent on the aethereal mind that observes that universe, being of the same substance as the mechanism of expansion. 

- In the prehistoric period, cavemen looked at the stars and saw no expansion
- In the age of telescopes, humans looked at the stars and saw expansion. 
- In the age of space telescopes, humans looked at the stars and saw accelerated expansion.

This matches the expansion of the human mind.

- In the prehistoric period, the human mind was not expanded
- In the age of telescopes, it started expanding 
- In the age of space telescopes, it started expanding faster

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 2 Article 34" >}}
The matter which already fills space G cannot successively fill all the spaces between G and E which are infinitely smaller. Some part of that matter must adapt its shape to the countless measures of those spaces. 

To achieve this, all its innumerable particles must be separated from each other by division. This leads to the division of certain particles of matter into infinity, or indefinitely.

The abstract mind expands by "dividing" and analyzing its perceptions. This action (see Chapter 6b) is done through the aetherspace which it imposes onto spacetime.

This is because the aetherspace is 'alive' whereas spacetime is 'dead'.


{{< q a="George Berkeley" c="De Motus, Section 10" >}}
The *dead force*, or simple gravitation in a body at rest, produces no observable change and hence no effect. But impact does. Therefore, since forces are proportional to their effects, then dead force is null.

## Red Shift from Spacetime Edges Show the Expansion

The aetherspace splits up spacetime, causing space to expand while mamtter stays the same.

This phenomenon is exposed by the Radiant Layer as light that produces a red shift when a light-emitting body moves away.

In Material Superphysics, this red shift happens as the edges of the star or galaxy that is sending the light. 

A distant body has more red shift the more edges are between it and the observer.

## Dark Energy = Gluon Field

The aetherspace in large scale cosmic structures is called by Physics as Dark Energy, whereas the aetherspace in quantum phenomena is called the Gluon Field which binds quarks together in a proton.

Unlike Physics which says that contact forces come from electromagnetic repulsion, Material Superphysics says that it comes from the aetherspace of 2 bodies resisting each other.

In other words, objects cannot occupy the same space because the aetherspace prevents them.

This is why we predict that matter cannot pass through the aetherspace that is between galaxy clusters. Instead, matter needs to teleport from one spacetime to another through the aetherspace, and not linearly through spacetime.

Matter can only travel from one galaxy to another if their spacetimes meet up, such as during galaxy collisions.


<!-- We are only able to detect this size-increase not from our own planets or galaxies, but from the gaps between those galaxies where there is no matter to be increased. Descartes calls them 'superficies' (surfaces), which we rename into 'edges'. -->

<!-- These edges are traversed by photons from galaxies to ours. It is there where the photons are stretched (relative to themselves before they entered those edges or gaps) as to become red shifts. 

These edges then draw the gravitational territorial of the galaxy. This territory is where the size-increase happens internally as a single unit, **independent of other galaxies**.

This is similar to the Earth having a gravitational field or territory which keeps the Earth as a single unit. It explains why we and the atmosphere are not flung away by the rotation of the Earth.

The territory of a galaxy likewise keeps its contents as a single unit, making the size-increase uniform on its stars and matter.


### The Division of Spacetime

Descartes assures us that the rate of division of spacetime is also uniform everywhere in the universe. This then leads to the constant speed of light which travels on that spacetime. 

This means that if the rate of division were slower, then the top speed of light would also be slower.

This removes the need for any dark matter or dark energy, since the nature of the spacetime particles already accounts for those phenomena.

This also implies that the speed of light is not really decreed by spacetime, but by the aether that divides that spacetime. 

The division of spacetime is an inexhaustible source of energy which Nikola Tesla tried to tap as cosmic energy. Unlike solar power which comes from a single source as the sun, this spacetime energy is everywhere, though extremely weak.

By processing Descartes' principles, in theory, division-energy can be extracted by creating a vortex with defined edges from where the energy from spacetime division (air-aether) can be downgraded into electrical energy (fire-aether).

This downgrading has metaphysical consequences though. This is why advanced species would predictably rather use the fusion of material hydrogen as their main energy source or base load, and use spacetime-division only as a backup or starter. -->


<!-- In Cartesian Physics, the expansion is accelerating because spacetime is being divided at a constant rate. 

However, the diversity within those divisions is increasing. 

So it leads to the perception that the expansion is accelerating. 

Note that the accelerated expansion is only through the red shift in the macro scale, and conversely by length contraction by Lorentz Relativity.   -->
