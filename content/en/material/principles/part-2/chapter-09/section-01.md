Spatial Relationality via `G1 : G2` and the 3 layers leads to the following phenomena:


 <!-- (This was already explained in Chapter 3e) -->
Identity 1 | Identity 2 | Phenomena
--- | --- | --- 
Matter | Matter (vortex)  | Planetary Gravity
Matter | Radiance | Spectral lines and Lensing
Radiance | Radiance | Lensing
Galaxy | Radiance  | Dark Matter, Gravitational Waves
Galaxy | Galaxy  | Dark Energy
Galaxy | Matter | Isolation 


The differences in the layer where the identies reside in brings about various physical phenomena. The relationalities with the convertible layer lead to beta decay and will be discussed in the Part on the convertible layer. 

Currently, Einstein's Relativity is adopted by Modern Physics. This prevents it from advancing and is why Physics has been stuck.

Newton was actually the first one to popularize this with the concept of Newton's apple falling. It assumes that the cause of the fall was an external force called gravity from the Earth. But in Superphysics, the fall of the apple is caused by the G of the apple's qost or center of gravity relative to the qost of the earth. 

A bucket of water has a moving center of gravity just as a flock of birds have a changing bird-leader that controls the movement of the flock.

A leaf is blown externally by the wind. But in reality, the wind blows from its own nature which reacts in a certain way to heat. The leaf then has its own nature that agrees to being blown by the wind, as opposed to a tree trunk that comes form the same seed but has different natures relative to the wind.  -->


## Getting Rid of Relativity

Relativity has 2 kinds, represting 2 different layer relations:

Name | Layer | Phenomena
--- | --- | ---
Special Relativity | Radiant-Radiant | Lensing 
General Relativity | Radiant-Galaxy | Gravitational Waves

The main mechanism of:
- Special Relativity is the metric tensor
- General Relativity is the stress-energy tensor
  - The mechanism for the stress-energy tensor is mass-energy equivalence which is really the match between electromagnetic potential and electromagnetic energy.  


Both Special and General Relativity live in a 4D Minkowski spacetime. 


Einstein Idea | Meaning
--- | --- 
Metric Tensor | Using a speed constant as a ruler
Mass-Energy Equivalence | Basing that speed on movement from a relation to something 
Inertial Mass | Movement from inherent speed
Gravitational Mass | Movement from relation to something
Equivalence Principle | Match of movement from inherent speed and relation to something

As you can see, the whole edifice and sophistry of Relativity is based on the use of the constant speed of light in the metric tensor.


### 4D Minkowski Spacetime: The Quirk of Constants

<!-- Mapping the Space-time Continuum The Metric Tensor -->

Mathematicians love constants because they prevent answers from being wild and patternless. This then puts very broad and abstract ideas distillable into something more rigid and predictable.  

For example, `pi` is a constant that makes it easy to imagine the different sizes and versions of a circle. 
- Seeing `pi` in an equation makes the mind easily understand that it will have to do something with a circle-shape. 

So the discovery of light as a constant `c` in the late 19th century led to the idea that the universe would similarly have some kind of geometry.

Since `c` is a measure of speed, and since speed involves 3-dimensional space per time, then this makes the mathematician-turned-physicist, named Einstein, imagine a geometrical space in 3 dimensions that re-renders itself per unit of time, now called a continuum.


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity, Appendix" >}}
A four-dimensional continuum described by the co-ordinates x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , was called 'world' by Minkowski, who also termed a point-event a 'orld-point'.
{{< /q >}}


{{< n n="In Superphysics, we use the constant speed of light as guide to theorize particle shapes such as corkscrew-rods for virtual photons liquid blobs for mosts, flexing rods for neutrinos, and flipping circles for photons. These dynamics fit with modern observations as magnetic field limes, gravity waves, neutrino oscillations, and polaritzation for light respectively" >}}
 

But not all movements are linear. And so Einstein further imagines a continuum that bends arbitrarily, as differential geometry, and then imposes that onto physical reality.

In fact, another mathematician-turned-physicist Hawking has a whole book on these fanciful, arbitrary large-scale geometries just like a sci-fi writer can create a trilogy of magical universes with inevitable plot holes. 
- These plot holes must exist because the human mind is limited and so cannot possibly recreate new universes without flaws and inconsistencies. 
- The plot holes in Einstein's universe include worm holes, white holes, dark matter, and singularities which are swept under the rug.

### Metric Tensor: The Simultaneity of Time Fallacy

The flaw of using constants to create the shape of space, locking spatial reality in, is understandable error. 

<!-- In his book Relativity, Einstein proposes a strange way to find the space between an observer on Trafalgar square and a cloud above it. He takes a pole, connects it to both the cloud and Trafalgar square PERPENDICULARLY. This then, he claims, would remove the need to have a rigid Trafalgar square as basis. 

Few people seemed to notice that this method is very wasteful because it has to plot the triangle using tensors (the small arrows). It is also totally arbitrary in the sense that those small arrows can be used to create whatever shapes (in this case it was a triangle).  -->

 <!-- . It creates a kind of space (and time) that can bend or be perpendicular to anything the imagination thinks of.  -->

But in order to make the arbitrary spacetimes real, Einstein uses the speed of light -- the same c that created space -- to create time, as the simultaneity of time.

<!-- To confine this arbitrariness, Einstein uses c or light (which everyone perceives in the same way) to make measurements, as .  -->

 <!-- empirical observations (that are common to all humans) possible. This c is then balanced by a cosmological constant as the medium or arena for the c. -->

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity, Chapter 8" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time. **If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous [happen at the same time]** You object by saying that "time" would only be "simultaneity" if light travels at a constant speed but the speed of light is measured by time. **You would say this is reasoning in a circle and therefore, simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light.**
{{< /q >}}


This limits temporal movement to the speed of light. While the continuum makes arbitrary space-shapes, the simultaneity of time limits the changing of spacetime.

- The continuum prevents levitation
- The simultaneity prevents easier teleportation and time travel


This then creates a universe locked-in by the radiant layer just as the Ptolemy's concentric spheres locked in the geocentric universe around the Earth. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/traf.png" alt="Einstein's Trafalgar Square" cap="Einstein applies geometries onto space itself. In constrast, we apply geometries directly onto identities, as the 5 Platonic shapes" >}}


<!-- These are used to plug the holes and differences between the imagination and the actual universe. This is similar to Aristotle and  around the Earth. -->

<!-- No one seemed to ask how would Einstein's system work in total darkness. How would a blind man erect a pole to a cloud that he couldn't see? -->
