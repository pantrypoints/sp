The Medium of Radiance facilitates the dynamics of the radiant layer.


<!-- Physics Name | Superphysics Name | Force | Requirements | Examples
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---  
Photon | mor1 | Light |  | Glass, Still Water
Heat | mor2 | Heat | Large channels for agitation | Hot plasma, Cold Ice
Virtual Photons | mor3 | Magnetism | Tiny straight channels | Magnets, Superconductors -->



<!-- Unlike Physics which treats plasma as a fourth state of matter, Superphysics treats it as non-material in the sense that it has no Strong Force  -->

### The Forces from the Radiant Media

The media of the spatial layer create the various radiant forces:

Sublayer | Media | Force | Requirements
--- | --- | --- | ---
Upper | Photons mor1 | Light | 2D wide continuous channels 
Middle | Virtual Photons mor2 | Magnetism | Straight channels
Lower | Heat mor3 | Heat | Large channels



## Light

Light is the most obvious and important force of Radiance. It travels in straight lines but can be bent by space or matter, or reflected by matter.

### Polarization 

<!-- Mor1s are made up of 2-dimensional aether particles. This allows it to be channeled into a single angle, as polarization. -->

Polarization is the orientation of the spin of light which is made up of flat aether particles. 

So the polarization of light (a 'boson') is the light version of the integer and half-integer spin of 'fermions'. 
 


### Invariance 

The constant speed of light is based on its emission or reflection source which itself might be moving. 

If that source is material, then it is governed by the material layer. This creates relativistic or relational motion. 


### Refraction

Photons can bend in space and matter because they are made up of 3 aether particles arranged in a 2D line.

Short Wavelengths have their aether spaced closer. 

White light is made up of various wavelengths.

When light hits a glass straight, its particles pass through together.

But when it hits at an angle, the long wavelengths get separated from the short ones. 

The long wavelengths can squeeze through irregular gaps more easily to continue their path. 

But the short ones need to follow the material more. 

The same principle applies to rainbows.

### Reflection 

Mor1s can also be reflected by bouncing off of matter. 


### Colors 

The reflection and refraction of mor1s from material bodies produces colors.  


## Magnetism

Magnetism is facilitated by virtual photons as force carrier. Like, photons, these travel in straight lines, but can be bent by matter or space.

Unlike photons, they do not reflect so easily as they are 3-dimensional and have more force to push against matter.

<!-- In Cartesian-Spinoza Physics, photons differ from electrons since they are shaped by Nature as lines, whereas electrons are shaped as spheres. 

This is why the wavelength of light is obvious, whereas those of electrons are not.  

This feature of light gives its abilities in reflection and refraction, making it unique among the 5 Elements.  -->

## Heat

Heat particles or mor3 are the crudest of the radiant forcesas it is able to affect matter directly. This allows them to be easily measureable. 

This is why the mechanics of heat of the Radiance layer is basis for the Laws of Thermodynamics. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" >}}
Heat cannot be produced in a cold object that has no heat. The form of “fire,” the quality of “heat,” and the action that “burns” are completely different things from this wood. Body A cannot move Body B unless Body A itself were also moving. It means that the flame’s body that acts against the wood is composed of small particles*. These move independently of one another with a very fast and violent motion.
