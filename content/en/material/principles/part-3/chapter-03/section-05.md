The polarization of light happens when photons (mors) go through channels in matter.


This is because mors are flat particles. Those that cannot go through the channels are absorbed by the filter.  

I answer your polarization questions by watching a video that rotates 2 filters. A 22.5 degree is brighter than 45. So Cartesian Physics matches reality whether in LEDs, stars, or filters.
