The substance of radiance are spectra, electricity, and fire. 

Sublayer | Substance | Media
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Spectrum | Photons
Middle | Electricity | Virtual Photons
Lower | Fire | Heat


These are the most obvious identities to the human mind. 


## Spectrum 

Light is part of the Upper Sublayer that includes the 'electromagnetic' spectrum.

This has the following properies:

1. Information Carrier

2. Waves

3. Energy Particles


### Information Carrier: Colors

Spectra bring information through their quality and quantity.

1. Quality: Colors

Colors are the most obvious aspect of spectra.  

2. Quantity: Bits and Intensity

This is used in computing and circuits. 


### Wave-Particle Duality

Electromagnetic particles are made up of 3 aether particles. In a photon, these are arranged in a photon in a 2D line, like dashes. 
- Short Wavelengths have their aether spaced closer. 

Light acts as a coherent straight line of waves when traveling freely. But it splits into particles whenever it hits something and collapses. We see this as flickering. 

In the double slit experiment, this creates the particle pattern when the wave collapses.

### Measure and Observe

Physics strangely interprets the double slit experiment as the act of "measuring" or "observing" a photon makes it collapse from a wave into a particle. 

This then logically leads to crackpot ideas like consciousness being the cause of the collapse.

But the blame should be put on physicists who use the words "measure" and "observe" in the first place. This is because "measure" and "observe" are human actions, and not mechanical ones. 

We fix this by rewriting it as "quantum waves collapse into particles whenever they hit something".

### Photo-Electric Effect

Wave-particle duality also is seen in the Photo-Electric Effect. This happens when energetic light hits a metal medium. 

Generally, low-energy light will just be absorbed or bounce off as color. But high ernergy light get 

Descartes' analogy for light being a particle was a tennis ball hitting the water. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/tennis2.jpg" alt="Tennis photons" >}}

A tennis ball hitting the water can have 3 outcomes depending on the energy of the ball. 

1. It can be deflected if it has high energy (line ABL)
2. It can go straight if it has medium energy (line ABD)
3. Iit can sink down if it has less energy (line ABG)

This is now seen in the Photoelectric Effect credited to Einstein. 

Einstein used the Photoelectric Effect to create the concept of quanta, which were the light balls to Descartes. Einstein then imbued the property of time on those quanta in order to create the theory of Relativity wherein light is used as a measuring rod. 

To Descartes, this measuring rod property of light is a consequence of it being a carrier. In this case, light becomes a carrier of spacetime information. 

The main difference between Descartes and Einstein is that Descartes' spacetime has far more properties than what can be relayed or carried by light. 
- One of these is material gravity (now called Newtonian gravity) and electromagnetic gravity (now called dark matter). 
- Another is constant expansion, now seen as dark energy. 
- Still another is the liquid properties of spacetime, now seen in gravitational waves. 

So Cartesian Physics unites the Double-Slit Experiment with the Photoelectric Effect and Relativity while giving insights on spacetime through Galaxy Rotation and the Hubble expansion. All of these are done with a single principle that Electromagnetism has 3 inherent properties written in 1637. 


<!-- So putting a filter in the double slit turns it to a particle. 

This also happens in the photo-electric effect which mixes up the particle property of light with its carrier property. 

However, unlike Einstein who used the photo-electric effect to sophistically give the property of time to light (i.e. light carries time), Nikola Tesla focused on its ability to carry energy. 

Einstein then used this light-carries-time sophistry for Relativity. This is why anti-gravity technology is out of reach.  -->


## Replacing Einstein

We want to discover Nature for how It really is, and not how some limited human minds see it. This is to fully use all of Nature's features just as you want to use all the awesome features of your iPhone.

This is why we replace all of Einstein's theories with Cartesian ones:

Einstein | Non-Einstein Equivalent | Difference
--- | --- | --- 
General Relativity | Law of Relativity by Poincare' | The bending is done by spacetime particles, not mass
Special Relativity | Lorentz Invariance | The relativistic effects is from the difference between radiant and spatial layers
Mass-energy equivalence | Electromagnetic potential and Radiance | All material objects have Radiance in them
Photo-electric effect | Descarte's Dioptrique | Light is a ball when it has enough energy
Einstein-Bose condensate | Dioptrical Bose Condensate | The removal of energy converts the electromagnetism in gas from a ball into a wave. This is simply the reverse of the Photo-electric effect.
Brownian Motion | Replaced with Kelvin's Motion | High energy causes the electromagnetism in matter to make the matter spread faster and gain gas properties. 

<!-- Tesla's Cosmic Rays -->

These replacement theories remove the sophistry and blockages that Einstein put Physics in, so that the freed Physics will be in line with Nature, much easier to understand, teach, and develop technologies from (such as anti-gravity).
