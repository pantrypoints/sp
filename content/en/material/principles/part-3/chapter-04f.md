Fusion uses high energy plasma to generate heat in order to generate electricity.

This is done by confining plasma away from the reactor wall. This creates plasma turbulence which forms vortices, as gyro kinetic turbulence.

The fact that eddies, turbulence, and helixes are involved in the plasma is proof of Cartesian vortices even in the dynamics of plasma. This leads to Plasma Superphysics.
