In Material Superphysics, radiant energy is the crudified version of spatial momentum.

Like the other layers, it has its own conservation law which is called the Law of Conservation of Energy, which is the first law of Thermodynamics in Modern Physics. 

It says that the total energy of a system remains constant over time. It means that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. 

THis leads to 3 implementing rules which are part of the overall 4 Laws of Thermodynamics which are based on the flow of radiant energy.

<!-- This operates in the radiant layer and is already well known in Physics.  -->

Thermodynamics Law | Meaning
--- | --- 
**1st Law** | The wave maintains its wave-ness instead of fizzling out. This leads to our perceptions (and matter) persisting instead of vanishing instantly
2nd Law (entropy) | The wave going forward. This creates the concept of linear time or perceptions coming at a sequence. This supports the 1st Law
3rd Law | The wave has a base. This also supports the 1st Law
0th Law | The wave having regular wavelengths instead of random ones, leading to heat transfer. This also supports the 1st Law. This leads to the concept of wave-size, something that is not present in Modern Physics.

<!-- 0 heat transfers -- thinker
1 conservation  -- warrior
2 entropy forwards -- trader
3 zero -- worker -->

<!-- Property | Thermodynamics | Supersociology | Supereconomics 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Continuity or Balance | 0th law | Thinker | 3rd Law 
Conservation | 1st law | Warrior | 2nd Law
Spread | 2nd law  | Traders | 4th Law
Measure or Range | 3rd law  | Worker | 1st Law -->

- The 2nd and 1st law of thermodynamics refer to the external aspects of the wave
- The 3rd and 0th laws refer to the internal aspects
