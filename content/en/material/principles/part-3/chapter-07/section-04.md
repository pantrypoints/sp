In our 5 Layer Model of physical reality, the aethereal layer is the loosest and most arbitrary, while the material layer is the most rigid and objective. 

The Radiant layer sits at the middle of the 5 layer model. This gives it properties of waves and particles at the same time. 

Part 2 explained that it is the aetherspace of the spatial that confines space-time where the physical universe resides.

Without this confinement by space-time, light can travel instantly. 

However, because of this confinement, light (and everything from the radiant to the material layer) is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second from a light source. This maximum speed of light is notated as `c`.

> Without this confinement by space-time, light can travel instantly

<!-- The movement of light in a vacuum is constant because it is the material layer that slows it down.  -->

The important thing to note is that basis of the constant speed is the light source and not the space around it.
- This means that the light cannot be sped up from its sides or front.

It can only be sped up from the light source since light is a pushing force.   

Since the speed of light is based on the source, it becomes invariant to those around it. 
- In Physics, this is called the Lorentz invariance or Lorentz symmetry.

Lorentz invariance is exposed by Lorentz transformation as length contraction `y = 1 / /1-v2/c2`.
- It is nothing without that `c`.

That `c` is a phenomenon from the radiant layer. Lorentz contraction and invariance cannot be demonstrated in total darkness or with an invisible object. 

That `c` therefore is an effect of the radiant layer operating within the spatial layer. 

This is different from Einstein's assumptions on Minkowski spacetime and Maxwell electromagnetism.

<!-- (This is after you mentioned epsilon E0 which meant that your mind jumped into magentic fields and Gauss law, which is about magnetism instead of gravity.) -->

<!-- That c effect is to limit that electrical-light family to 300,000 km/s in "all directions" from a "single source". 

The "single source" is a property of the electrical-light family of phenomena.

The "all directions" is a property of the space-and-time family of phenomena.

(Since "single source" is a property of visible electrical-light and not of space-and-time, then it means there is no Big bang of outerspace from a single point. Therefore, the Big Bang is really an effect of humans shallowly judging the universe from visible light phenomena.) -->

Therefore, `c` is an EFFECT and not a cause for the "structure of spacetime working" as believed by physicists.

Length contraction is the effect of an object taking on more of the properties of the radiant layer which is invariant coming from a single source or spot in space-time. 

This is also why a human time traveler would be Lorentz invariant and would blow away the grandfather paradox. But this will not make sense to people who take `c` to be the cause and not the effect.

### Teleportation is a change in space and time

The invariance will be essential in the teleportation process which is really a changing of both the space and time coordinates of an object. 

This is why the object has to be wrapped in an electric field prior to teleportation.

This is because the same field will be the same (invariantly) in a distant place such as in another star on the other side of the same galaxy, where the wave function is still the same but with slight differences. 

These differences are the properties of the object itself i.e. the equation of one location has the object and the other distant location doesnt have the object. 

By flipping these equations then the object changes from one location to the other.

Since teleportation changes both space and time coordiantes, then it is also the same mechanism behind time travel.

The main difference is that modifying one's gravitational signature to change time property via timespace is much more difficult than changing its spacetime property.   

Since the time traveler is invariant in a new space-time, and if the traveler is a soul that has no electro-light, then it follows that invariance is really a property of the aether which can blanket an entire space-and-time.

<!-- Therefore spacetime limits light to 300000 km/s. But it is the aetherspace (as the aether family acting on the space-and-time family) that really causes the invariance.  -->

Therefore if that light source in spacetime `X` is teleported to another spacetime `Z` where light is 400,000 km/s for example, (space-and-time is more free), then it will still be invariant to `Z-observers` but variant to an observer in the aetherspace between `X` and `Z`. 

He can then choose to live in `X` or `Z`, different from people `Z` who can only live in and perceive space-and-time `Z` and its invariance.


<!-- Electromagnetism (1st Element) as it is being confined  by spacetime (2nd Element) which itself is confined by the aether (5th Element). 

Spacetime is variant. I.e. there are many universes in the multiverse each with varying Laws. That is also why "spacetime is dynamic" as you said.

Within each spacetime system (universe) light becomes invariant because its job is the relay information. This is why it is very useful for computing and communications more than neutrinos (4th Element).

The infinite terms are a consequence of denying the aether. This is not a problem in Cartesian-Spinoza Physics where the quantization of Cartesian or Poincare Relativity leads to a finite range of possibilities. 

Yes, Cartesian-Spinoza Physics reconstructs Physics using a 5 Elements model instead of Newton's matter-based model or the Standard model that is matter-based.

Yes, it can explain macro phenomena like Mercury precession, lensing, dark energy, BAO, and especially  quantum phenomena such as superposition, wave particle duality, etc because Cartesian Physics is quantum-first that can extend easily to macro phenomena and even multiple universes

For example Here we explain the Zeeman effect and Cartesian Relativity for quantum phenomena

<!-- "Reference Frame" is a property of the aethereal family of phenomena within the space-and-time family. 

"Reference" is a property of the aether. 

Does a rock care about any reference? No it doesn't. Only humans do.

"Frame" is a property the space-and-time family of phenomena. A frame (as a cartesian plane) has spatial dimensions length and width. -->
