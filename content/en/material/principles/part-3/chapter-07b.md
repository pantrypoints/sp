19th century Physics was stumped by the fact that a wire produced electricity when it was moved across a magnet, but did not produce electricity when it was at rest

This led to Faraday's Law of Induction. His idea was that the movement caused a magnetic flux, which in Cartesian Physics is a magentic vortex.

This flux then caused an electromotive force (EMF) which then created the electricity.
- The EMF increases when the flux decreases and vice versa.

In Cartesian Physics:
- the EMF would be the ingress force that produces the electron vortex. 
- the Lorentz Force would be the egress force that produces a magnetic field.

The flaw with Faraday was that he did not know that magnetism is caused by virtual photons going through straight channels.
- The concept of channels is from Descartes in the 1630s
- The concept of virtual photons are from Feynman in the 1940s via QED



Cartesian Physics explains that electromagnetism is caused by channels whether by matter (Material Layer or 3rd Element) or by electrons (Radiant Layer or 1st Element).
- Magnetism is caused by virtual photons going through material channels
- Electromagnetism is caused by virtual photons going through channels formed by electrons.
  - Electrons line up when they flow, just like water in a plastic bottle lines up as a stream when you bore a hole at the bottom of the bottle. 

When a wire is at rest in a magnetic field, its electrons do not flow and so there is no channel.

But when the wire is moved, the electrons experience a shift in the virtual photons. This nudges them together to create a channel.

This is why the speed and angle of the wire relative to the magnet are important. 

Faraday's ignorance of virtual photons and channels led to Faraday's Paradox, which is resolved by Cartesian channels.

Physics concept | Cartesian equivalent
--- | ---
flux | vortex
charge | entrance or exit of channel
divergence | vortex direction flow of virtual photons in or out
curl | vortex rotational flow of virtual photons clockwise or anticlockwise
electromotive force | the ingress force that produces the electron vortex 
Lorentz Force | the egress force that produces a magnetic field


## The Ignorance of Maxwell Allows the Scam of Relativity

Instead of adding channels, Maxwell merely adds divergence and curl to the flux. His ignorance allows the scammer Einstein to offer a false explanation as Special Relativity.  

Instead of simply combining moving electrons + virtual photons, this Relativity scam unites matter + electromagnetism. It mandates that everything is moving and mass-energy has equivalence.

This hilarious theory says that electromagnetism is created by the length contraction of the electrons relative to the wire even if the electrons move very slowly.

The knowledge of channels not only solves Faraday's Paradox and makes Relativity unnecessary. It is also essential in deriving free energy from space since channels are needed to harness those virtual photons that are everywhere. 

Virtual photons are like money floating everywhere. But they can only be grabbed by a special claw.
