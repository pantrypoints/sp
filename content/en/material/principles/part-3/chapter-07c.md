Physics uses the concept of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) to explain the dynamics of the Radiant Layer.

Our medium-substance-quantum classification is a simpler version of the QED system which is based on sublayers and vortices.

We can use Maxwell's Equations to notate these vortices as fluxes.

### Equation 1

The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface. 

```
𝜵ꞏD = Pv
```



### Equation 2

Gauss's Law with Magnetic Flux

```
𝜵ꞏB  = 0
```

### Equation 3

The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface. 

```
𝜵x E = - 𝛅B / 𝛅t
```


This is a version of Faradays Law of Induction. 



### Equation 4

The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface. 

𝜵x H  = (𝛅B / 𝛅t) + J
