Quantum tunneling is when a subatomic particle bypasses a barrier or space in order to emerge at the other side or space. 

This is dependent on the size or distant of the separating space.

[According to Descartes]..the Sun was the fiery center of a circular stream of ether, which flowed continually round her.

In the 1630's, Descartes wrote about cosmology based on the aether-first paradigm which is opposite of Newton's matter-first paradigm. 

What we call spacetime, he called the Air Aether. 

What we call electromagnetism, he called the Fire Aether.

What we call matter or strong force, he called the Earth Aether. -->



### Descartes' Quantum Tunelling

Descartes explained quantum tunelling in Chapters 8-9 of The World as the mechanism of how stars form and emit light.

According to him, the 2nd Element (qosts in Material Superphysics) form circular paths which are then filled by electromagnetic particles.

These create energetic vortices that gather energy and emit light.

He uses an analogy of 2 rivers that meet at a point then diverge. Heavy particles merge and fuse in the central vortex created by a natural configuration of spacetime (Air Aether). The lighter particles go out of the vortex, eventually manifesting as light. 

To keep the energy going, some energetic Fire Aether tunnel to other paths, bypassing the Air Aether (Coulomb Barrier).  

From this, we clearly see that the true mechanism or driver of fusion is the arrangement of spacetime (Air Aether) at a specific point, and not the matter or strong force (Earth Aether) that is its effect, nor the electromagnetism (Fire Aether) that facilitates that accumulation of energy. 

In other words, a star's particles owes its energy, size, color, longevity, etc to the spacetime vortex or matrix that allows it to gather and gain energy from other particles in first place.

This is why the key to both natural and artificial fusion is the proper manipulation of space particles as to create a vortex or matrix for electromagnetism.

Modern Physics does not know how to do this and so nuclear fusion is still not realized. Physicists shallowly think that fusion will work if simply more electromagnetic energy is added. This is a product of materialist thinking and has failed to realize fusion on Earth. 

The Cartesian spacetime vortices not only explain how stars shine, but also explain the creation of the universe, as an aethereal Big Bang that matches the findings of the Jame Webb Space Telescope.
