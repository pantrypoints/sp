Chapter 3 explained that magnetism is caused by virtual photons entering and exiting channels in matter or electrons. 

- The exit of a channel **attracts** the entrance of another channel by facilitating the continuous flow of particles
- The exit of a channel **repels** the exit of another channel by the collision of the exiting particles


## Macro and Micro Channels from Male and Female Poles

In magnets, Physics calls:
- the entrance of the virtual photons ("striated particles" to Descartes) as the South Pole
- the exit as the North Pole

Such channels are caused by the matter having rigid, straight channels. We can call this macro or classical channels.


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Part 3, Article 107" >}}
These channels are also carved in the shape of spirals, resembling the shape of the striated particles that they admit.  Therefore, the channels that are open to one set are not open to those coming from the opposite pole and twisted in the opposite direction.

In electromagnets and circuits, Physics calls:
- the entrance for electrons ("minutiae" to Descartes) as the Cathode
- the exit as the Anode

In batteries, Physics calls:
- the entrance for electrons as the Positive Terminal
- the exit as the Negative Terminal

However, subatomic particles also experience electromagnetism. This means that they have channels within them.  

In particles:
- the presence of channels is called the negative charge
- the lack of channels is called the positive charge

We replace charges, poles, and terminals with male and female polarity.

Physics names | Material Superphysics names
--- | ---
North Pole | Male Pole
South Pole | Female Pole
Anode | Male Pole
Cathode | Female Pole
Negative Charge | Masculine Charge (presence or richness of Males)
Positive Charge | Effeminate or Feminine Charge (absence or poverty of Males)

This greatly simplifies magnetism and electronics which use the same principle of male-female unity to produce electromagnetic phenomena. This will then be useful in using electromagnetism to manipulate the aether in matter and create antigravity.

<!-- Early Physics had no concept of virtual particles and so Benjamin Franklin  

1. A rotation motion "sideways"

This shows their qualitative nature.

2. A straight-line motion forward

This shows their quantitative nature.


This represents the duality or polarization of the Radiant Layer, as the expression of the Positive and Negative Forces:

Vortex | Polarity
--- | ---
Vortex or Spin Direction | Negative (Male) and Positive (Female) Charge
Vortex or Spin Orientation | Up and Down -->


<!-- In Material Superphysics, particles actually spin. A 'charge' is therefore the rotation direction of a particle.

Technically, this would mean that an electron of a negative charge would be rotating positively. This would be confusing*. 

This is why we use 'male' and 'female' for 'negative' and 'positive' charges of Physics instead.
- The male charge represents a particle having an inherent positive (anticlockwise) rotation   
- The female charge represents a particle having an inherent negative (clockwise) rotation -->

<!-- i s="/graphics/physics/neutralcharge.gif" a="Neutral Charge" c="The green particle on the left has a postive rotation, and is male, while the red particle on the right has a negative rotation, and is female" -->


<!-- The union of two vortices rotating in the opposite direction produces friction.

This friction downgrades the spatial qosts into radiant qors.

In the radiant layer, this duality takes the form of male and female charges. 

Unlike the spatial layer, the union of male and female charges does not create friction. 

Instead, it creates union and stability. This is why we chose the name of male and female. -->


### The History of Male and Female Analogy in Metaphysics

Historically, the ancient Vedics and Taoists:
- assigned the male character to the Positive Force 
- assigned the female character to the Negative Force

By going through the particle shapes, we realized that this is because the force particles have a positive direction or rotation. These then go into matter particles which have gaps of holes for them.

{{< youtube EfY68Ni8oBQ >}}

- The force particles are like male penises
- The non-force particles are like female vaginas

This then explains why the Vedics worshipped the penis and vagina as phallus and yoni worship, respectively. 

In fact, William Gilbert, who documented Earth's magnetism, calls the attraction as Magnetick [Coition](/research/gilbert/book-2/chapter-03) which means sexual intercourse.

This is based on:
- the Positive Force being called masculine Shiva or Yang
- the Negative Force being called feminine Shakti or Yin


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/lingam.jpg" a="Shiva Lingam" c="While the Taoists use the Yin-Yang symbol to show the perfect fit of male and female energies as a general view, the Hindus use the Shiva Lingam as more technical view" >}}


<!-- This naming is also useful and intuitive for neutral charges which we call bisexual. A neutral or bisexual charge is produced when a male and female cancel each other.

This will be consistent in the convertible layer which has the concept of 'flavor-changing' which we can equate to 'sex-change' in particles.

- Like-charges, such as male to male, or female to female, create repulsion.
- Opposite-charges, such as male to female, create attraction.  -->


## Ions

Ions are atoms or molecules that gain or lose a male electron, making them:
- rich in males if they gain electrons
- poor in males if they lose electrons

This is why:
- 'negative' ions make us feel positive and energetic
- 'positive' ions make us feel negative and dull.

<!-- Rather than confuse everyone by calling the negative as positive, we would rather call:
- the negative as 'feminine charge'
- the positive as a 'masculine charge'
- the neutral as a 'bisexual charge' -->

<!-- {{< img src="/graphics/physics/atomcharges.jpg" alt="Superphysics Electron" cap="In Superphysics, electrons have a masculine charge" >}} -->


{{< q c="Kybalion" >}}
We shall use the word "Feminine" in the place of "Negative" in speaking of that pole of activity.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- Male Particles | Female Particles | Bisexual
--- | --- | ---  
qors (electron, muon, tau), moc (w- boson) | som (proton), moc (w+ boson) | soc (neutron), qocs (neutrinos), moc3 (z boson) -->

<!-- 
Quantum/Medium/Substance | Spin | Physics Charge | Mass

W- Bosons (moc1) | 1/2 | -1 |  
W+ Bosons (moc2) | 1/2 | -1 | 
Z Bosons (moc3) | 1/2 | -1 | 1776.86 MeV/c2
Neutron (soc) | 1/2 | none | 940 MeV  -->

|  | qot | 1/2 | +-1 | |  |
| Higgs Boson |  | 0 | none |  |  | -->



<!-- ## So What's the Use of Male and Female Poles? 

The charges are a consequence of identities in the Radiant layer charting a course towards the Material layer via the Convertible layer. Using genders allows a intuitive and more diversified classification that is more robust than mere positive or negative. For example, binary male and female has variations as:

- lesbian
- gay
- agender
- cisgender
- non-binary
- two-spirit
- genderfluid    

These then lead to different combination-dynamics such as:

- male + genderfluid
- lesbian + gay
- lesbian + agender
- etc

Such combinations then have different properties which might be useful in the real world. These could lead to new specialized compounds or materials. Coming up with new compounds would be more difficult in a non-intuitive system that merely has positive-negative.  -->


<!-- ## Quantum of Electricity 

As you can see, we call electron a (female) qoe [pronouncued "khoe"], and the tau a heavy qoe. We can replace all arbitrary names with this more natural system.
 -->

<!-- Gendered charges are a logical effect of flipping the materialist belief that energy and force comes from matter or the moving body. 

The gender system instead believes that the force comes from outside the body. This is proven by the Poynting vector which shows that the energy for a light bulb does not come from the battery but from the field aruond the bulb. 

So the virtual photons are males that go inside to screw female matter to give its force. 

We are not just pushing for genered charges because it gives the particle interactions a more natural context, instead of being soulless and numerical (since numbers are just quantity and have no other quality). 

It is because the discovery of the aether will lead to better control of chemical reactions leading to new compounds.

So gendered charges help classify the new compounds just as the periodic table made the classification of elements easier via proton number. 

So gendered charges are more for Chemistry, not Physics.

In Cartesian Physics, particle spin is actual spinning. This is not accepted in Physics because Heisenberg did not know about the aether which is the "backstage" of physical phenomena. 

And so his mind rejected physical particle spin because increased energy will allow violations of physical constants.  

But Cartesian Physics knows the aether. And so there is a backstage where particles that violate the constants can go to, and tunnel to other stages as other spacetimes. 

The 3/2 spin of electrons is split by Nature into cooper pairs of quasi-particles. If you didn't know how spacetime limits c, then you will not know how it creates Cooper pairs.   -->
