The Convertible Layer is divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Sublayers.

<!-- , with the Upper being made of waves, and the Lower being made up of particles. -->


Sublayer | Example | Quanta 
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | W Z Bosons | Neutrinos
Mid | Intramolecular | 
Lower | Intermolecular | 


<!-- Sublayer | Example | Quanta 
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | Flavor Changing | Z+ Boson
Mid | Chemical reactivity and Radioactivity | Z- Boson
Lower | Chemical changes | W Boson -->


### The Convertible Internal Boundary: X17

The internal boundary of the convertible layer manifests as the X17 particle which was discovered in 2016 by the Atomki Institute from collisions with Beryllium.

It has a mass of 17 MeV and was validated in 2019 by collisios with Helium.

X17 is around 242,000 times heavier than the electron neutrino just as the Higgs boson is 245,000 times heavier than the electron. 

This consistent ratio means that X17 is the Higgs for the Weak Force or Convertible Layer.
