The Media of Convertibility facilitates the changes in the material layer most commonly as chemical changes through intermolecular and intramolecular forces:


Sublayer | Example
--- | ---
Upper | W Z Bosons
Mid | Intramolecular 
Lower | Intermolecular


Convertible Relationality explains how the Convertible Layer changes particles. In Physics, this is done by the Feynman diagrams. 


## Weak Bosons

Weak bosons facilitate the decay of particles. 

Sublayer | Name | Used in 
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Gamma | sterilization  
Mid | Beta | medical imaging
Lower | Alpha | smoke detectors


## Intramolecular Forces

These manifest as strong chemical bonds leading to specific chemical behavior such as acid-base reactions.

Sublayer | Name | Description
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | Ionic | between metal and nonmetal
Mid | Covalent | Polar and nonpolar
Lower | Metallic | Gives Metals their characteristics


## Intermolecular Forces

These are weak attractions such as hydrogen bonds that keep molecultes together.

Sublayer | Name | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Upper | London Dispersion Forces | Protein folding
Mid | Dipole–Dipole Forces | Hydrogen Bonding 
Lower | Ion–Dipole Forces | boiling poin
