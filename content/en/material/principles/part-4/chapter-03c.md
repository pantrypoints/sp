These manifest as strong chemical bonds leading to specific chemical behavior such as acid-base reactions.

Sublayer | Name | Description
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | Ionic | between metal and nonmetal
Mid | Covalent | Polar and nonpolar
Lower | Metallic | Gives Metals their characteristics



## Ionic

This is when An electron is transferred from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that stick together by electrostatic attraction.

## Covalent

This is when atoms share electrons so both achieve stable electron configurations (often an octet).

Typically two nonmetals with similar electronegativities.


## Metallic

Positive metal ions are arranged in a lattice, surrounded by a “sea of delocalized electrons” that move freely.

Metals with low electronegativity.
