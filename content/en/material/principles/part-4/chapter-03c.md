These manifest as strong chemical bonds leading to specific chemical behavior such as acid-base reactions.

## Atomic Gravity instead of Electronegativity

Atomic gravity is from the virtual space particles that pushes lesser atomic masses towards larger ones. 



## Ionic

This is when an electron (qor1) is *transferred* from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that stick together by electrostatic attraction.

This happens typically between:
- a "low electronegativity" metal that loses electrons
- a "high electronegativity" non-metal that gains electrons

An Example is Sodium chloride (NaCl).
- Na♀ or v11♀ loses electrons and becomes feminine
- Cl♂ or v17♂ gains electrons and so becomes masculine

Na♀Cl♂ or v11♀v17♂ attract each other in a crystal lattice.

Properties:
- Strong bonds
- High melting/boiling points
- Often soluble in water.
- Conducts electricity only when molten or dissolved (ions are free to move).


## Covalent

This is when atoms *share* electrons so both achieve stable electron configurations (often an octet).

This happens typically with 2 nonmetals with similar electronegativities.

An example is Water H₂O or v1(2)v8
- Each H or v1 shares an electron with O or v8.
- O or v8 ends up with 8 valence electrons (stable), each H with 2 (stable).

Properties:
- Can form gases, liquids, or solids
- Lower melting/boiling points than ionic
- Poor conductors (no free charges, unless polar and dissolved)
- Directional (bond forms at specific angles, leading to shapes like tetrahedra, bent, linear).



## Metallic

Positive metal ions are arranged in a lattice, surrounded by a “sea of delocalized electrons” that move freely.

This happens to Metals with low electronegativity.

An example is rust: Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe).
- Each atom contributes valence electrons to the “sea.”

Electrons can move, giving metals their unique properties.

Properties:
- Conduct heat and electricity well (mobile electrons).
- Malleable and ductile (ions can slide while the sea of electrons keeps bonding intact).
- Shiny (electrons reflect light).
