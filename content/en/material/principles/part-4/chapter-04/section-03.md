Acids and Bases are the lower substance of conversion (SOC3). 

Part 3 explained that particles can have a male or female charge which replace the negative and positive charges of Physics. 

When combined as liquid molecules, these become bases or acids respectively. This is classified under the Convertible Layer because acids and bases require water. The Convertible Layer was historically called the Water element.

## Bases

<!-- Carbon Dioxide e6e8(2) six-eight-duo
H2) 1duoeight
Sodium Chloride e11e17 eleven-seventeen -->

<!-- Bronsted Lowry -->

A base emits male charge (electron in Physics) or absorbs a female charge. We can say that acids are male. 

An example is Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) which we notate as `11-8-1`. 

It disolves in water `1(2)-8` to form:
- `11(1♀)`
- `8-1(1♂)`

The resulting qor (electron) cancels out the existing som (proton). This then raises the pH of water.

Common bases are:

Name | Notation | Use
--- | --- | ---
Sodium Hydroxide | 11-8-1 | Caustic Soda
Calcium Hydroxide | 20-8-1 | Cement
Ammonia | 7-1(3) | Cleaners



The more males there are per unit, the stronger the base. 

 <!-- :  A common base that dissolves in water to form Na+ and OH- ions. The OH- ions react with H+ ions, neutralizing their effect and raising the pH. -->


## Acids

An acid emits a female charge (proton in Physics) or absorbs a male charge. We can say that acids are female. 

An example is Hydrochloric acid (1-17) which dissociates in water into:
- `1(1♀)`
- `17(1♂)`

This reacts with dissociated Sodium hydroxide `11(1♀)` and `8-1(1♂)` to create salt and water.



Molecule | Component 1 | Component 2
--- | --- | --- 
Sodium Hydroxide | 11(1♀) | 8-1(1♂)
Hydrochloric acid | 17(1♂)  | 1(1♀)
= | = | =  
Result | 11-17 or NaCl  | 1(2)-8 or H2O


The more females there are per unit, the stronger the acid. Common acids are:

Name | Notation | Use
--- | --- | ---
Hydrochloric acid | 1-17 | Digestion
Nitric acid | 1-7-8(3) | Fertilizers
Carbonic acid | 1(2)-6-8(3) | Softdrinks

Acids and Bases are extremely important in the physical aspects of Bio Superphysics since living things, especially humans, are mostly made up of water.
