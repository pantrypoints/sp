The quanta of conversion are neutrinos. 


Quantum | Mass
--- | --- | ---
moc1 Electron Neutrino | 0.07 MeV
moc2 Muon Neutrino | 0.17 MeV
moc3 Tau Neutrino | 23 MeV 



## Neutrino Oscillation

Like all Conversion particles, neutrinos have 2 aether particles. 

These:
- rotate against each other in order to create a neutral charge
- are unstable and so oscillate as they go through space
- make the neutrino very small, even smaller than an electron which has 3 aether particles


These properties make it very hard to detect neutrinos.

Detectors must be made up of atoms with dense nuclei such as Argon, such as in MicroBooNE. 



### Left-Handed Only

The instability of the neutrinos means that one particle will encounter friction from the W Boson or moc2. 

To solve this, all neutrinos flip into a "left-handed" position. This is why right-handed neutrinos have never been found. 



### Cartesian Neutrinos

<!-- Descartes explained that photons and neutrinos travel from star to star, exiting from one star's ecliptic (sides) and entering through another star's poles (top and bottom). 

This creates an interstellar circuit or galactic information and energy network. 

While photons are the key mechanism for crystal computers that can be used to overcome the limitations of  Moore's Law, neutrinos are the key to interstellar communication. -->

In Principia Philosophia Part 3, Article 99, Descartes described neutrinos as thin, flexible solar particles that go from star to star. 

{{< youtube vPeCy4A0Cpg >}}

Their thinness allows them to go through matter unhindered, while their flexibility now manifests as oscillations that let them carry data. 

These make them an excellent tool for star-to-star communication, as how stars "talk" to each other. 

Physicists have proven this by testing neutrinos for underground communication. 

Since neutrinos are naturally created from vortex-surfaces, then it follows that galaxy-vortices (supermassive blackholes) should emit even more neutrinos than stars. 

Accordingly, this is what the neutrino observatory in Antarctica observed recently from galaxies called blazers: NG 1068, NG 4151, and NG 3079. There were detected to emit high-energy neutrinos, matching Descartes' principles.

To Kepler, stars affect everything on planets from weather and climate, to socio-political events. Descartes somewhat agrees to this but only explains the changes in weather and climate from stars. 

So it makes sense to detect the neutrinos that go from star to star, or galaxy to star, in order to plot the changes that they cause so that proper predictions and interventions can be done ahead of those changes. 

An advanced alien species might create a Dyson sphere, not to harvest energy from their sun (since empty space has free energy anyway), but to intercept the neutrinos that reach their sun, like wiretapping stellar communication.

This would make sense if the species has already spread to the habitable planets and moons in that system. This would reduce the uncertainty in that solar system and make life more stable for all.

A neutrino goes through matter because it is very small and flexible. This allows it to go with the aetherspace and pass through, staying unnoticed. 

The spacetime around liquids are also flexible
