The instability of the convertible layer is the main reason for its ability to change matter. 

Unlike the aether and spatial particles which are invisible, and the radiant and material particles which are either too fast or unchanging, the convertible particles are observable yet changing. 

This lets us see rationalize their aether content based on the 5 Layer model. 


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/decay.jpg" a="Aether conservation" >}}

This model says that each layer has a corresponding number of aether particles.  


Layer | Aether particles
--- | ---
Aether | 5
Spatial | 4
Radiant | 3
Conversion | 2
Material | 1


This is important for beta decay which is the upgrade of a particle back to the aether.
