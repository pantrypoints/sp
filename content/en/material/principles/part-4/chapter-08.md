Part 3 explained that a particle's gender (male for negative charge, female for positive) stands for its rotation direction. This assumes that the particle is staying still while rotating. 

Spin is another concept that shows the orientation direction.

Helicity is how the particle moves forward: 

- "Right Handed" means it moves forward with a positive (anticlockwise) rotation  
- "Left Handed" means it moves forward with a negative (clockwise) rotation 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/spin.jpg" a="Particle Spin and Helicity and Charge" c="Particle Spin, Helicity, and Charge" >}}


While Charge and Spin are relevant to the Radiant Layer, Helicity is relevant to the Convertible.  

Charge, Spin, and Helicity are all revealed when the particle is put through an electromagnetic field. This is because the Radiant Layer is superior to the Convertible Layer. 

- A particle can either be right-handed or left-handed
- Particles of the same charge must have opposite-handed spins while those of different charges can have the same-handed spins per energy level



<!-- But spin does not take into the account of the relational movement between the spin direction of the particle and its forward movement.

Helicity does that. And so spin has 2 properties in the Convertible Layer: 

1. Magnitude

- Quanta and Substances have a spin of 1/2 (via magnetic fields) which means it has 2 spin states
- Media have a spin magnitude of 1 (via polarization) which means it has 3 spin states
- Elements have a nuclear spin from 1/2 onwards, depending on the sum of its spins. This means it has more than 3 spin states
 -->

Helicity determines whether a particle converts or does not convert into different Matter particles. 


<!-- The spin of a particle is determined only after it goes through detectors which impose electromagnetism on it. This taps the male-female charge principle of the Radiant Layer. -->

<!--  This imposition causes the particle to react and respond with its own interpretation of the magnitude and direction of that energy based on the nature of that partcile. 

Thus:
- force-particles react with a spin of 1
- matter-particles react with a spin of 1/2
- elements react with a spin from 1/2 onwards -->

<!-- We can therefore equate the idea of spin to the ability of particles to mirror the qualities of the detectors or **reflect the energies imposed on them**. We will call it more properly as "binary reflectivity*" instead of spin. A particle will react with an up or down reflectivity to a detector that measures an up or down direction, and a right or left one to a detector that measures a right or left direction. -->

<!-- > *Wolfgang Pauli called it "Classically non-describable two valuedness" -->

<!-- img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/argonspin.jpg" alt="Argon Spin" cap="Spin is the inherent ability of particles to mirror the forces or actions done on them. In double slit experiments, the detector influences the particle, causing changes in the interference pattern. In quantum eraser experiments, the particles react differently depending on whether they are erased or not. “Erased” photons merely change locations or quantum-teleport depending the outcome for the entangled partner, and do not undergo retrocausality."


## So What's the Use of Binary Reflectivity of Particles?

This property of reality explains how mentality creates reality -- because reality really just reflects the mind of the existing entity. 

This is not so easy to prove because there are many instances when our mentality creates a reality opposite from our desires. However, this is not the fault of Nature, but of the mind not acting to its dharma, tao, or true nature. This causes it to sabotage itself. 

In theory, this principle of the electromagnetic layer can be used:

- to improve chemical transformations and reactions by making elements reflect better properties that are in the location. This explains why the crops from one region taste better than those from another, despite using the same seeds and fertilizers. In theory, the good properties of Location A can be sent electromagnetically to Location B
- for light-based computing where photons are entangled in liquid crystals as to be able to process more information than electricity-based computers
- for the teleportation of vehicles. In theory, the spins of all of a ship's particles in Location A can be switched to that of Location B to teleport it  -->


<!-- Quantum Decoherence -- imposing on the wave to turn it to particles. -->

<!-- Entangled particles change their spin instantly to match the detector or the observer, "collapsing" into reality. It also gives an illusion of  retrocausality, when in fact it just shows non-locality. This non-locality is then the foundation of teleportation. -->


<!-- We convert these into waves:

1. Frequency

Instead of magnitude, we use wave frequency so that:

- Force-waves have a frequency of 1 (via polarization)
- Matter-waves have a frequency of 1/2 (via magnetic fields)
- Element-waves have a nuclear frequency from 1/2 onwards, depending on the sum of its frequency

2. Directional Purpose as unifying or divisive

- A wave can either be unifying (positive) or divisive (negative)
- Waves of the same direction (unifying and unifying) must have opposite frequencies.
  - An example is a classical music being made up of different instruments. 
  - Another example is a family made up of husband and wife. 
- Waves of different directions (unifying and dividing) can have the same frequency per energy level. 
  - An example is a classical guitar and an electric guitar. 
  - Another example is a husband Mr. Smith and another husband Mr. Jones.
