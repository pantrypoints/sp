The material layer is the lowest layer in the universe and manifests as physical objects. 


Attribute | Quality
--- | ---
Name | **Matter**
Physics Name | Strong Interaction
Traditional Name | Earth, Pritvi, 金
Descartes' Name | 3rd Element
Domain | Physical
Force | Staticity
Medium | Mesons (mom1)
Substance | Protons (soa)

An example of a material thing is iron ore.


### Definition of the Material Layer

The material layer is the crudest and least energetic of all the layers. It is totally static. All its movements are facilitated by the upper layers, especially by the radiant and convertible.  

<!-- Instead of elements, Superphysics refers to the 'elements'* as 'versions'. Thus, there are 118 versions of matter which are simply 118 versions of energy in the material layer.  -->

<!-- n n="'Matter' is rooted on 'mother' in Latin, while 'Element' is based on 'rudiment'" -->


### The Fulfillment of Creation 

In terms of creation, this layer is the final layer in the journey of dynamic energy and entropy towards stasis and is where mind is at its most dormant state.

Thus, an idea from the Supreme starts as:
- an idea in the aethereal layer 
- then it is emitted via galaxies in the spacetime layer
- then it spread as particles in the radiant (electromagnetic) layer
- then it is transformed by the transformative layer into basic versions (elements)
- then it is hardened into one of the 118 versions in the material layer 

According to science, iron ore is made of 'elements', specifically as `Fe` which is one of the 118 known elements.

<!-- The conversion from dormant mind into active mind then takes place in stars. In this way, both matter (dormant mind) and life (active mind) come from the explosion of stars as the expression or crossing-over of the metaphysical ideas of the Supreme Entity onto physical reality.  -->


We call quarks as `qom` or quantum of matter, just as we called gravitons as qost or quantum of spacetime. So far, the common fundamental material particles are:
