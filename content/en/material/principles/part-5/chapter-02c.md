<!-- - If Qost A has an inherent quality that is 100 units repulsive to Qost B, then the spacetime between them might be 100 distance-units per 1 unit of time-perception. 
- But if Qost C is only 50 units repulsive, then Qost C will be 50 units away from Qost B at the same time. 
- This would show Qost A moving faster away from Qost B than Qost C. 
  - In Physics, this manifests as it having a red-shift which will indicate a growing distance. -->


In Part 1, we explained action-at-a-distance using aethereal effort, as the Eagle, and Cartesian Relationality. 

In Part 2, we explained 2-dimensional space-time slices are stitched together by the mind to create a 3-dimensional reality. 

Here, we apply those concepts to explain and convert Newtonian contact forces into the Material Superphysics paradigm. 

According to Newton's Second Law, net force equals mass times acceleration. This assumes an absolute space. 

But Material Superphysics uses relational spacetime slices. So we apply our eagle to the problem below.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" a="The Eagle" >}}


{{< q >}}
A box is pushed with an initial speed of 4.2 m/s. The friction is 0.18. How far will the box go?
{{< /q >}}

```
acceleration :: -0.18 * 9.81 m/s
```

The force of friction is 1.764 m/s2

```
0 = (4.2)^2 + 2(-1.764) d
```

The Newtonian system gives a distance is 5 meters. 


### Cartesian Relationality

We next use the same data for Cartesian Relationality.

```
0E Block : 5m : 1E Block 
```

We put:
- the intial force to the 1E variable
- the friction force to the 1st block 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/box2.jpg" a="A box moved" c="A box moved" >}}


<!-- We then apply the formula to a 50 kg block pushed forward accelerating constantly at 1 m/s{{< s v="2" >}}

```elixir
F = Gm2 [GP second] - Gm1 [GP second]
```

```elixir
50N = 100N - 50N
``` -->

This gives us the same result as `F = m a`

The main difference is that this new version splits the identity of the object into two or more different objects. The block at time 2 location 2 is different from the same block at time 1 location 1 in the sense that it has absorbed force and changed its locational attributes.

Newton's laws, however, see the object as the same object. This limits it to linear, forced movements.

This will then be useful for teleportation by a change in spin*.

<!-- Metaphysically:
- the Kepler tensor represents the Yang or Shiva
- the limiter represents the Yin or Shakti
- the `G` represents dharma, which is Yang-Shiva when confined by Yin-Shakti -->

<!-- - From the perspective of planets, the limiter takes the form of Newton's `G`, which leads to `g` when two masses are added 
- From the perspective of light, the limiter takes the form of Einstein's `c`, which leads to relative space versus time when "reference frames" are added
- From the perspective of galaxies, the limiter takes the form of an aethereal "dark matter", which leads to "dark energy" when red shift is added

Thus, the limiter harmonizes the theories of Pythagoras, Newton, Einstein, and Descartes -->
