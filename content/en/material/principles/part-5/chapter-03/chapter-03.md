The main media of the material layer are the forces that facilitate the binding or repulsion of molecules as solid, liquid, gas, and Bose condensate.

State of Matter | Intermolecular Force | Radiant Energy
--- | --- | ---
Solid | Strong | Potential
Liquid | Medium | 
Gas | Weak | Kinetic


Unlike Newtonian Physics which believes that contact forces come from matter, Material Superphysics knows that they come from mos as the aetherspace. 
- This aetherspace is opposed to spacetime.

 <!-- This leads to the concepts of pressure such as air pressure and hydraulic pressure.  -->

The material forces are:

Force | States | Description 
--- | --- | ---
Friction | Solid, Liquid, Gas |  
Air/Liquid Pressure and Resistance | Gas | 
Surface Tension | Solid | 
Contact Force | Solid, Liquid, Gas |


### Friction

Physics defines friction as the force that opposes motion upon contact.

Material Superphysics, on the other hand, defines it as the reduced volume of space particles (qosts) that flow between bodies.

Since friction is based on the lack of space particles then it is observable in the Radiant and Material Layers:

Phenomenon | Layer
--- | --- 
Non-Movement or Lesser movement | Material
Light as sparks | Radiant
Heat | Radiant
Static Electricity | Radiant 

Note that Reverse Gravity is not classified as an effect of friction because friction implies the movement of surfaces, as opposed to being static after being set. 

In the Material Layer, friction is revealed by the coefficient of friction `u` as:

```
u  F/N
``` 

Where:
- `N` is the normal force
- `F` is the frictional force, as the normal force reduced 



### Air Pressure: Bernoulli's Principle

We explained this in Part 2 to describe the dynamics of gravity as high-low pressure. 

This includes Buoyant Force, Coriolis Effect. 

<!-- The medium of matter is not the gluon, but the aetherspace which connects 2 or more quark particles together, according to Cartesian Relationality.
