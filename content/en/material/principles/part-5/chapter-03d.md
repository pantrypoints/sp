Physics is matter based, applying the natter in F = ma into fluid dynamics called Navier-Stokes equations. 

<!-- Sure, that's easy. Our paradigm is the pre Newtonian Physics of Descartes, Spinoza, and George Berekely, which aligns perfectly with Asian Physics of Hinduism and Taoism (inventors of gunpowder through the Water Element). -->

 
For example for whirlpools, the Navier-Stokes equation is du/dt + (u∇)u = -1/p ∇p + v∇^2u + f

- du/dt is just the gradient (This is the acceleration part)
- (u ∇) u is the directional speed of the fluid as whirlpool rotation (This is the mass part)
- -1/p ∇p is internal pressure force (This is the force part)
- v∇^2u is the internal friction
- f is the external force like gravity 

This works for typhoons in the short term, but not for the long term, as proven by typhoon models which change drastically.

This is because the Newtonian system does not account for the whirlpool as a complete system made up of 5 Elements.

For example, it only has 3 Elements:

- 1/p ∇p and v∇^2u for material particles or material forces
- f for space and electromagnetic particles or forces

It totally misses out the aether and conversion forces (weak force). Newton seems to have not accounted for the conversion force because he did no chemistry experiments. In contrast, Descartes did chemistry by being exposed to gunpowder and medicine in the European wars. 


## The Solution

We put the aether in the vortex side and the weak force in the gradient size. This accounts for the butterfly effect on the right side turning a classical navier stokes into "quantum" mechanics i.e. adding the aether (virtual 5th Element and 2nd Element particles) to classical mechanics then you get quantum mechanics. 

It is then the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative that makes the aether rotate. Since the aether is not material, then `F = ma` does not apply. 

Instead we use Descartes' 1st Rule of Motion: There is no void in Nature. This explains the dynamics of the cosmic web and of climate change (supertyphoons in Taiwan while drought affects Iran at the same time). 

The big problem was that Newton and Einstein had no concept of [virtual (quasi) space particles](/research/descartes/philosophy/part-3/article-48/). And so their fluid equations always assumed fluids to has mass.

But the aether is totally massless and is best seen in chakras (rotating organic vortices) and chi which Descartes calls animal spirits. 

UFOs use this as "Gravity A" waves.
