The aetherspace manifests as atomic space. 

This leads to the fine any hyperfine structure of the atom. 

Bohr's Quantum Theory Of Line-Spectra Part 2 Section 3 explains the "fine structure" which is based on Sommerfield.

This fine structure explained the splitting of spectral lines in atom from when different energies are applied to it. 

This is different from the orbital model of the atom that was accepted before. 

That model was based on Newtonian gravity creating orbits by centripetal forces.  


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/hyperfine.jpg" a="Atom model" >}}

Material Superphysics, which is derived from Descartes' Physics, explains that the splitting of spectral lines is from the property of the aetherspace to separate identities. 

<!-- Unlike Newton's system which is based on mass, Bohr's system is based on energy states and levels. -->

The different energy levels changes the states of the aetherspace. 

These states follow the 1st Law of Descartes which we call the No Void Rule. 

This is why the electron around a nucleus follows different dynamics from planets around a star. 
- the planets follow the dynamics of virtual space particles
- electrons follow the dynamics of the aetherspace


<!-- The quantum states are consistent with Descartes' First Law of Motion which is based on the state of the body, which is different from Newton's First Law which is based on inertia from rest mass.

This whole concept of rest mass is one of the illusions of Nature which Rene Descartes debunked over and over with his explanation of the true nature of motion, rest, and space, which occupies nearly half of Part 2 of Principia Philosophia. -->

<!-- Unlike the solar system, electrons do not follow a sequential orbit around the nucleus. This is because the space inside an atom is the aetherspace.    -->


### The Aetherspace Versus Spacetime

Inside the atom, local motion gives way to true motion due to the lack of spacetime particles which are replaced instead by aetherspace particles. 

These replace orbits with quantum levels that rely on state. These are consistent with Descartes' "superficies" which were called gravitational territories in spacetime. In the aetherspace, Physics are called shells. 

We can make an analogy with planetary orbits:

Attribute | Star-Spacetime | Atom-Aetherspace 
--- | --- | ---
Slave | Planet | Electron
Slave Action | Rotation Speed from Spacetime | Spin Direction (vortex rotation) from Aetherspace
Path | Orbiting Speed from Spacetime | Orbital Speed (Angular Momentum) from Aetherspace


- The "fine" structure is the relationality* of the electron's vortex rotation and its orbital speed in the aetherspace. 
- The "hyperfine" structure is the relationality of the electron's vortex rotation, its orbital speed, and the vortex rotation of the nucleus in the aetherspace. 


Structure | Relationality
--- | ---
Fine | electron vortex : electron orbital speed : 
Hyperfine | electron vortex : electron orbital speed : nucleus vortex rotation

Descartes explained spin as the 1st Element (electrons) being vortices manifesting as corkscrews. These can become longer and larger depending on energy. This creates magnetism when they are all aligned, and tunneling in stars (explained in The World Chapter 9).

Lastly, the emission of hydrogen lines as radiowaves or light is a consequence of the wave-particle nature of the 1st Element which Descartes compared to solid grapes and liquid grape juice. 

- The more energy is applied to a bunch of grapes, as feet crushing it, the more it will become liquid juice moving away.
- The less energy, the more it becomes solid grapes staying together.

These then dictate how the electron will jump its shells. 





<!-- v-a The fine-structure constant (α ≈ 1/137) dictates the strength of the electromagnetic force

v-s determining how electrons interact with light and fields, 

v-s their speed relative to light (about 1/137 c in hydrogen), 

v-a the size of atoms, and the very possibility of stable matter and chemistry. 

v-a  It governs the fine splitting of atomic energy levels (the "fine structure"), affecting electron behavior and binding to nuclei, essentially setting the rules for how electrons "orbit" and form the structure of the universe.

v-s Governs Electromagnetic Interaction: α is the coupling constant for electromagnetism, showing how strongly electrons (and other charged particles) "feel" electromagnetic forces and exchange photons.

s-v-a Determines Electron Speed: In a hydrogen atom, it sets the electron's average speed to about 1/137th the speed of light (\(c/137\)).

v-a Shapes Atomic Structure: It influences how tightly electrons bind to the nucleus, affecting atomic size and the stability of heavy elements, defining the upper limits of the periodic table (around Z=137).

v-a Causes Fine Structure: It explains the slight splitting of atomic energy levels (fine structure), which arises from relativistic effects and electron spin-orbit interactions, leading to more detailed spectral lines.

Enables Chemistry: Its specific value allows atoms to form, molecules to bond, and stable matter to exist; if it were different, chemistry and life as we know it wouldn't be possible. In essence, α is a fundamental dimensionless number that dictates the electron's place and behavior within the quantum world, making atoms and the universe recognizable.  -->
