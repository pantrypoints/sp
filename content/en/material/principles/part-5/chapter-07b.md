Unlike Newtonian Physics where mass is so important, other factors such as rotation, orbital speed, and distance from sun are important in understanding the gravity of different planets.  


Name | Gravity Speed in m/s2 | Diameter in km | Density in g/cm3
--- | --- | --- | ---
Ceres | 0.27 (3% of earth) | 940 | 2.2
Earth | 9.81 | 12,742 | 5.5 
Jupiter | 23.1 | 142,800 | 1.3
