Physics says that 2 bodies do not go through each other because their electrons repel each other through the Pauli Exclusion Principle

But it would mean that there should be a probability that the electrons would go through each other just like particles can probabilistically quantum-tunnel through barriers

Physicists reply that the repulsion is not from the electrons, but the "quantum state" of the electron's cloud

But this would mean that it is the cloud-state that repels the other cloud-states. This means that bodies should go through each other if their states were changed

But in reality, changing the state merely makes the atoms emit light and still not go through

Cartesian Physics answers that it is the "cloud" itself that repels the other atom-clouds. The electron has NOTHING to do with contact forces

This cloud is called the 2nd Element. In an atom, it does 2 things:

1. It binds quarks as the Strong Force
2. It repels other atoms as the Contact Force 

To smash a particle is to force clouds into each other. This breaks them up and converts them back into the invisible aether or 5th Element.

This is why gravitons, dark matter, and supersymmetry particles could not be detected in particle colliders

The Exclusion Principle was created to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect 

It was believed that it was caused by the nucleus just as the sun causes orbits

Pauli transferred the mechanism to the electron itself as "2-value" spin as integer and half-integer, instead of + and - spin like charges, simply because the scammer Einstein had established the dogma of E=mc^2 prior

This then creates the confusion that says electrons spin but they don't

Pauli's spin theory leads to symmetry which leads to supersymmetry

The failure of supersymmetry is PROOF that Pauli was wrong and that the mechanism for the Zeeman effect is the space and not the electron, just like a planet's orbit is caused by its surrounding space as the 2nd Element
