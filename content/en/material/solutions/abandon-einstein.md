## The Crisis in Modern Physics

The world faces some of its most pressing physical challenges:
- global warming
- the threat of nuclear weapons
- chronic energy shortages
- the risk of comet impacts

These issues all fall squarely within the domain of physics.

Yet, since the 1920s, physics has been on the wrong path—largely due to the influence of Albert Einstein. 

His theories, particularly relativity, have dominated education and research, stifling progress and contributing to real-world suffering.


## Einstein's Role in the Problems

Einstein's work provided the theoretical foundation for nuclear fission (via E=mc²).

He played a key role in urging the US to develop atomic weapons during World War 2 as the Manhattan Project.

While Einstein later regretted this involvement and became an advocate for nuclear disarmament, his legacy is tied to the creation of weapons that have killed hundreds of thousands and continue to threaten humanity.

Beyond nukes, Einstein's framework has limited solutions to other crises:
- **Global warming** → Economists are forced into "absurd" schemes like carbon credits because physicists haven't delivered practical alternatives.
- **Nuclear threats** → Politicians arm nations against rivals like Russia, perpetuating fear.
- **Energy shortages** → Oil-rich countries gain disproportionate power.
- **Comet impacts** → Astronomers can only warn the public, powerless to act.

These failures stem from a physics that prioritizes mathematical elegance over metaphysical understanding of root causes.

## The Path Forward: Reviving Descartes' Physics

René Descartes (1596–1650), in his *Principles of Philosophy* (1644), offered a mechanistic physics based on 3 elements:  

1. The First element -- this is subtle, fast-moving matter (like fire or light)
2. The Second element -- these are Larger spherical particles forming a stable fluid (akin to air)
3. Third element -- these are gross terrestrial matter

The universe is filled with swirling vortices of the second element, explaining planetary motion, light, and more. This system, though later eclipsed by Newton, provides a holistic alternative.

We propose returning to Cartesian principles to solve today's crises:
- Global warming is solved by harnessing the **second element** for controlled nuclear fusion, producing clean, abundant energy without fossil fuels
- Nuclear weapons are suppressed by the **second element** (analogous to "cold" dark matter), neutralizing fission reactions
- Energy shortages are tapped via **vacuum energy**, a concept Nikola Tesla championed—extracting limitless power from the ether-like vacuum
- Comet impacts are deflected by manipulating the **second element** vortices to alter trajectories

Descartes' physics emphasizes interconnected matter and motion, offering practical mechanisms where relativity provides only descriptions.


## The Immorality of Clinging to Einstein

Physics educators and researchers who rigidly teach relativity and idolize Einstein as a genius has perpetuated harm since the 1920s.

From atomic bombs to climate disasters, their teachings have indirectly caused deaths and suffering. By ignoring metaphysical foundations, they trap science in a paradigm that fails humanity.

We call on young students to reject this outdated dogma. Embrace Descartes' unified, mechanistic vision—where physics integrates with deeper causes. Only then can we solve these existential threats and build a sustainable future.
