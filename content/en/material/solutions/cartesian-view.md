In [a previous post](/material/fallacies/general-relativity), we explained our equation for everything as:

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" alt="E = gl equation" cap="Our equation for everything has 3 components: Force as Energy, Dharma as G, Element as L" >}}



In this post we explain its active form as:

![Kepler Tensor](/graphics/super/kepler.png)

This is made up of two parts, separated by a colon or ratio sign*;
- The Kepler Tensor G{{< sub v="(s)" >}} which has:
  - The gravitational signature G
  - The limiter {{< sub v="(s)" >}}. This is inferred from the type and time of the Cartesian view
- The Cartesian View: This is the plane, layer, and timespan where the motion takes place. It has two parts: 
  - Aethereal Plane: This is the cause of all movements 
  - Physical Plane: This is for physical movements that carry over from the aethereal plane
