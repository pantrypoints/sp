In the 1630's, Rene Descartes explained that a star is an electromagnetic vortex which is formed by the gathering of spacetime particles.

This gathering is like the meeting of 2 rivers that lets boats cross over or 'tunnel' to the other side.

This tunneling allows the boats to fuse with each other and produce more energy as light. 

This is now known as quantum tunneling, which is essential for nuclear fusion in stars. 

<!-- It gets its energy from the quantum tunelling of material particles between the 'rivers' of  in the center of its vortex. -->

<!-- We use this principle  -->

The key to making an artificial star is therefore to recreate a spacetime vortex. Accordingly, this is what Tesla attempted when he made his Tesla coil which was supposed to power a wireless-energy-transmission powerplant. 

Its problem was that Tesla did not seem to understand vortex dynamics.  

This is solved by a proper vortex design where large deuterium space is funneled into a smaller one, forming the core of the vortex where it meets its other half as a tritium space going in the opposite direction.

The system will use anti-gravity from the aether instead of magnetic confinement to facilitate and confine the vortex motion.

This is ideal for small vehicles, leading to a saucer shape*. The same anti-gravity that the fusion reactor uses to move its hydrogen can be used to float the reactor itself, leading to a flying saucer-shaped reactor. This is one of the requirements of Tesla's power plant design that was never realized.   


{{< n n="*The most popular UFO design is from Bob Lazar which uses an antimatter energy source. However, this would not be sustainable just as a nuclear submarine would have a finite nuclear fuel source. This is why antimatter UFOs have a compact design and is used for exploration, since they are lightweight. Fusion designs on the other hand are for self-sustaining craft. The fuel can be sourced from planets." >}}



For more power, the 'arms' of the vortex can be arranged horizontally so that the energy will escape vertically similar to the vertical jets that go out of a quasar. 

This is ideal for larger vehicles, leading to a football, tictac, or cigar shape.

The resulting helium could be recycled back into hydrogen by fission reaction. However, this would use a lot of energy and it is likely that the reactor would simply get new hydrogen from outside. 

 
<!--  that is confined primarily by anti-gravity instead of magnetic confinement. This anti-gravity can only be done through the aether, since the aether is superior to spacetime. The compression of matter in the vortex leads to friction which creates sparks which manifest as heat and photons.  

More energy can be harnessed by increasing the friction between particles. 


This is why UFOs prefer to stay within the gravitational field of planets where they can get hydrogen. In the vacuum of space, they can only get spacetime energy. The fact that we never see UFOs coated in black solar panels means that the spacetime energy is far more reliable and more energetic than solar energy. -->
