<!-- In a past post, we explained [Material Bands for contact forces](/material/principles/part-5/chapter-03) by starting with an example of action at a distance, as levitation. This was to introduce the concept of metaphysical Effort, as being different from the physical Force from Newton. -->

The Relativity of Einstein is totally debunked by the reality of non-magnetic levitation and prelevitation as seen in:

- levitating Buddhist monks
- Egyptian pyramid blocks and other ancient blocks made lighter for easier construction
- zipping UFOs that produce no sonic boom because they **insert** themselves into the air mass, instead of crashing through

This is done through "atom-shaking" which aligns atoms, by changing their state, to allow qosts (virtual spacetime particles called 2nd Element in Cartesian Physics) to pass through.  

Since gravity is caused by the qosts/2nd Element, then letting them pass through reduces their gravitational push-force on the body. 

This alignment is done through the effort of the aether or soa (substance of aether) since the aether is the superior Element or Layer. We notate this force as Effort or `E`. This then matches our universal equation `E::Gl`

<!-- 
Here, we explain Effort as implemented to create action-at-a-distance, something that is not known in Physics. This is  because Einstein cancelled the aether which facilitates it. 

In contrast, Superphysics enshrines the aether as the top or boss-layer of physical reality. 

This is still in line with Nature since Maxwell, Fresnell, Hertz, Lord Kelvin, and Tesla all believed in the aether. It is therefore only Einstein who is out of line. This in turn is why technology is so limited and humans still use Newtonian rockets (based on 17th century principles) to go to outer space.

We take a 1 kilogram object and put it on a weighing scale. We then apply a prolonged emission on it to impose the soa. We find this reduces its weight by 1 gram. We call this prelevitation which is making a thing lighter without actually levitating.

<!-- then use this as the basis for a levitating object propelled by the aether.    -->

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/aethertech.png" a="Crude Aether technology" c="Crude aether technology can be done with home equipment to create action at a distance. As we only use household tools such as a digital kitchen scale, we find inconsistencies in the weight change. But this is still different from having no change in the control (i.e video-record the weight-value for 10 minutes with and without the aether induction). The nature of spacetime and atom-shaking explains why all UFOs must be symmetrically shaped" >}}


Technically, this produced very tiny vertical movement and we are not able to create horizontal movement. But  in theory, horizontal movement is possible by adjusting the soa. This is already proven by levitating monks and would need more conscious aethereal effort to travel horizontally i.e. they usually go vertically unconsciously. 

This was done by Canadian inventor John Hutchison, as the Hutchison effect, for material objects using high frequency electromagnetic waves. However, he didn't seem to know Cartesian Physics and the mechanism behind the phenomena. And so, he wasn't able to replicate it. 


<!-- This is where `G`, `g`, and the Kepler tensor will be necessary to change the state of an object in order to move it through spacetime without needing contact forces.   -->


### How it Works: All 5 Layers Work Together to Create Physical Reality

In our experiment, we applied soa on a material object in order to reduce the force of gravity or `most` (medium of spacetime) on it.  

This manifests as a slight movement which is recorded by the weighing scale. 

More technically, **the external aether changed the gravitational signature of the object to alter its Cartesian Relation with the Earth**.

This means that, logically, the ability to change and generate movement for solid objects comes from the Material layer through the Convertible Layer. This matches the findings of Isaac Newton.*

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia, Scholium" >}}
The uniform gravity of a body acts equally in equal particles of time on that body to create equal velocities
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia, Book 3" >}}
A Spirit pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies. Its action and force causes the particles of bodies to mutually attract one another at near distances, cohere if contiguous, emit light and heat bodies. 

All animal bodies move at the command of the will through the vibrations of this Spirit. These vibrations travel from our sense organs to the brain, from the brain to the muscles.
{{< /q >}}


Newton could have developed the idea of atom-shaking if only he chased down that dynamics of that Spirit. 

{{< n n="Newton said that gravity comes from the spirit of 'Lord God' which goes through matter. In Cartesian Phyics, this spirit is the same as substance as the aether. This scholium then distributes that spirit, as gravity, into equal time-particles, matching Descartes' distribution of the aether onto a constantly dividing 2nd Element which includes space and time. The main difference with Newton is that he preferred inertial matter instead of spinning vortices" >}}


Thus, the sequence of events is:

Sequence | Layer | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | Aether | The intention to move the mass
2 | Radiant (Electromagnetism) | The emission is created
3 | Material (Strong) | The emission hits the identity (object with mass)
4 | Convertible (Weak) | This creates a change in the identity
5 | Spatial (Spacetime) | This moves the object

As you can see, all 5 layers are used to create the reality of the movement of the object. This then matches our principle that all physical movement and change involves all 5 layers, ultimately commanded by the aethereal layer. 
 
Modern Physics persistently denies the aether and even the spatial layer (as other universes and non physical entties) and so it has no idea how to maniuplate gravity.  

<!-- 
	From here, we can easily see how aether tech makes sense in construction. This is consistent in early civlizations which built large and heavy infrastructure, such as Egyptian pyramids, without any knowledge of electricity or even combustion. This tech only needs the discovery of fire as to create the construction tools. It doesn't even need writing technology since aether knowledge is best transmitted through oral tradition just as you can learn from YouTube videos faster than from reading a book. 

	Accordingly, we see Hindus preferring oral teachings, and the Egyptians not writing their aether technology down. Instead, the latter taught it orally to Pythagoras which taught it to his followers. Eventually it was learned by Timaeus who was recorded by Plato which we can read now online. 

	Timaeus' account of the aether is important as it must match the aether of the Hindus (akasha) who use it to propel themselves, as levitating monks, instead of for construction. This then supports the case for aethereal propulsion in vehicles. The purported round shape of UFOs match our basic concept for propelling a mass using Descates' First Rule of Movement instead of Netwon's 3rd Law used in rockets. -->
