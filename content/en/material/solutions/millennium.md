The Millennium Prize Problems are:

1. Hodge Conjecture

This problem asks about the relationship between the shapes of solutions to certain equations and other algebraic properties.

2. Yang Mills and Mass Group

This is related to the fundamental forces of nature.

3. P vs NP

This is one of the most famous problems in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly checked by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. This has major implications for cryptography, optimization, and many other areas.

4. Riemann Hypothesis

This is a longstanding problem in number theory, concerned with the distribution of prime numbers. It has major consequences for our understanding of integers and basic arithmetic.

5. Birch-Swinnerton Dyer Conjecture

This problem relates the number of solutions (points) on a special kind of curve to another property of the curve. It has a lot of evidence supporting it.

6. Navier Stokes Existence and Smoothness

These equations describe how fluids move. Unfortunately, mathematicians can't prove that solutions always exist and are without jumps or sharp corners.

7. Poincare Conjecture

This is a question about the shape of three-dimensional spaces. Grigori Perelman was awarded a Fields Medal for his solution. 



## Using Qualimath to Solve Them

The most obvious cause of the problem is the nature of the mathematics that was established from the time of Isaac Newton.

Unlike the math of the ancient Greeks which are based on Nature, as explained by Euclid, the math of the modern Europeans are based on their own limited minds that can only describe quantities. They then compare the resulting quantities with real observed quantities.

We fix this limited paradigm by creating a math, called Qualimath, that focses on qualities.

The resulting qualities are then compared to real observed qualities. This requires a definition of the qualities in question. This then requires the minds using the qualimath to **mutually agree** to the defintions. 

Those who do not agree will then be left out of the qualimath and therefore the qualitative solution, from which the quantitative solution can be derived.

As such, qualimath works only for a certain kind of mentality that is able to lower its ego or feeling of the self, to accommodate those of others. 

We say that qualimath is fundamentally expansive and synthetic (prefers synthesis) instead of being analytic and preoccupied with fine details. 

To attain precision, the qualimath can be crudified into normal math. 

We will begin by using Qualimath to solve the Yang Mills Theory by imposing the 5 Elements. This will be given in future posts.
