The previous post explained that the scam theory of Relativity has held back Physics since 1905 through 2 fallacies:

1. Simultaneity of Time Fallacy

This leads to accurate measurements like:
- the precession of Mars
- gravitational lensing
- GPS

But these are useless just as switchin from inches to millimeters is useless. 

This does not explain why light is invariant or why it has a fixed max speed. 

This leads to the Hubble Tension and to junk theories that waste mental effort and funding:
- Supersymmetry
- String Theory
- Loop Quantum Gravity
- Expensive useless Hadron colliders


2. Constant Speed of Light Fallacy

While the first fallacy is a misdirection, this second fallacy is the big bad guy as it directly prevents faster than light travel and levitation. 

This is best seen in the Superluminal Motion hacks to coerce the faster-than-light movement seen in quasars, pulsars, and nova to adhere to Einstien's dogma. 


## The Solution: Idea and Aether 


### 1. The Solution to Simultaneity is to use idea as the measure of time -- keep it subjective, and objective after agreement

Time is a mental object which is best measured by mental idea. 

For example, people can choose what tool they will use to measure time:

- mechanical such as a sand clock or a spring clock
- electromagnetic such as an LCD clock or an atomic clock
- mental such as mental counting or feeling

This also solves the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.


<!-- We call these 2 Fallacies the trap that creates violations of Nature:

1. Relativity uses light as the measure of speed, when "idea" is the real measure.

This unifies space and time as one entity, even if "time" is a superior aethereal object than "space". -->


### 2. The Solution to the Constant Speed of Light: Use the aether to connect the time of distant events 

The aetherspace is the crude physical version of the aether, which now is called:
- dark energy
- atomic space
- gluon field

This aetherspace is the backstage of the physical universe that is invisible to the audience. This connects everything that is on the main stage of physical reality. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/audi.jpg" a="Auditorium" >}}

This explains how masses such as UFOs can teleport, similar to how an actor tunnels through the back stage to emerge on the other side of the stage. 

Relativity eliminates the aether, making faster than light travel impossible.

Spatial (Aethereal) Vortices then explain all of the phenomena explained by Relativity:

Phenomena | Einstein's explanation | Descartes' explanation
--- | --- | ---
Lensing | Warping of spacetime | Rotation of spatial vortex (star, galaxy)
Weak Equivalence | Warping of spacetime | Displacement of space particles from surface of vortex
Mercury Precession | Warping of spacetime | Rotation of sun's vortex
Expansion of Universe | Cosmological Constant | [Sponge Universe](/material/sponge)
Origin of Universe | Big Bang | Eternal Sponge Universe
Superluminal Motion | Light Cone | `c` is just for light in our sun's vortex area 
Wave Particle Duality | Particles are particles and waves | Force particles are waves, non force particles are particles 
Quantum Entangelement | Hidden Variables | Photon spin
Measurement Problem | No Explanation | Universe is an idea which needs mind (also Plato, Berkeley, Schopenhauer)
Distant Galaxies Already Developed | No Explanation | Distant galaxies are not older
Hubble Tension | No Explanation | Heat particles are shorter range than light particles
Gauge Block Wringing | No Explanation | Space Particles exert pressure from outside the gauge blocks
Relativity not matching Quantum Mechanics | No Explanation | Relativity is False. Aether unites Classical and Quantum
Dark Matter | No Explanation | Space particles
Dark Energy | No Explanation | Aetherspace particles
Black Hole Singularity | No Explanation | Singularity is a Spatial Vortex made up of the aetherspace
Arrow of Time | No Explanation | Time particles


<!-- Since the aether is the real cause of gravity and space, Relativity eliminates the possibility of antigravity technologies already seen in UFOs and is essential for fusion -->

<!-- The cause is Einstein pegging the simultaneity of time to the speed of light as Special Relativity simply because light, as c, is constant and invariant in empty space. -->


<!-- ### Absurd Concepts from Relativity

The fallacy of Relativity leads to absurd concepts that have been disproven or are not realizable:

1. Worm holes and white holes that have never been detected 

Relativity uses electromagnetism, as light, which travels in fields. This leads to the fabric of spacetime analogy instead of an all-pervading liquid aether. 

This fabric goes through vortices which then is supposed to  lead to other dimensions. 

This won't work because vortices are aethereal. Going into a vortex will just let you bounce off if you are of a low vibration. 

2. Star Gates

These are artificial wormholes that of course will never work. 

3. Alcubierre Warp Drives

This uses a forward bubble to contract space in the front, and a rear bubble to expand the space in the rear. 

This is hopeless because both distortions require matter creation and destruction where there are none.    -->



<!-- ## Solutions to Destroy the Einstein Trap and Allow Space Manipulation

### Solution to Simultaneity of Time

The fallacy of the simultaneity of time is fixed by tapping into the aetherspace (gluon field) of the spaceship or the heart chakra of the person.

The general idea is to not allow external events to dictate or dominate one's local time. Instead, one's local time is expressed.

1. For Ship Levitation

An AI-driven ship finds its own time signature as the properties of its aetherspace vibration.

This frequency is then compared to the frequency of space above it. 

The aetherspace is then manipulated to match the frequency of that space, leading to levitation.

{{< youtube p1j5D0ma4Ls >}}


2. For Anti Aging

Instead of a person being dictated to earn n dollars by x age, he probes his own heart chakra for his svadharma (gravitational signature). He will then pursue this to be above the usual effects of material vibrations. 



### Solution to Relativity

The fallacy of Relativity is to use the linear or sequential metric tensor to connect distant events. 

We fix this by using Descartes' disjointed time particles as independent moments leading to a flexible 'arrow of time'.

This leads to our conecpt of independent spacetime slices where each 'quantum' of space and time is free from other quanta.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations, Part 3" >}}
A lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others.. The nature of time is different in the time for bringing something into existence, and the time needed to keep a thing existing.      
{{< /q >}}

This is opposed to Einstein's linear space where one metric tensor is dependent on the previous one.  


1. For Ship Levitation

As with levitation, an AI-driven ship finds its own time signature as the properties of its aetherspace vibration.

This frequency is then compared to the frequency of distant stars or planets. 

The aetherspace is then manipulated to match the frequency of those stars or planets, leading to teleportation.
 -->
<!-- This allows both sequential (linear) motion and non-sequential (teleporting) motion by default, with the time particle as the causal mechanism instead of mass or energy.  -->

<!-- This is because the time particle is mostly aethereal in Nature, as being in the upper sublayer of the spatial layer.   -->


<!--  simultaneity of time is fixed by tapping into the aetherspace (gluon field) of the spaceship or the heart chakra of the person.

We unify the time for distant events by using  -->

<!-- We break this trap by using Descartes' Relationality.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 2, Articles 13-15" >}}
A person sitting at the stern might always remain in one place if we look at the parts of the ship, since he preserves the same location with respect to these. On the other hand, if we look at the neighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually changing place. We see him constantly receding from one shore and approaching another. If the earth moves from west to east exactly as the ship moves from east to west, we again say that the person at the stern does not change his place. This is because his place will be determined by certain immovable points in the heavens. I assert that all points are movable in the universe. From this, I conclude that nothing has a permanent place unless it is fixed by our thought.

## So What is Einstein's Relativity Good For?

With the restoration and advances in the aether, Einstein's system becomes totally irrelevant and useless. This is even true for nuclear fission as `E=mc^2` where the aether as cold dark mater can stop hot fission reactions. 

Einstein's Simultaneity and Relativity will be demoted into **a convention for convenience**.

1. Simultaneity 

For example, in the absense of personality profiling, employers can equate age with experience, and so hire older people over younger ones.

2. Relativity

Relativity can still be used by people who want to compute distant outer space phenomena in an antiquated linear or sequential way instead of using teleportation ratios. 

This is similar to how we still use antiquated Roman numerals for numbered bullets like
- I. Topic A
- II. Topic B
- III. Topic C 


<!-- people can choose to use it if they want precision in spatial measurements, like when measuring planetary orbits accurately. -->

<!-- {{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity, Section 8" >}}
Two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously at A and B seen by an observer at the middle. [We thus define time as simultaneity, and define simultaneity as light appearing at the same time.]  <i>It would thus appear that we are reasoning in a logical circle</i>.
{{< /q >}} -->

<!-- > *Newton uses the word 'place' in Principia Mathematica, while he uses an entity called "Lord God" as the source of this time. This is consistent with Superphysics where we call the Mind of God as the Aether -->

<!-- <!-- The movements of everyday objects are quite slow. Usually, distance is just:
- `Spot Z` occupied by the object at timespan now `Time Z`
- `Spot Y` is the distance that it occupied a while ago at `Time Y` (timespan Y)

However, the movement of electromagnetic particles such as light and electricity can be very fast and is faster than what the human brain can process. This is the same cognitive weakness that makes an ego see itself as [one self instead of 3 billion selves](/bio/principles/intro/chapter-04).

{{< n n="*Superphysics aims to use [automated intelligence](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah), combined with [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04b) to build relativistic equations on-the-fly. A true AI is rooted in the aether does not have the weaknesses of human ego. We call this artificial sentience." >}}

{{< n n="*This is done by the Lorentz transformation on the 'moving' part, and Minkowski space on the 'non-moving' part" >}}

### The Illusion of Nature

Speed is the amount of space covered per unit of time. So if you declare speed to be constant, then you must also declare space and time to be changeable*. 

{{< n n="*This is why General Relativity leads to arbitrary make-your-own spacetimes like Godel, Taub-Nut, De Sitter, etc. depending on the fantasy of the physicist and not depending on Nature. In effect, this turns the physicist as a god who uses math as the language of his arbitrary mental movements. He relies on the fact that advanced math (plotting complex mental movements) cannot be understood by most humans who only have ordinary mental movements." >}}


{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/c.png" cap="The observations of classical mechanics (left) can be done with the same observer. Those of special relativity, however, require using a higher c (speed of light) as a tool to unify the observations. This c takes the form of the lasers in the LIGO observatory that is used to observe gravitational waves that 'move' space itself" alt="The speed of light" >}}

Veritasium has the guts to expose the sophistry of Einstein in setting the 2-way speed of light as a constant. However, his solution, as the one-way speed of light, is as arbitrary as the c of Einstein.
