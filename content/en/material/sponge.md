Modern Physics usually visualizes the expanding universe as a dotted balloon that expands, creating bigger distances between its dots. 

However, this is not totally correct since it shows that the dots themselves expand. But galaxies and stars do not expand with the expansion of space.

We fix this by changing the analogy to a sponge that expands when filled with water. This creates a web structure that matches observations.

Moreover, this emphasizes the liquid nature of space which has been proven by LIGO as gravitational waves and by DESI as baryonic acoustic oscillation bubbles. 

This sponge analogy came first from Descartes who connected the expansion and contraction of space to the expansion and contraction of our own abstract minds (souls). This variability then leads to the variations in the idea-objects that our minds can accomodate, such as small ideas and big ideas.

George Berkeley built on this to say that nothing exists without being observed by mind, something proven by quantum mechanics.

Instead of a cosmic web, it would be better to call the universe as a cosmic sponge. This sponge is made up of 2 kinds of spaces: spacetime and aetherspace (Gravity B waves and Gravity A waves to Bob Lazar).

Another sponge structure is the brain which also has these 2 spaces: the normal space for the nerves, and chi or vayu for organic aetherspace. Instead of chi, Descartes uses the words "animal spirits" which came from the Greeks.

In this way, Physics and Biology use the same principles, making it easier to understand how Nature works. 

This is still consistent with Newton's Physics where Newton assigned the cause of gravity to Spirit which is the same mechanism for the nerves.

For example, the sponge pattern in the cosmos is explained by acoustic oscillations or bubbles. The more bubbles, the denser the sponge since these create its matter.

It follows that the complexity of brain is caused by a lot of idea-objects bubbling in the aetherspace of the creature's brain. This then leads to more neural connections, and is why cognitive stimulation is encouraged during brain development.

This means that a cognitive stimulation with high variety is better than a focused one, just as a large multicolored galaxy cluster is more attractive than a small one with bright galaxies.

Moerver, this means that the expansion of the mind leads to the expansion of the universe since the mind and universe are both made of the same aether substance:
- When humans were cavemen, the universe was just a flat Earth with a revolving firmament
- When humans circled the world, the universe extended a little beyond Saturn (the stars were thought to be near Saturn)
- When humans invented large telescopes, the universe started to constantly expand 
- When humans invented space telescopes, the universe started to variably expand 

Hopefully, the mountain of evidence for Cartesian Physics will expose the utter stupidity of Einstein's scam Relativity that is keeping humans stuck on a burning Earth.
