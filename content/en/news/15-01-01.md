After simplifying [The Wealth of Nations](/research/smith/wealth-of-nations/) last year, I started simplifying [The Theory of Moral Sentiments](/research/smith/theory-moral-sentiments/). 

I also started prototyping Adam Smith's economic system in PHP, Groovy, and Ruby, while trying out Graph Databases
