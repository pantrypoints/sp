<!-- Jan 1 |  -->

Smith's ideas are based on Hume, so I started simplifying [A Treatise of Human Nature](/research/hume/treatise/) by David Hume and [The Ethics](/research/spinoza/simple-ethics) by Spinoza (which Hume bashed as hideous). 

I prefer to combine them into a single metaphysical system or paradigm
