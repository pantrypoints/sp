We closed the startup in Saigon in order to move it to Maharlika to test the other implementations of our proposed economic system. 

We've successfully tested the system for services. But using it for goods would need a different business registration as  retail. 

The move to Maharlika is also in line with our push for [Maharlikanism](https://maharlika.superphysics.org}, which is the implementation of our moneyless system through the community (as opposed to as a business).
