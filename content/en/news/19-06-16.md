After finishing [hackathons in August](https://www.pantrypoints.com/news/19-08-30/), we had time to dwell back on the grand theory which will implement Hume's 'Science of Man'. 

Our choices for the name of the theory were:
- 'Superscience'
- 'Suprascience'
- 'Superphysics'
- 'Supraphysics'

We ended up with '[Superphysics](https://medium.com/soranomics/presenting-superphysics-a6119d072520)' because 'science' is relatively new, while 'physics' is much more ancient.

Nov 19 | SORAnomics has been absorbed into Superphysics and renamed into Economic Superphysics or 'Supereconomics'. We put its implementation into [a separate site](https://www.pantrypoints.com) away from Superphysics to split theory from implementation
