Material Superphysics is based on the 5 Layers which match the 3 Elements of Descartes which has been discarded by Modern Physics.

So to bring it back, we use the names of the current Standard Model then associate them with the Cartesian Elements:

- Electromagnetism for the 1st Element
- Spacetime for the 2nd Element
- Strong Force for the 3rd Element

We then convert the Cartesian into Superphysics more easily and seamlessly

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/convert0.png" a="conversion" c="Huygens made a big mistake of naming spacetime as the luminiferous ether. So we use aether with an 'a' to make ours different" >}}

We were hoping that people would have common sense to make the connection intuitively. 

However, we realized that the concepts of Modern Physics has materialist assumptions imbued with them:

- Electromagnetism is based on Maxwell's divergence and curl of fields instead of the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of vortices
- Spacetime is from Einstein who used Minkowski's 4D construct which puts mass as the causal mechanism
- Strong Force is from Yukawa, then Gell-Man, who used the Newtonian forces paradigm instead of the Cartesian Elements paradigm

These assumptions made it hard for people to convert the Standard Model into the Cartesian Elements. 

To solve this, we thought of an intermediate step of introducing filler concepts as other names of the Cartesian Elements:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/convert.png" a="conversion part 2" >}}

We introduce new concepts such as:

1. Aether -- this starts with an "a" instead of an "e" (ether)
2. Space-Time -- this has a dash in the middle, making it differnt from the spacetime of Einstein
3. Electro-light -- this also has a dash. Instead of magnetism, it uses "light" since magnetism is actually done by Space-Time 
4. Weak Conversion Force -- this emphasizes Conversion but keeps "weak" to maintain the association with the weak force of Physics i.e. the weakness is the effect of the force's purpose to convert things -- if it were so strong then it would smash things instead of converting them subtly
5. Strong Material Force -- this emphasizes Material but keeps "strong" to maintain the association with the strong force of Physics i.e. its strength comes from its design to create matter, as materials that persist -- if matter were weak or flexible then our physical reality would be so unstable like a wild theme park ride or a ship beeing tossed by a storm instead of being like solid ground.
