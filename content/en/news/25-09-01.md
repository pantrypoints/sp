The recent fad of quantum computing made us look into Hilbert Space which we replaced with Perception Space to unify Quantum and Classical.

This naturally led to the Identity Space and Existence Space, leading to the overhaul of the Aethereal sublayers.

The ANITA anomaly also made us overhaul the convertible sublayers by putting the ANITA as the Substance of Conversion instead of the neutron. 

Chemistry uses intermolecular forces which we put under the Convertible Layer to bridge Chemistry with Physics just as Existence Space connects Physics to Bio and Spiritual Superphysics
