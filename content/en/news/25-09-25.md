We reorganized the 4 Rules of Movement to match the 4 properties of waves.


Before | After
--- | ---
1 No Void | 1 No Void 
2 State-Change (Inertia) | 2 Straight or Circular
3 Straight or Circular | 3 Collisions
4 Collisions | 4 State-Change


This makes it match the 4 properties of waves which is seen in the 4 laws of thermodynamics

Property | Rule of Motion
--- | ---
1 Continuous Wavelength | 1 No Void  
2 Spin or Frequency | 2 Straight or Circular
3 Spin strength or Wave Amplitude | 3 Collisions 
4 Forward Movement | 4 State-Change


## Replacing Spacetime with Space Particles

Recently, the US Congress has leaked a video of a hellfire missle bouncing off of a UFO. 

This validates the massless aetherspace (Gravity A waves to Bob Lazar) which explains why the detonator of the missle wasn't triggered.

The validation of the masslessness of the aetherspace relative to the mass in the missle lets us confidently separate space particles from time particles, totally undoing Einstein's spacetime hack via Minkowski space. 

Instead of calling them spacetime particles and timespace particles, we call them:
- space particles
- aetherspace particles
- time particles

Technically, their proper 'metaphysical' names should be "distance particles" and "timespan particles". 

However, this would be totally different from modern Physics. 

So instead, we differentiate the MEDIA called space particles from the SUBSTANCE of space by adding the word 'substance' to space substance (i.e. the idea of space in general):

Media | Substance
--- | ---
time (time-span) particle | Time substance 
aetherspace particle | vortex substance (black hole)
space (space-span) particle | Space substance


Time particles (with small 't') facilitate the movement of time whereas the Time substance is the idea of that movement in general, denoted with capital 'T'

Likewise, space particles (with small 's') facilitate the movement of gravity, lensing, surface tension, Van der Waals forces, intermolecular forces, whereas the Space substance is the idea of that movement in space in general, denoted with capital 'S'
