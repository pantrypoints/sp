As Superphysics increased in scope and complexity, we began to use AI videos from the photos of our team members to explain the concepts to give a human connection. 

However, this needed consent of those members each time their images were used for animations. This created a bottleneck. 

So we changed to making pure AI videos. 

We began by making an AI Japanese woman named Sora, from the old name of our SORA or SOcial Resource Allocation.

This lets videos to be made without needing consent.
