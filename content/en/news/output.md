{{< n n="Some blind believers in Einstein ask us what is our output, in their effort to contrast our contributions to those of Einstein whom we assert has killed Physics through his scam Relativity." >}}


The most important output of Superphysics is the eagle, which is our equation for everything. This is packed with:
- the ratio sign which connects everything in existence
- the layers which represent the 5 Elements of Existence
- the gravitational signature which is the inherent idea in everything
- the energy or effort representing the dynamism of existence (and the beligerence of the 2 Forces)

{{< i s="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" a="The eagle" >}} 


Since 2012, various people, aka 'The Team', have been working on Superphysics both as theory and practical implementation. Here, we categorize our output under the different branches.


## Superphysics 

Theories | Description | Year Start
--- | --- | --- 
Superphysics Book | Based on the 2 Forces, 4 Cycles, 5 Elements, and Cartesian Relationality. Built during the pandemic | 2020
Supermath and Qualimath | Supermath is base-6 with new notations to account for Relationality of the lower 3 Elements. Qualimath is base-3 Supermath for the aether | 2020

Implementations or Experiments | Description | Year Start
--- | --- | --- 
True Love | A team member uses Superphysics principles to find true love | 2017
The 5 Layers for Goal Setting | An alternative to SMART goal setting (Specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, time bound) | 2022
