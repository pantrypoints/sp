The caliph, upon assuming power, would appoint governors over the provinces and delegate authority to them. He relied on his lieutenants to manage the affairs of distant regions, entrusting them with responsibilities in accordance with their loyalty and competence.

This delegation was essential for maintaining control over the vast territories of the Abbasid Caliphate. The caliph’s representatives were expected to uphold justice, collect taxes, and ensure security, while remaining accountable to the central authority in Baghdad.

Such appointments were often influenced by political alliances, tribal affiliations, and the strategic importance of the region. The caliph’s ability to govern effectively depended on the strength and reliability of these provincial governors.
