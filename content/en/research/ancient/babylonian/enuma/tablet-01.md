<!-- THE FIRST TABLET -->

{{< n n="The 1st tablet is about the 4 of the 5 Elements" >}}



When in the high heaven was not named and the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,

And the primeval Apsu, who begat them,

And chaos, Tiamut, the mother of them both

Their waters were mingled together,

And no field was formed, no marsh was to be seen.*

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, Apsu is the 1st Element, Mummu is the 4th Element, and Tiamat is the 3rd Element. The 4th Element is connected to the 1st Element and is now called Electroweak Interaction. At this point, there is still no gravitation or 2nd Element. This is why 'no field was formed'" >}}


When of the gods none had been called into being, And none bore a name, and no destinies were ordained.*

{{< n n="*Because there was no spacetime yet*" >}}


Then were created the gods in the midst of heaven, Lahmu and Lahamu were called into being...*


{{< n n="*In Cartesian Physics, the Lahmu is the negative charge, Lahamu is the positive charge" >}}



Ages increased,...

Then Ansar and Kisar were created, and over them....

Long were the days, then there came forth.....

Anu, their son,...
Ansar and Anu...
And the god Anu...

Nudimmud, whom his fathers, his begetters.....

Abounding in all wisdom,...'
He was exceeding strong...
He had no rival -

Thus were established and were... the great gods.

But Tiamat and Apsu were still in confusion... They were troubled and... in disorder...

Apsu was not diminished in might...

And Tiamat roared...

She smote, and their deeds...

Their way was evil...*


{{< n n="Tiamat is evil because the 3rd ELement is the crudest of the 5 Elements" >}}

Then Apsu, the begetter of the great gods, Cried unto Mummu, his minister, and said unto him:

"O Mummu, thou minister that rejoicest my spirit, Come, unto Tiamut let us go!""


So they went and before Tiamat they lay down, They consulted on a plan with regard to the gods, their sons.

Apsu opened his mouth and spake, And unto Tiamut, the glistening one, he addressed the word:
...their way...

By day I can not rest, by night I can not lie down in peace.

But I will destroy their way, I will...

Let there be lamentation, and let us lie down again in peace."


When Tiamat heard these words, She raged and cried aloud...She... grievously...,

She uttered a curse, and unto Apsu she spake:

"What then shall we do? Let their way be made difficult, and let us lie down again in peace."*

Mummu answered, and gave counsel unto Apsu, ...and hostile to the gods was the counsel Mummu gave:

"Come, their way is strong, but you shall destroy it. Then by day shalt you have rest, by night shalt thou lie down in peace."


Apsu harkened unto him and his countenance grew bright,* 

{{< n n="This is light emerging from the 1st Element" >}}


Since he (Mummu) planned evil against the gods his sons.
... he was afraid...,

His knees became weak; they gave way beneath him, Because of the evil which their first-born had planned.

... their... they altered.
... they...,

Lamentation they sat in sorrow.
