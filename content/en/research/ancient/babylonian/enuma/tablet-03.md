Ansar spoke to Gaga, his minister:

"O Gaga, you minister that rejoicest my spirit,
I will I send you unto Lahmu and Lahamu.
... thou canst attain,
... thou shalt cause to be brought before you.
... let the gods, all of them,

Make ready for a feast, at a banquet let them sit,
Let them eat bread, let them mix wine,
That for Marduk, their avenger they may decree the fate.

Go, Gaga, stand before them, and all that I tell thee, repeat unto them, and say:

'Ansar, your son, hath sent me,

The purpose of his heart he hath made known unto me.

He saith that Tiamat our mother hath conceived a hatred for us [and repeated her plot]


<!-- With all her force she rageth, full of wrath.

All the gods have turned to her,
With those, whom ye created, they go at her side.
They are banded together, and at the side of Tiamat they advance;
They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.
They prepare for battle, fuming and raging; -->

<!-- They have joined their forces and are making war.

Ummu-Hubur, who formed all things,
Hath made in addition weapons invincible; she hath spawned monster-serpents,
Sharp of tooth and merciless of fang.
With poison, instead of blood, she hath filled their bodies.

Fierce monster-vipers she hath clothed with terror,
With splendor she hath decked them; she hath made them of lofty stature.
Whoever beboldeth them, terror overcometh him,
Their bodies rear up and none can withstand their attack.
She hath set up vipers, and dragons, and the monster Lahamu,
And hurricanes, and raging bounds, and scorpion-men,
And mighty tempests, and fish-men, and rams;
They bear merciless weapons, without fear of the fight.

Her commands are miahty; none can. resist them;
After this fashion, huge of stature, hath she made eleven monsters.
Among the gods who are her sons, inasmuch as he hath given her support,
She hath exalted Kingu; in their midst she hath raised him to power.
To march before the forces, to lead the host,
To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,
To direct the battle, to control the fight,
Unto him hath she entrusted; in costly raiment she hath made him sit, saying:
I have uttered thy spell; in the assembly of the gods
I have raised thee to power,
The dominion over all the gods have I entrusted unto thee.

Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,
May they magnify thy name over all of them ... the Anunnaki."
She hath given him the Tablets of Destiny, on his breast she laid them, saying:
Thy command shall not be without avail, and the word of thy mouth shall be established."

Now Kingu, thus exalted, having received the power of Anu,
Decreed the fate for the gods, her sons, saving:
Let the opening of your mouth quench the Fire-god;
Whoso is exalted in the battle, let him display his might!" -->


I sent Anu, but he could not withstand her.

Nudimmud was afraid and turned back.

But Marduk hath set out, the director of the gods, your [Enki's] son.

To set out against Tiamat his heart hath prompted him.

He opened his mouth and spake unto me, saying: "If I, your avenger, conquer Tiamat and give you life, appoint an assembly, make my fate preeminent and proclaim it.

In Upsukkinaku seat yourself joyfully together;

With my word in place of you will I decree fate.

May whatsoever I do remain unaltered,

May the word of my lips never be changed nor made of no avail."'

Hasten, therefore, and swiftly decree for him the fate which you bestow,

That he may go and fight your strong enemy.
