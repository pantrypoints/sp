Marduk made the stations for the great gods.

The stars, their images, as the stars of the Zodiac, he fixed.

He ordained the year and into sections he divided it.[]

For the 12 months he fixed 3 stars.

After he had ... the days of the year ... images.

He founded the station of Nibiru [the planet Jupiter] to determine their bounds.*

{{< n n="*Nibiru was a planetoid near Jupiter. In Cartesian Physics, Jupiter is the start of another gravitational territory" >}}


That none might err or go astray, He set the station of Bel and Ea [Enki] along with him.

He opened great gates on both sides, He made strong the bolt on the left and on the right.

In the midst thereof he fixed the zenith.


### The Moon

He caused the god Moon to shine forth, the night he entrusted to him.

He appointed him, a being of the night, to determine the days.

Every month without ceasing with the crown he covered him, saying:


{{< l a="Marduk" >}}
At the beginning of the month, when you shine on the land, you command the horns to determine 6 days, And on the seventh day to divide the crown. On the 14th day thou shalt stand opposite, the half....

And on the ... day you shall stand opposite, and the Sun-god shall... ... to traverse her way.

... you shall cause to draw nigh, and thou shalt judge the right. ... to destroy..."

Then Anu raised the ... in the assembly of the gods. He kissed the bow, saving, " It is...!"

Thus he named the names of the bow, saving, "'Long-wood' shall be one name, and the second name shall be ...,
