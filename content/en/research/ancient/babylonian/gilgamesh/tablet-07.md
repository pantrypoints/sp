In my dream, Anu, Enlil, and Shamash held a council. Anu said to Enlil:	
  
'They killed the Bull of Heaven have also slain Humbaba, the one of them who pulled up the Cedar of the Mountain must die!'	
  
Enlil	said:

'Let Enkidu	die, but Gilgamesh must live.'

  
Then Enlil became angry at Shamash: 'you are responsible because you traveled daily with them as their friend!"'	
  
Enkidu was lying sick in front of Gilgamesh.	
  
His	tears flowing like canals, Gilgamesh said:	
  
"O dear brother, why are they absolving me instead of you?"	
  
"So now I must become a ghost, to sit with the ghosts of the dead, to see my dear brother nevermore! Come, Friend,...The door...	

<!-- Enkidu raised his eyes,...and spoke to the door as if it were human. -->

Gilgamesh:

I will appeal to Enlil. I will make a golden statue for it. 

Enkidu: 

What Enlil says or has laid cannot be taken back. That is the fate of mankind."	
 
Shamash:

"Enkidu, why are you cursing  the harlot, Shamhat, who helped you? 

Enkidu grew calm.
