Bi indicates that (under the conditions which it supposes) there is good fortune. But let (the principal party intended in it) re-examine himself, (as if) by divination, whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firm. If it be so, there will be no error. Those who have not rest will then come to him; and with those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill.

Tuan Zhuan:	
'Bi indicates that there is good fortune:' - (the name) Bi denotes help; (and we see in the figure) inferiors docilely following (their superior). 

'Let (the principal party intended in it) reexamine himself, (as if) by divination, whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firm; - if it be so, there will be no error: - all this follows from the position of the strong line in the centre (of the upper trigram). 'Those who have not rest will come to him:' - high and low will respond to its subject. 'With those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill:' - (for them) the way (of good fortune here indicated) has been exhausted.

Xiang Zhuan:	
(The trigram representing) the earth, and over it (that representing) water, form Bi. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and maintained an affectionate relation to their princes.

Bi:	
The first SIX, divided, shows its subject seeking by his sincerity to win the attachment of his object. There will be no error. Let (the breast) be full of sincerity as an earthenware vessel is of its contents, and it will in the end bring other advantages.

Xiang Zhuan:	
From 'the seeking union with its object' shown in the first SIX, (divided),there will be other advantages.

Bi:	
In the second SIX, divided, we see the movement towards union and attachment proceeding from the inward (mind). With firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'The movement towards union and attachment proceeds from the inward (mind):' - (the party concerned) does not fail in what is proper to himself

Bi:	
In the third SIX, divided, we see its subject seeking for union with such as ought not to be associated with.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'Union is sought with such as ought not to be associated with:' - but will not injury be the result?

Bi:	
In the fourth SIX, divided, we see its subject seeking for union with the one beyond himself. With firm correctness there will be good fortune.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'Union is sought (by the party intended here) with one beyond himself, and (in this case) with a worthy object:' - he is following (the ruler) above him.

Bi:	
The fifth NINE, undivided, affords the most illustrious instance of seeking union and attachment. (We seem to see in it) the king urging his pursuit of the game (only) in three directions, and allowing the escape of all the animals before him, while the people of his towns do not warn one another (to prevent it). There will be good fortune.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'The good fortune belonging to the most illustrious instance of seeking union and attachment' appears in the correct and central position (of the fifth line, undivided). (The king's) neglecting (the animals) confronting him (and then fleeing), and (only) taking those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in his allowing the escape of those in front of him.' 'That the people of his towns do not warn one another (to prevent such escape),' shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them pursue the due course.

Bi:	
In the topmost SIX, divided, we see one seeking union and attachment without having taken the first step (to such an end). There will be evil.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'He seeks union and attachment without taking the first (step to such an end):' - there is no possibility of a (good) issue.
