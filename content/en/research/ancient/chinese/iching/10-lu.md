(Lu suggests the idea of) one treading on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him. There will be progress and success.

Tuan Zhuan:	
In Lu we have (the symbol of) weakness treading on (that of) strength. (The lower trigram) indicates pleasure and satisfaction, and responds to (the upper) indicating strength. Hence (it is said), 'He treads on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him; there will be progress and success.' (The fifth line is) strong, in the centre, and in its correct place. (Its subject) occupies the God-(given) position, and falls into no distress or failure; - (his) action will be brilliant.

Xiang Zhuan:	
(The trigram representing) the sky above, and below it (that representing the waters of) a marsh, form Lu. The superior man, in accordance with this, discriminates between high and low, and gives settlement to the aims of the people.

Lu:	
The first NINE, undivided, shows its subject treading his accustomed path. If he go forward, there will be no error.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'He treads his accustomed path and goes forward:' - singly and exclusively he carries out his (long-cherished) wishes.

Lu:	
The second NINE, undivided, shows its subject treading the path that is level and easy - a quiet and solitary man, to whom, if he be firm and correct, there will be good fortune.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'A quiet and solitary man, to whom, being firm and correct, there will be good fortune:' - holding the due mean, he will not allow himself to be thrown into disorder.

Lu:	
The third SIX, divided, shows a one-eyed man (who thinks he) can see; a lame man (who thinks he) can walk well; one who treads on the tail of a tiger and is bitten. (All this indicates) ill fortune. We have a (mere) bravo acting the part of a great ruler.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'A one-eyed man (who thinks that he) can see:' - he is not fit to see clearly. 'A lame man (who thinks that he can) tread well:' - one cannot walk along with him. 'The ill fortune of being bitten' arises from the place not being the proper one for him. 'A (mere) bravo acting the part of a great ruler:' - this is owing to his aims being (too) violent.

Lu:	
The fourth NINE, undivided, shows its subject treading on the tail of a tiger. He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good fortune.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good fortune:' - his aim takes effect.

Lu:	
The fifth NINE, undivided, shows the resolute tread of its subject. Though he be firm and correct, there will be peril.

Xiang Zhuan:	
'He treads resolutely; and though he be firm and correct, there is peril:' - this is due to his being in the position that is correct and appropriate to him.

Lu:	
The sixth NINE, undivided, tells us to look at (the whole course) that is trodden, and examine the presage which that gives. If it be complete and without failure, there will be great good fortune.

。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'There will be great good fortune,' and that in the occupancy of the topmost line: - this is great matter for congratulation.
