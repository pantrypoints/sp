<sup>1</sup> When Enki had cut off the nations, whose land Enki had given to you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses.

<sup>2</sup> You shall separate 3 cities for you in your land, which Enki had given to you.

<sup>3</sup> You shall prepare yourself a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which Enki gave you to inherit, into 3 parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

10 That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which Enki gave you for an inheritance, and [so] blood be on you.

11} But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities: 12} Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
