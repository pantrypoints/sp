3 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of Enki.

Even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of Enki for ever: 4 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 

5 Nevertheless, Enki would not hearken unto Balaam; but Enki turned the curse into a blessing unto you, because Enki loved you. 6 Do not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days for ever.

7 Do not abhor an Edomite; for he [is] your brother. Do not abhor an Egyptian; because thou
wast a stranger in his land. 8 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of Enki in their third generation. 

9 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.

10 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanced him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 11 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash [himself] with water: and when the sun is
down, he shall come into the camp again.

12 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither you shalt go forth abroad: 13 And you shalt have a paddle upon your weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease yourself abroad, you shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from you: 

14 For Enki walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up thine enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in you, and turn away from you. 

15 Do not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto you: 16 He shall dwell with you, [even] among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of your gates, where it liketh him best: you shalt not oppress him.

17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of Enki for any vow: for even both these [are] abomination unto Enki.

19 Do not charge interest on your fellow Israelite for money, food, or anything that can earn interest. 

20 You may charge foreigners interest. But you must not charge interest on your brother Israelite so that Enki may bless you in all that you do in the land you are entering to possess.

21 When you shalt vow a vow unto Enki your God, you shalt not slack to pay it: for Enki
will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.

22 But if you shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you. 23 That which is gone out of your lips you shalt keep and perform; [even] a free will offering, according as you hast vowed unto Enki, which you hast promised with your mouth.

24 If you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket. 

25 If you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to their standing grain.
