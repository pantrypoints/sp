<sup>1</sup> In the third month, the Israelites came into he wilderness of Sinai.

<sup>2</sup> They left Rephidim, then pitched in the wilderness, and camped before the mount. 

<sup>3</sup> Moses went up to Enki who called to him out of the mountain:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
You shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the Israelites: 

<sup>4</sup> 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I put you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself. 

<sup>5</sup> Now if you will obey me and keep my covenant, then you shall be my treasure above all other people. All of the earth is mine. <sup>6</sup> You shall be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' Say these to the Israelites.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>7</sup> Moses told the elders what Enki commanded him.

<sup>8</sup> They replied:

{{< r a="Elders" >}}
We will do all that Enki had said. 
{{< /r >}}

Moses returned their words to Enki. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>9</sup> I come to you in a thick cloud so that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever. 
{{< /l >}}

Moses told the words of the people to Enki.


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>10</sup> Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow. Let them wash their clothes. <sup>11</sup> Be ready for the third day when Enki will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai. <sup>12</sup> Set bounds on the people round about, saying: 

'Do not go up into the mountain or touch its border. Whosoever touches the mount shall be put to death. <sup>13</sup> Anyone who touches it will be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man, it shall not live. When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>14</sup> Moses went down from the mount and sanctified the people. They then washed their clothes.

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
<sup>15</sup> People, Be ready on the third day. Do not have sex with your wives.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>16</sup> On the morning of the third day, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the sound of the trumpet exceedingly loud. All the people that was in the camp trembled.

<sup>17</sup> Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with Enki.

They stood at the foot of the mount. 

<sup>18</sup> Mount Sinai was completely enveloped by smoke, because Enki descended on it in fire. Its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mountain shook greatly. 

<sup>19</sup> When the sound of the trumpet became long and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke and Enki answered him.

<sup>20</sup> Enki came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount. He called Moses up to the top of the mount. So Moses went up. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>21</sup> Go down and warn the people not to break through to look at Enki, as many of them may perish. <sup>22</sup> Even the priests who come near to Enki must sanctify themselves or else Enki will break out on them. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
<sup>23</sup> The people cannot come up to mount Sinai because you warned us, saying: 'Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.' 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>24</sup> Go down and bring up Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up unto Enki, lest Enki break out on them. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>25</sup> So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.
