{{< r a="Moses" >}}
<sup>1</sup> Enki said the following:
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup>  I am the Lord your alien-god, who have brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 

<sup>3</sup> Do not have other alien-gods besides me.

<sup>4</sup> Do not make idols for yourselves whether in  the shape of anything in the heavens above or the earth below or in the waters of the earth.

<sup>5</sup> Do not bow down to them, nor serve them: for I, Enki, am a jealous alien-god, punishing the children for their father's iniquity to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me.* 
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="The jealous nature of Enki is well documented in the Sumerian text 'Enki and Ninhursaja'. The great civilizations of Sumer, Babylonia, Egypt, and Greece belonged to his big brother Enlil. And so Enki had to make do with the tiny civilizations of the Jews and Arabs. Those allied with Enlil hated Enki. So the first commanments are all about Enki's ego." >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>6</sup>  But I show mercy to thousands of them who love me, and keep my commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> Do not take my name in vain. I will punish those who takes my name in vain. 

<sup>8</sup> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>9</sup> Do all your work for 6 days. <sup>10</sup> But the seventh day is the sabbath of Enki when you, your son, daughter, servants, cattle, nor foreigners who are within your gates.

<sup>11</sup> This is because we Anunnaki made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them in 6 days and rested the 7th day. And so I declare the sabbath day holy. 

<sup>12</sup> Honour your father and mother so that you may have a long life in the land which Enki has given to you. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>13</sup> Do not kill. <sup>14</sup> Do not commit adultery. <sup>15</sup> Do not steal.

<sup>16</sup> Do not bear false witness against your neighbour.

<sup>17</sup> Do not covet your neighbour’s house, wife, servants, oxen, ass, nor anything is his.
{{< /l >}}



<sup>18</sup> All the people saw the thunder, lightning, noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. And so they moved and stood far away. 


<sup>19</sup> They said to Moses:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Speak to us, and we will listen. But do not let Enki speak with us, or else we will die. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
<sup>20</sup> Do not fear. For Enki has come to test you, so that you will fear him and will not sin. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>21</sup> The people still stood far away. Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where Enki was.

<sup>22</sup> Enki said to Moses:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Tell the Israelites: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven. <sup>23</sup> Do not make alien-gods of silver to rival me. Do not make alien-gods of gold for yourselves.

<sup>24</sup> Make an altar of earth for me. Sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your flocks and herds. In all places where I record my name I will come to you and bless you.

<sup>25</sup> If you make a stone altar for me, do not nake it from cut stones. Because if you use your chisel on it, then you will pollute it. 

<sup>26</sup> Do not go up by steps to my altar, so that your nakedness is not exposed on it.
