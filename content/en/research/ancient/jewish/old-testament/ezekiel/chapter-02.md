<sup>1</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, stand up.

<sup>2</sup> The spirit entered into me when he spoke to me and set me on my feet.


<!-- , that I heard him that spake unto me.  -->

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>3</sup> Son of man, I send you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that had rebelled against me.

They and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day. 

<sup>4</sup> They are impudent children and stiffhearted. 

Tell them <sup>5</sup> whether they will hear or not(for they are a rebellious house) yet shall know that there had been a prophet among them.

<sup>6</sup> Do not be afraid of them or their words even if briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. 

Do not be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 

<sup>7</sup> Speak my words to them, whether they will hear or not. For they [are] most rebellious. <sup>8</sup> But do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.

<sup>9</sup>  When I looked, a hand was sent to me. A roll of a book was therein. <sup>10</sup> He spread it before me. It was written within and without. It had lamentations, mourning, and woe.
