<sup>13</sup> [To Ezekiel] Turn you yet again, [and] you shalt see greater abominations that they do.

<sup>14</sup> Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Enki’S house which was towards the north. Behold, there sat
women weeping for Tammuz.


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>15</sup> [To Ezekiel] Have you seen this, O son of man? There are greater abominations than these.

16 He brought me into the inner court of his house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of Enki, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men, with their backs toward the temple of Enki, and their faces toward the east. They worshipped the sun toward the east.

<sup>15</sup> [To Ezekiel] Have you seen [this,] O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 

18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, [yet] will I not hear them.

1 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man [with] his destroying weapon in his hand.

2 Six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: They went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. 

3 The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which [had] the writer’s inkhorn by his side; 9:4} And Enki said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

5 To the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eyou spare, neither have you pity: 

6 Slay utterly old [and] young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom [is] the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which [were] before the house. 

7 He said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.

8 It came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury upon Jerusalem?

9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the Israelites and Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and Enki seeth not. 

10 As for me also, mine eyou shall not spare, neither will I have pity, [but] I will recompense their way upon their head.

11 the man clothed with linen, which [had] the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you hast commanded me.
