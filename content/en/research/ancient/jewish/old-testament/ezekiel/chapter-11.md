<sup>1</sup> The spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Enki’s house, which looketh eastward.

At the door of the gate were 25 men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, these are the men who devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this  city: {11:3} Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh. {11:4} Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son
of man.

<sup>5</sup> The Spirit of Enki fell on me saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Israelites, I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them. 

<sup>6</sup> Ye have:
- multiplied your slain in this city
- filled its streets with the slain

<sup>7</sup> Your slain are the flesh, and this city is the caldron. But I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 

<sup>8</sup> You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you.

<sup>9</sup> I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

<sup>10</sup> Ye shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. You shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>11</sup> This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel

<sup>12</sup> You shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you.

<sup>13</sup> While I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. 

Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said:

{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
Lord Enki! wilt you make a full end of the remnant of Israel? 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>14</sup> The word of Enki came unto me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Son of man, your brethren, [even] your brethren, the men of your kindred, and all the Israelites wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Enki: unto us is this land given in possession. {11:16} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Enki.

Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. 

<sup>17</sup> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

<sup>18</sup> They shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 

<sup>19</sup> I will:
- give them one heart
- put a new spirit within you
- take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh

<sup>20</sup> They may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them. They shall be my people, and I will be their God.

<sup>21</sup> But as for those whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads

<sup>22</sup> Then the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them.

The glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

<sup>23</sup> The glory of Enki went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city. 

<sup>24</sup> Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

<sup>25</sup> Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Enki had shewed me.
