<sup>1</sup> In year 7, month 5, day 10, certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of Enki, and sat before me.

<sup>2</sup> Then came the word of Enki unto me, saying:

<sup>3</sup> Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith Enki; Are you come to enquire of me? [As] I live, saith Enki, I will not be enquired of by you.

<sup>4</sup> Wilt you judge them, son of man, wilt you judge [them?] cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:

<sup>5</sup> Say to them, Thus saith Enki; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord;

<sup>6</sup> In the day [that] I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands: <sup>7</sup> Then said I unto them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me.

They did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt.

Then I said: I will pour out my fury on them to accomplish my anger against them in Egypt.  

But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in
whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of Egypt.

<sup>10</sup> Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the and of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

<sup>11</sup> I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.

<sup>12</sup> I also gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Enki that sanctify them. 

<sup>13</sup> But the Israelites rebelled against me in the wilderness.

They walked not in my statutes. They despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them. My sabbaths they greatly polluted. Then I said, I would pour out my fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
 

<sup>14</sup> But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.

<sup>15</sup> Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given [them,] flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands.

<sup>16</sup> Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

<sup>17</sup> Nevertheless mine eyou spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

<sup>18</sup> But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 

<sup>19</sup> I am the Lord. Walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them.

<sup>20</sup> Hallow my sabbaths. They shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord.

<sup>21</sup> The children rebelled against me. They walked not in my statutes.

They did not keep my judgments to do them, which if they did, they would even live in them.

They polluted my sabbaths. Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. 

<sup>22</sup> Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

<sup>23</sup> I lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries.

<sup>24</sup> Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols. 

<sup>25</sup> Wherefore I gave them also statutes [that were] not good, and judgments whereby they should not live.

<sup>26</sup> I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord.

<sup>27</sup> Therefore, son of man, speak unto the Israelites, and say unto them, Thus saith Enki; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. 

<sup>28</sup> For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees. 

They offered there their sacrifices. There they presented the provocation of their offering.

There also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.

<sup>29</sup> Then I said to them, What is the high place where you are going to?

The name thereof is called *Bamah* to this day. 

<sup>30</sup> Say to the Israelites, Thus said Enki; Are you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit you whoredom after their abominations? 

<sup>31</sup> For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? 

As I live, saith Enki, I will not be enquired of by you.

<sup>32</sup> That which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

<sup>33</sup> [As] I live, saith Enki, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you: 

<sup>34</sup> I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. 

<sup>35</sup> I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.

<sup>36</sup> Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith Enki.

<sup>37</sup> I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant: <sup>38</sup> I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>39</sup> Enki said:

Go ye, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter [also,] if you will not hearken unto me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. 

<sup>40</sup> For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith Enki, there shall all the Israelites, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

<sup>41</sup> I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein you have been scattered;

I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 

<sup>42</sup> You shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country [for] the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. 

<sup>43</sup> There shall you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and you shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed. 


<sup>44</sup> You shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, saith Enki.

<sup>45</sup> Moreover the word of Enki came unto me, saying: <sup>46</sup> Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.

<sup>47</sup> Say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of Enki; 

Thus saith Enki: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

<sup>48</sup> All flesh shall see that I Enki have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

<sup>49</sup> Then said I, Ah Lord Enki! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?
