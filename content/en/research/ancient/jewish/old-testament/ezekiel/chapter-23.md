<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: {23:3} And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they
bruised the teats of their virginity. 

<sup>4</sup> Their names were:
- Aholah the elder
- Aholibah her sister

They were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 

<sup>5</sup> Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbours, <sup>6</sup> [Which were] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 

<sup>7</sup> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them [that were] the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself. 

<sup>8</sup> Neither left she her whoredoms [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 

<sup>9</sup> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

<sup>10</sup> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

<sup>11</sup> When her sister Aholibah saw [this,] she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in [her] whoredoms.

<sup>12</sup> She doted upon the Assyrians [her] neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

<sup>13</sup> Then I saw that she was defiled.

They took both one way, <sup>14</sup> and she increased her whoredoms. For when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, <sup>15</sup> girded with girdles on their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity.

<sup>16</sup> As soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 

<sup>17</sup> The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love. 

They defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. 

<sup>18</sup> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.

<sup>19</sup> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 

<sup>20</sup> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh [is as] the flesh of asses, and whose issue [is like] the issue of horses. 

<sup>21</sup> Thus you calledst to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in bruising your teats by the Egyptians for the paps of your youth.

<sup>22</sup> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith Enki: Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated.

I will bring them against you on every side: <sup>23</sup> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses. 

<sup>24</sup> They shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, [which] shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about.

I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments. 

<sup>25</sup> I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and thine ears.

Your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire. 

<sup>26</sup> They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels. 

<sup>27</sup> Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt: so that you shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 

<sup>28</sup> For thus saith Enki: Behold, I will deliver you into the hand [of them] whom you hatest, into the hand [of them] from whom your mind is alienated.

<sup>29</sup> They shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labour, and shall leave you naked and bare. 

The nakedness of your whoredoms shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your whoredoms. 

<sup>30</sup> I will do these things unto you, because you hast gone a whoring after the heathen, [and] because you art polluted with their idols.

<sup>31</sup> You hast walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.

<sup>32</sup> Thus saith Enki:

You shalt drink of your sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. 

<sup>33</sup> You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.

<sup>34</sup> You shalt even drink it and suck [it] out, and you shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken [it,] saith Enki.


<sup>35</sup> Therefore thus saith Enki; Because you hast forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your whoredoms.

<sup>36</sup> Enki said moreover to me: Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah?

Yes, declare to them their abominations.

<sup>37</sup> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.

<sup>38</sup> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. 

<sup>39</sup> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it.

Thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

<sup>40</sup> Furthermore, that you have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent.

And they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments, <sup>41</sup> satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you had set my incense and oil.

<sup>42</sup> A voice of a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of the common sort [were] brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. 

<sup>43</sup> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries: Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she [with them?

<sup>44</sup> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.

<sup>45</sup> The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands. 

<sup>46</sup> For thus said Enki: I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

<sup>47</sup> The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 

<sup>48</sup> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

<sup>49</sup> They shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I [am] the Lord.
