<sup>1</sup> In the year 9, month 10, day 10, I heard Enki saying to me:


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Son of man, write you the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

<sup>3</sup> Utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith Enki; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it.

<sup>4</sup> Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones.

<sup>5</sup> Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and] make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.

<sup>6</sup> Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum [is] not gone out of it! 

Bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.

<sup>7</sup> For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 

<sup>8</sup> That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore thus saith Enki; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>10</sup> Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. 

<sup>11</sup> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed. 

<sup>12</sup> She hath wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum [shall be] in the fire. 

<sup>13</sup> In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you wast not purged, you shalt not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you. 

<sup>14</sup> I Enki have spoken it: 

I will do it. I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, saith Enki.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
15-16 Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou
mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. 

17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon you, and put on your shoes upon your feet, and cover not [your] lips, and eat not the bread of men. 18} So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

{{< r a="Israelites" >}}
19 [To Ezekiel] Tell us what these things are to us that you do? 
{{< /r >}}

<sup>20</sup> The word of Enki came to me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>21</sup> Tell them that I said: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.

<sup>22</sup> You shall do as I have done: you shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men.

<sup>23</sup> Your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 

<sup>24</sup> Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall you do: and when this cometh, you shall know that I am the Lord. 

<sup>25</sup> Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, <sup>26</sup> } That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto you, to cause [you] to hear [it] with [thine] ears?

<sup>27</sup> In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and you shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
