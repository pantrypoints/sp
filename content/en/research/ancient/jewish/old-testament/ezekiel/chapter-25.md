<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them.

<sup>3</sup> Tell the Ammonites, Hear the word of Enki:

Because you said:
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ammonites" >}}
Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>4</sup> Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. 

<sup>5</sup> I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and you shall
know that I am the Lord.

<sup>6</sup> Enki said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Because you hast clapped [thine] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your despite against the land of Israel; 

<sup>7</sup> So I will stretch out mine hand upon you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries.

I will destroy you; and you shalt know that I am the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the heathen.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities [which are] on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal- meon, and Kiriathaim, <sup>10</sup> Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.


<sup>11</sup> I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>12</sup> Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 

<sup>13</sup> I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman.

They of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 14} And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel.

They shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith Enki.

<sup>15</sup> Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred.

<sup>16</sup> Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

<sup>17</sup> I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
