{{< l a="Enki" >}}
1-2 [To Ezekiel] Son of man, tell the prince of Tyrus that Enki said that his heart is arrogant and he has said that he is a God and sit in the seat of God in the midst of the seas.

Yet he is a man, not God [alien]. 

He has set his heart as the heart of God [alien]. 

<sup>3</sup> He is wiser than Daniel. There is no secret that they can hide from him. 

<sup>4</sup> With his wisdom and understanding he has gotten riches, gold and silver as treasures. 

5 By his great wisdom and traffic his riches have increased, and his heart is made arrogant by his riches.

<!-- Because you hast set thine heart as the heart of God; -->
6-7 And so I will bring terrible foreigners to him. They shall draw their swords against the beauty of his wisdom and defile his brightness. 

8 They shall bring him down to the pit, and you shalt die the deaths of [them that are] slain in the midst of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> Will you yet say before him that slayeth you, I [am] God? but you [shalt be] a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth you. 

<sup>10</sup> You shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken [it,]

11-12 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith Enki; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 

<sup>13</sup> You have been in Eden the garden of God.

Every precious stone [was] your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that thou wast created.

<sup>14</sup> You are the anointed cherub that covered.

I have set you [so:] you wast upon the holy mountain of God; you hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 

<sup>15</sup> You were perfect in your ways from the day that you wast created, till iniquity was found in you. 

<sup>16</sup> By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the midst of you with violence, and you hast sinned.

Therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 

<sup>17</sup> Yourheart was lifted up because of your beauty, you hast corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness: I will cast you to the ground, I will lay you before kings, that they may behold you. 

<sup>18</sup> You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of your traffick.

Therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold you. 

<sup>19</sup> All they that know you among the people shall be astonished at you: you shalt be a terror, and never [shalt] you [be] any more.

<sup>20-21</sup> Son of man, set your face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, <sup>22</sup> Say:

Enki said: Behold, I [am] against you, O Zidon.

I will be glorified in the midst of you: and they shall know that I am Enki, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

<sup>23</sup> For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her street.

The wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword on her on every side; and they shall know that I [am] the
LORD.

<sup>24</sup> There shall be no more a pricking brier unto the Israelites, nor [any] grieving thorn of all [that are] round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord. 

<sup>25</sup> Thus said Enki: When I shall have gathered the Israelites from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 

<sup>26</sup> They shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards.

They shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their [alien] God.
