<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.

3 Say to it: Enki said: Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you. I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will
make you most desolate.

4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shalt be desolate, and you shalt know that I am the Lord.  

5 Because you have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed the blood of the Israelites by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end.

6 Therefore, as I live, I will prepare you to blood, and blood shall pursue you: sith you hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you. 

7 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 

8 I will fill his mountains with his slain [men:] in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 

9 I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not return: and you shall know that I am the Lord.

10 Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Enki was there:

11 Therefore, as I live, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which you hast used out of your hatred against them.

I will make myself known among them, when I have judged you.

12 I have heard all your blasphemies which you hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.  

<sup>13</sup> Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

<sup>14</sup> When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make you desolate. 

<sup>15</sup> As you didst rejoice at the inheritance of the Israelites, because it was desolate, so will I do unto you.

You shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
