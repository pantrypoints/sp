<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him

<sup>3</sup> Say that I said: Behold I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal

<sup>4</sup> I will turn you back, and put hooks into your jaws.

I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords

- <sup>5</sup> Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them, all of them with shield and helmet
- <sup>6</sup> Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with you. 

<sup>7</sup> You and all your company that are assembled unto you should be prepared and be a guard unto them. 

<sup>8</sup> After many days you shall be visited.

In the latter years, you shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste.

But it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.

<sup>9</sup> You shall ascend and come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all your bands, and many people with you. 

<sup>10</sup> At the same time things shall come into your mind. You shall think an evil thought.

<sup>11</sup> You shall say:

{{< r a="Prince of Meshech and Tubal" >}}
I will go up to the land of unwalled villages. I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely.

All of them are dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates.

<sup>12</sup> I will:
- take a spoil
- take a prey
- turn your hand on the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>13</sup> Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say to you:

{{< r a="Merchants" >}}
Have you come to take a spoil? Have you gathered your company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>14</sup> Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith Enki; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt you not know it?

<sup>15</sup> You shalt come from your place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with you, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 

<sup>16</sup> You shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days.

I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.

<sup>17</sup> Are you he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days [many] years that I would bring you against them?

<sup>18</sup> In time, Gog shall come against the land of Israel, and my fury shall come up in my face.

<sup>19</sup> For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel

<sup>20</sup> So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth. 

All the men that are on the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

<sup>21</sup> I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains. Every man’s sword shall be against his brother. 

<sup>22</sup> I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood. I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

<sup>23</sup> Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
