<sup>7</sup> Enlil formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

<sup>8</sup> Enlil planted a garden eastward in Eden. There he put the man whom he had formed.

<sup>9</sup> Out of the ground, Enlil made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. This included:
- the tree of life also in the midst of the garden
- the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 

<sup>10</sup> A river went out of Eden to water the garden. From thence it was parted, and became into 4 heads.

<sup>11</sup> The name of the first is Pison. It compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup>12</sup> The gold* of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

{{< n n="The Annunaki chose Eden as their main production site within 'Havilah' because it had the gold that they needed" >}}

<sup>13</sup> The name of the second river is Gihon: it compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.

<sup>14</sup> The name of the third river is Hiddekel: it goes towards the east of Assyria. The
fourth river is Euphrates.

<sup>15</sup> Enlil took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress and keep it.

<sup>16</sup> Enlil commanded the man, saying:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
You can freely eat of every tree of the garden. <sup>17</sup> But do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat it, you shall surely die on that day. <sup>18</sup> It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make a helper for him.

<sup>19-20</sup> Out of the ground, Enlil formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.


<!-- <sup>20</sup> Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the
field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. -->

<sup>21</sup> Enlil put Adam to a deep sleep. He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh.

<sup>22</sup> From the rib, Enlil made a woman, and brought her unto the man.

<sup>23</sup> Adam said:

{{< l a="Adam" >}}
This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>24</sup> Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

<sup>25</sup> They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
