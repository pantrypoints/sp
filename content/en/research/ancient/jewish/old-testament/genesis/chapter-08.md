<sup>1</sup> Enki remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: 

Enki made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 

<sup>2</sup> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.

<sup>3</sup> The waters returned from off the earth continually and were abated after the end of the 150 days. 

<sup>4</sup> The ark rested on month 7, on day 17 on the mountains of Ararat. 

<sup>5</sup> The waters decreased continually until month 10, day 1 when the tops of the mountains were seen.

<sup>6</sup> At the end of 40 days, Noah opened the window of the ark

<sup>7</sup> He sent out a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

<sup>8</sup> He sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated.

<sup>9</sup> But the dove found no rest. She returned to the ark. 

<!-- , for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and
pulled her in unto him into the ark.  -->

<sup>10</sup> After 7 days, he again he sent out the dove. <sup>11</sup> It returned in the evening with an olive leaf pluckt off.

So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 

<sup>12</sup> After another 7 days he sent out the dove which did not return anymore.

<sup>13</sup> In the 601th year, in month 1, day 1, the waters were dried up from off the earth.

Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 

<sup>14</sup> In month 2, day 27, the earth dried.

<sup>15</sup> Enki told Noah:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>16</sup> Go out of the ark with your wife, sons, their wives. <sup>17</sup> Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you, of all flesh, both of bird and cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>18</sup> Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.

<sup>19</sup> Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

<sup>20</sup> Noah built an altar for Enki. He took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

<sup>21</sup> Enlil smelled a sweet savour and said in his heart:

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake. For the imagination of man’s heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.  <sup>22</sup> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
