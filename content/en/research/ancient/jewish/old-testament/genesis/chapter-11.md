<sup>1</sup> The whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. 

<sup>2</sup> As they journeyed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sumer and lived there. 

<sup>3</sup> They said one to another:

"Let us make brick, and burn them throughly."

They had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 

<sup>4</sup> Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach heaven. Let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth. 

<sup>5</sup> Enlil came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded and said:

<sup>6</sup> Behold, the people are one. They have all one language. This they begin to do. Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

<sup>7</sup> Let us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. 

<sup>8</sup> So Enlil scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. They
left off to build the city. <sup>9</sup> It was called Babel because Enlil there confounded the language of all the earth. From there, Enlil scattered them abroad on the face of all the earth.

<sup>10</sup> These are the generations of Shem: Shem [was] 100 years old, and begat Arphaxad 2 years after the flood.

<sup>11</sup> Shem begat Arphaxad at 500 years, and begat sons and daughters.

<sup>12</sup> Arphaxad lived 530 years, and begat Salah <sup>13</sup> at 403 years, and begat sons and daughters.

<sup>14</sup> Salah lived 30 years, and begat Eber.

{11:15} And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>16</sup> Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.

{11:17} Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
years, and begat sons and daughters. {11:18} And Peleg
lived thirty years, and begat Reu: {11:19} And Peleg lived
after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 

<sup>20</sup> Reu lived 32 years, and begat Serug: {11:21} And Reu lived after he
begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons
and daughters.

<sup>22</sup> Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: {11:23} And Serug lived after he begat Nahor
two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

{11:24} Nahor lived 920 years, and begat Terah:

{11:25} Nahor lived after he begat Terah 119 years, and begat sons and daughters. {11:26}
And Terah lived 70 years, and begat Abram, Nahor,
and Haran.

{11:27} These are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

{11:28} Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. 

{11:29} Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai. Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

{11:30} But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child.

{11:31} Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife.

They went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan.

They came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 

{11:32} And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
