<sup>1</sup> In the days of Amraphel king of Sumer, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of
Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 

<sup>2</sup> These made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 

<sup>3</sup> All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 

<sup>4</sup> For 12 years they served Chedorlaomer. In the 13th year they rebelled.

<sup>5</sup> In the 14th year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him. He defated:
- the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim
- the Zuzims in Ham
- the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim 
- <sup>6</sup> the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which [is] by the wilderness.

<sup>7</sup> They returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh. They defeated all the country of:
- the Amalekites, and
- the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar. 

<sup>8</sup> There went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar;).

They joined battle with them in the valley of Siddim.

<sup>9</sup> With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Sumer, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. 

<sup>10</sup> The valley of Siddim was full of slimepits. The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there. The rest fled to the mountain. 

<sup>11</sup> They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 

<sup>12</sup> They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

<sup>13</sup> And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these [were] confederate with Abram.

<sup>14</sup> When Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan. 

<sup>15</sup> He divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and defeated them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 

<sup>16</sup> He brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

<sup>17</sup> The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king’s dale.

<sup>18</sup> Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. 

<sup>19</sup> He blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of Enki, possessor of heaven and earth: 

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be Enki which had delivered your enemies into your hand.

He gave him tithes of all. 

<sup>21</sup> The king of Sodom said to Abram:

Give me the persons, and take the goods to yourself. 

<sup>22</sup> Abram replied:

I have lifted up my hand to Enki, the possessor of heaven and earth <sup>23</sup> so that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is yours, lest you shoulde say, I have made Abram rich: 

<sup>24</sup> Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
