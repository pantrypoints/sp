<sup>1</sup> When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau
his eldest son, and said unto him:

<sup>2</sup> I am old, I know not the day of my death: 

<sup>3</sup> Take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me [some] venison. <sup>4</sup> Make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you
before I die. 

<sup>5</sup> Rebekah heard this, Esau went to the field to hunt for venison.

<sup>6</sup> Rebekah told Jacob her son

I heard your father speak to Esau <sup>7</sup> to bring him venison and make him a savoury meat so that he can bless him before Enki before his death. 

<sup>8-9</sup> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loveth.

<sup>10</sup> You shall bring it to your father for him to eat and bless you before his death. 


{{< r a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>11</sup> Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 12 My father will feel me. I shall seem to him as a deceiver and bring a curse on me, not a blessing. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Rebekah" >}}
13 Your curse will be on me. Obey me, and go fetch me the goats.
{{< /r >}}


14 He went and brought them to his mother who then made savoury meat that his father loved.

15 Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which [were] with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.

16 She put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and on the smooth of his neck: {27:17} And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

18 He came to his father, and said:

My father, here I am 


Who are you, my son? 

{27:19} 

Jacob said unto his father, I [am] Esau your firstborn; I have done according as you badest me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.

20 Isaac said:

How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? 

{{< r a="Jacob" >}}
Because Enki brought it to me. 
{{< /r >}}


21 Come near so that I may feel you whether you are Esau or not.

22 Jacob went near to Isaac who felt him and said:

The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 23 He discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him. 

24 Are you my son Esau? 

I am.

25 Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.

He brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 

26 Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 

27 He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Enki had blessed: 

28 Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: {27:29}

Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brethren, and let your mother’s sons bow down to you: cursed [be] every one that curseth you, and blessed be he that blesseth you.

30 As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, Esau came in from his hunting.

<!--  and Jacob was yet scarce gone out
from the presence of Isaac his father, that   -->

31 He also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said to his father:

Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me. 

{27:32} Isaac asked him: Who are you?

I [am] your son, your firstborn Esau. 


33 Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said:

Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and I have eaten of all before you camest, and have blessed him? 

yea, [and] he shall be blessed. 

34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father:

Bless me also, O my father.

35 Your brother came with subtilty, and had taken away your blessing. 

36 Was it Jacob? He had supplanted me these 2 times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.

Have you not reserved a blessing for me? 


37 I have made him your lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto you, my son?

38 Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father.

Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 

39 Your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.

40 By your sword shall you live, and shalt serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shalt have the dominion, that you shalt break his yoke from off your neck.

41 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 

42 These words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah.

She sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill you. 

43 Flee to Laban my brother to Haran; {27:44} And tarry with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turn away; 

45 Until your brother’s anger turn away from you, and he forget [that] which you hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

46 Rebekah said to Isaac:

I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [which are] of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
