<sup>1</sup> Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said:

You shall not take marry any of the daughters of Canaan. 


<sup>2</sup> Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take you a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 

<sup>3</sup> Enki bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you mayest be a
multitude of people.

<sup>4</sup> Give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you mayest inherit the land wherein you art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. {28:5} And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.

<sup>6</sup> When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

<sup>7</sup> Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram; {28:8} And Esau
seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; {28:9} Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.


<sup>10</sup> Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.

<sup>11</sup> He lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and [put] them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

<sup>12</sup> He dreamed of a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the agents of Enki ascending and descending on it.

<sup>13</sup> Enki stood above it and said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I am the Lord of Abraham your father and the Enki of Isaac: I will give to you and your seed the land where you are now on. {28:14} Your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 

{28:15} I am with you and will keep you in all [places] whither you goest, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done [that] which I have spoken to you of.

<sup>16</sup>  Jacob woke up and said:

Surely Enki is in this place; and I knew it not. 

<sup>17</sup>  He was afraid, and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven.

<sup>18</sup> Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put [for] his pillows, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 

<sup>19</sup> He called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city [was called] Luz at the first. 

<sup>20</sup> Jacob vowed saying:

If Enki will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, {28:21} So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the Enki: {28:22} This stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shall be Enki's house: and of all that thou
shalt give me I will surely give the tenth to you.
