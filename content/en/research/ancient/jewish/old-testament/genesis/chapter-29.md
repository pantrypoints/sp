<sup>1</sup> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 

<sup>2</sup> He looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were 3 flocks of sheep lying by it. Out of that well they watered the flocks. A great stone was on the well’s mouth.

<sup>3</sup> There were all the flocks gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in his place. 

<sup>4</sup> Jacob said to them:


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
My brethren, where are you from?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Men" >}}
We are from Haran
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>5</sup> Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Men" >}}
Yes, we know him
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>6</sup> Is he well?
{{< /l >}}

[He is] well: 

Laban's daughter Rachel came with the sheep. 

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>7</sup> It is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water the sheep, and go feed them.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Men" >}}
<sup>8</sup> We cannot do that until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we can water the sheep.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>9</sup> Rachel then came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them. 

<sup>10</sup> When Jacob saw Rachel and her sheep, he went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban.

<!-- the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob 

 his mother’s brother.  -->

<sup>11</sup> Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. <sup>12</sup> He told Rachel that:
- he was her father’s brother
- he was Rebekah’s son

She ran and told her father. 

<!-- his sister’s son, -->
<sup>13</sup> When Laban heard news of Jacob, he ran to meet him.

He embraced and kissed Jacob and brought him to his house.
 <!-- And he told Laban all these things.  -->

{{< r a="Laban" >}}
<sup>14</sup> You are my bone and my flesh
{{< /r >}}

Jacob lived with Laban for 1 month.

{{< r a="Laban" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Because you are my brother. Should you serve me for nothing? How much are your wages?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>16</sup> Laban had 2 daughters: 

1. The elder was Leah
2. The younger was Rachel

<sup>17</sup> Leah was tender eyed. But Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

<sup>18</sup> Jacob loved Rachel and said:

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
I will serve you 7 years for Rachel your younger daughter. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Laban" >}}
<sup>19</sup> It is better that I give her to you than to another man: live with us. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>20</sup> Jacob served 7 years for Rachel. It seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for Rachel.


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
<sup>21</sup> [To Laban:] Give me my wife for my days are fulfilled, that I may have sex with her. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>22</sup> Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 

<sup>23</sup> In the evening, he took Leah his daughter and had sex with her.

<sup>24</sup> Laban gave Zilpah his maid as a handmaid to his daughter Leah. 

<sup>25</sup> In the morning, it was Leah. He said to Laban:

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
What have you done to me? Did I not serve you so I could make a baby with Rachel? Why have you beguiled me? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Laban" >}}
<sup>26</sup> In our country, we do not give the younger before the firstborn.

<sup>27</sup> Make a baby with Leah. We will give you Rachel also for the service which you shall serve with me yet 7 other years.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>28</sup> Jacob did so, and had sex with Leah. Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife also. 

<sup>29</sup> Laban gave Bilhah his handmaid to Rachel to be her maid.

<sup>30</sup> Jacob had sex with Rachel. He loved Rachel more than Leah. 

So he served with him yet 7 other years.

<sup>31</sup> When Enki saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.

<sup>32</sup> Leah conceived, and bare a son she named Reuben.

{{< r a="Leah" >}}
Surely Enki had looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>33</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son and said:

{{< r a="Leah" >}}
Because Enki had heard that I was hated, he had therefore given me this son also. 
{{< /r >}}

She called his name Simeon.

<sup>34</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son:

{{< r a="Leah" >}}
This time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him 3 sons
{{< /r >}}

Therefore was his name called Levi. 

<sup>35</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son. 

{{< r a="Leah" >}}
Now will I praise Enki
{{< /r >}}


Therefore she called his name Judah. 

She left bearing the stone from the well’s mouth. Then they water the sheep.
