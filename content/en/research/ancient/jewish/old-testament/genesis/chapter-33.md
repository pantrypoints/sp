<sup>1</sup> Jacob saw Esau coming with 400 men.

Jacob divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the 2 handmaids. 

<sup>2</sup> He put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 

<sup>3</sup> He passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground 7 times, until he came near to his brother. 

<sup>4</sup> Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 

<sup>5</sup> He saw the women and the children and said:

{{< r a="Esau" >}}
Who are those with you?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
The children which Enki had graciously given your servant. 6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>7</sup> Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 


<sup>8</sup> He said:

What [meanest] you by all this drove which I met?

And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord. 9} And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; 

keep that you hast unto yourself. 


{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
10 Nay, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your
face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you wast pleased with me. 

11} Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. 
{{< /l >}}


He urged him, and he took [it. ]

12 He said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you. 13} And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.


14} Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

{{< r a="Esau" >}}
15 Let me now leave with you [some] of the folk that [are] with me. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
{{< /l >}}


1} So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

17 Jacob went to Succoth and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

18 Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.

19 He bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for 100 pieces of money. 

20 He erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
