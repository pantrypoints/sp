<sup>1</sup> Dinah was the daughter of Leah and Jacob. 

She went out to see the daughters of the land. 

<sup>2</sup> Shechem was the son of Hamor the Hivite and the prince of the country. When she saw her, he took her raped her. 

<!-- , and lay with her, and
defiled her.  -->

<sup>3</sup> His soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 

<sup>4</sup> Shechem told his father Hamor:

Get me Dinah to wife.

<sup>5</sup> Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah. His sons were with his cattle in the field. Jacob held his peace until they were come.

<sup>6</sup> Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to meet Jacob.

<sup>7</sup> The sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it. The men were grieved and very angry because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which should not have been done. 

<sup>8</sup> Hamor spoke to them:

"The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her him to wife. <sup>9</sup> Make you marriages with us and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."

<sup>10</sup> You shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 

<sup>11</sup> Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren:

Let me find grace in your eyes, and what you shall say unto me I will give. 

<sup>12</sup> Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say unto me: but give me the
damsel to wife. 

<sup>13</sup> The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor deceitfully because he had defiled Dinah their sister:

<sup>14</sup> We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.

<sup>15</sup> But in this will we consent unto you: If you will be as we [be,] that every male of you be circumcised; 

<sup>16</sup> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

<sup>17</sup> But if you will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 

<sup>18</sup> Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem. 

<sup>19</sup> The young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he [was] more honourable than all the house of his father. 

<sup>20</sup> Hamor and Shechem came to the gate of their city and told the men of their city:

{{< r a="Hamor" >}}
<sup>21</sup> These men are peaceable with us. Let let them dwell in the land and trade therein. The land is  large enough for them. Let us take their daughters for wives, and give them our daughters.  22 They consent to live with us, to be one people, if every male among us is circumcised as they are.

23 [Shall] not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.

24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

25 On the third day, when they were sore, Simeon and Levi, 2 of Jacob's sons and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males with their swords.

26 They killed Hamor and Shechem and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house.

27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.

28 They took:
- their sheep, oxen, asses, and whatever was in the city and in the field
- 29 all their wealth, little ones, and wives and spoiled even all that was in the house.

30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 

We are few in number. They shall gather together against me, and kill me and my house. 

31 They said: Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
