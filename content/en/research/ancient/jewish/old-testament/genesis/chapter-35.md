1 Enki said to Jacob:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Go to Bethel. Live there and make there an altar for Enki. I appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother. 
{{< /l >}}


2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him:

Put away the strange Enkis that [are] among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 

3 Let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto Enki, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 

4 They gave unto Jacob all the strange Enkis which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.

5 They journeyed. The terror of Enki was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

6 So Jacob came to Luz, which [is] in the land of Canaan, that [is,] Bethel, he and all the people that [were] with him.

7 He built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there Enki appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 

8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.

9 Enki appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
10 Your name is no longer Jacob, but Israel. 

11 I am the Lord Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins; 12 The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.

13 Enki went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 14 Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
Enki, even a pillar of stone. He poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 

15 Jacob called the name of the place where Enki spake with him, Bethel.

16 They went from Bethel; there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed,
and she had hard labour.

17 When she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; you shalt have this son also. 18} And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin. 

19 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem. 20} And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.

21 Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 22} And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard [it.] 

Jacob has 12 sons:

23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
Issachar, and Zebulun: 

24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 

25} The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 

26} The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: 

These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Padan-aram.

27 Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 

28 Isaac lived for 180 years.

29 Isaac died and was gathered unto his people, [being] old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
