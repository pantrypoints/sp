<sup>1</sup> When all the kings of the Amorites on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea, heard that Enki had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the Israelites, until we were passed over, their heart melted.

Their spirit left because of the Israelites.

<sup>2</sup> At that time Enki said to Joshua:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Make sharp knives and circumcise again the Israelites the second time. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>3</sup> Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the Israelites at the hill of the foreskins. 

<sup>4</sup> Joshua circumcised because all the males that came out of Egypt, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way.

<sup>5</sup> They were all circumcised. But all the people that were born in the wilderness had not been circumcised. 

<sup>6</sup> The Israelites walked 40 years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of Enki: unto whom Enki sware that he would not shew them the land, which Enki sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 

<sup>7</sup> Joshua circumcised their children as they were uncircumcised during the journey. 

<sup>8</sup> After they had done circumcising all the people, they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
[to Joshua] This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>10</sup> The Israelites encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

<sup>11</sup> They ate the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched [corn] in the selfsame day.

<sup>12</sup> The manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the Israelites manna any more.

But they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

<sup>13</sup> When Joshua was by Jericho, he saw a man with sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and asked:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Are you friend or foe?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
14 I am captain of the host of Enki. 
{{< /l >}}

Joshua fell on his face and worshipped him and said:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
What did Enki tell you? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki-Agent" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Loosen your shoe from off your foot. For the place where you stand on is holy.
{{< /l >}}


Joshua did so.
