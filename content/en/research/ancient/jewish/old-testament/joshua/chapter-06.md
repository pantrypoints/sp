<sup>1</sup> Jericho was straitly shut up because of the Israelites: none went out, and none came in. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> [To Joshua:] See, I have given into your hand Jericho, its king and its mighty men of valour.

<sup>3</sup> Your army shall go around the city once for 6 days. 

<sup>4</sup> Seven priests shall bring before the army, the ark, and 7 trumpets of ram's horns. 

On the seventh day you shall go around the city 7 times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 5 When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and  when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. The wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>6</sup> So Joshua called the priests:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Take up the ark of the covenant, and let 7 priests bear 7 trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Enki. 

<sup>7</sup> Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of Enki.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>8</sup> The 7 priests bearing the 7 trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before Enki, and blew with the trumpets.

The ark of the covenant of Enki followed them.

<sup>9</sup> The armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets.

The rear guard came after the ark. All this time, the priests go on blowing with the trumpets.

<sup>10</sup> Joshua had commanded the people:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Do not shout nor make any noise with your voice. Do not say any word until the day I tell you to shout.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>11</sup> So the ark compassed the city, going around it once.

They came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 

<sup>12</sup> Joshua rose early in the morning. The priests took up the ark of Enki.

<sup>13</sup> Seven priests bearing 7 trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark went on continually, and blew with the
trumpets.

The armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of Enki, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 

<sup>14</sup> The second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did 6 days.

<sup>15</sup> On the 7th day, they:
- rose early around the dawning of the day
- compassed the city after the same manner 7 times

Only on that day they compassed the city 7 times. 

<sup>16</sup> At the 7th time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Enki hath given you the city.

<sup>17</sup> The city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to Enki: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. 

<sup>18</sup> And ye, in any wise keep [yourselves] from the accursed thing, lest you make [yourselves] accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

<sup>19</sup> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto Enki: they shall come into the
treasury of Enki.

<sup>20</sup> So the people shouted when [the priests] blew with the trumpets.

When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. 

<sup>21</sup> They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

<sup>22</sup> But Joshua had said to the 2 young men that had spied out the country:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Go into the harlot’s house and bring her out and all that she has as you sware unto her.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>23</sup> The young spies went in, and brought Rahab, her father, mother, brethren, and all that she had.

They brought out all her kindred, and left them outside the camp of Israel.

<sup>24</sup> They burnt the city and all that was in it. 

Only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Enki.*

{{< n n="This was because the Anunnaki created humans to mine metals for them" >}}

<sup>25</sup> Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had.

She lived in Israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 

<sup>26</sup> Joshua adjured them at that time, saying:

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
Cursed be the man before Enki, that rises up and rebuilds this city Jericho.

He shall:
- lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn
- set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>27</sup> So Enki was with Joshua. His fame spread throughout the land.
