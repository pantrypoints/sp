<sup>1</sup> But the Israelites committed a trespass in the accursed thing.

Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing.

This made Enki angry.

<sup>2</sup> Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country.

The men went up and viewed Ai.

<sup>3</sup> They returned to Joshua, and said:

{{< r a="Army" >}}
We need only around 3,000 men go up against Ai because they are just a few.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>4</sup> So they went up with around 3,000 men, but fled before the men of Ai. 

<sup>5</sup> The men of Ai killed 36 of them.

They chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.

<sup>6</sup> Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Enki until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust on their heads.

{{< r a="Joshua" >}}
<sup>7</sup> Alas, O Enki, why have you let these people cross the Jordan river, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us?

We would have been content to live on the other side of the river Jordan! 

<sup>8</sup> O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel retreats from their enemies?

<sup>9</sup> The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do to your great name? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>10</sup> Get up. Why do you lie on your face? 

<sup>11</sup> Israel had sinned. They have also transgressed my covenant. 

They have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff. 

<sup>12</sup> And so the Israelites could not stand before their enemies. Instead, they turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed. 

Neither will I be with you any more, until you destroy the accursed from among you. 

<sup>13</sup> Rise up. Sanctify the people, and say: 'Enki God of Israel says: Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow. There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel. You cannot stand before thine enemies, until you take away the accursed thing from among you. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>14</sup> In the morning you shall be brought according to your tribes.

The tribe which Enki chooses shall come according to its families.

The family which Enki chooses shall come forward by person.

<sup>15</sup> Whoever is caught with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has.

This is because he has:
- transgressed my covenant
- wrought folly in Israel

<sup>16</sup> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes.

The tribe of Judah was called.

<sup>17</sup> From it, the family of the Zarhites was called. 

From this family, Zabdi was called. 

<sup>18</sup> He brought the members of his household one by one.

Achan was called.
- He was the son of Carmi who was the son of Zabdi

<!-- , the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. -->

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
<sup>19</sup> [To Achan] My son, I pray that you:
- give glory to Enki God of Israel
- confess to him
- tell me what you have done
  - Do not hide it not from me. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Achan" >}}
<sup>20</sup> Yes I have sinned against Enki. <sup>21</sup> I saw among the spoils:
- a goodly Babylonish garment
- 200 shekels of silver
- a wedge of gold* of 50 shekels weight

I coveted them so I took them.
{{< /r >}}


{{< n n="This is probably symoblism for Enlil which always angers Enki" >}}


They are buried in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.

<sup>22</sup> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent.

Behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver under it.

<sup>23</sup> They took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and to all the Israelites, and laid them out before Enki.

<sup>24</sup> Joshua, and all Israel with him, took:
- Achan
- the silver
- the garment
- the wedge of gold
- his sons and daughters
- his oxen, asses, and his sheep
- his tent, and all that he had. 

They brought them unto the valley of Achor.


<sup>25</sup> Joshua said:

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
Why have you troubled us? Enki shall trouble you this day.
{{< /l >}}

All Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire aftewards. 

<sup>26</sup> They raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So Enki turned from the fierceness of his anger. 

Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
