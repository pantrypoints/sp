<sup>1</sup> Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how:
- Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho
- Gibeonites had made peace with Israel, and were among them 


<sup>2</sup> They feared greatly, because:
- Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities
- it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty. 

<sup>3</sup> So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent a message to:
- Hoham king of Hebron
- Piram king of Jarmuth
- Japhia king of Lachish
- Debir king of Eglon

{{< r a="Adoni-zedek" >}}
<sup>4</sup> Help me smite Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites. 
{{< /r >}}


<sup>5</sup> So the 5 kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered and went with all their hosts and encamped before Gibeon and made war against it.

<sup>6</sup> The men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying:

{{< r a="Gibeonites" >}}
Come up to us quickly and save us. All the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. 
{{< /r >}}

<sup>7</sup> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal with his entire army.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>8</sup> Do not fear them. I have delivered them into your hand. There shall not a man of them stand before you. 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>9</sup> So Joshua came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night. 

<sup>10</sup> Enki discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 

<sup>11</sup> As they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that Enki cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died.

They were more which died with hailstones than they whom the Israelites slew with the sword.

<sup>12</sup> Then spake Joshua to Enki in the day when Enki delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel:

<!-- and he said in the sight of Israel,  -->

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
Sun, stand still on Gibeon. Moon, stand still in the valley of Ajalon.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>13</sup> The sun and moon stood still until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies.

 [Is] not this written in the book of Jasher? 

So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

<sup>14</sup> There was no day like that before it or after it, that Enki hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Enki fought for Israel.

<sup>15</sup> Joshua returned with his entire army unto the camp to Gilgal. 

<sup>16</sup> But these 5 kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. 

{{< r a="Messenger" >}}
<sup>17</sup> The 5 kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
<sup>18</sup> Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them.

<sup>19</sup> Stay you not, [but] pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Enki hath delivered them into your hand. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>20</sup> After Joshua and the Israelites finished the killing, the survivors retreated into fortified cities.

<sup>21</sup> The armyu returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the Israelites. 

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
<sup>22</sup> Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out the 5 kings to me.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>23-24</sup> They did so. Joshua then called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him:

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. 

<sup>25</sup> Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Enki do to all your enemies against whom you fight.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>26</sup> Afterwards, Joshua slew them and hanged them on 5 trees until the evening. 

<sup>27</sup> At sunset, Joshua commanded them to be brought down from the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, [which remain] until this very day.

<sup>28</sup> On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it. 

He utterly destroyed its king and all the souls in it. 

<!-- [that were] therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. -->


29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 30} And Enki delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were]
therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
'
31 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 

32 Enki delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.

33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

34} And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 35} And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

36 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: 37} And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that [were] therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that [were] therein.

<sup>38</sup> Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: 

<sup>39</sup> He took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that [were] therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.

<sup>40</sup> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Enki God of Israel commanded.

<sup>41</sup> Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 

<sup>42</sup> All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Enki God of Israel fought for Israel. 

<sup>43</sup> Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
