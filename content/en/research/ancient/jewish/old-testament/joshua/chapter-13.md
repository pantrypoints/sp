I will drive them out before the Israelites. Only divide you it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. 

7 Now divide this land for an inheritance unto the 9 tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 8} With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses gave them.

9} From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 10} And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

11 Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 12} All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

13 Nevertheless the Israelites expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day. 

14 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of Enki God of Israel made by fire [are] their inheritance

15 Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben [inheritance] according to their families. 

16 Their coast was from Aroer, that [is] on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] in the midst of the river and all the plain by Medeba; 

17 Heshbon, and all her cities that [are] in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth- baal, and Beth-baal-meon, 18} And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 19 and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley, 20} And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth, 21} And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, [which were] dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.

22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the Israelites slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

23 The border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

24 Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families.

25 Their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah; 26} From Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

27 And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and [his] border, [even] unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 

28 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.


29 Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and [this] was [the possession] of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. 

30 Their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities: 

31 half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, [were pertaining] unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families. 

32 These [are the countries] which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

<sup>33</sup> But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not [any] inheritance: Enki God of Israel [was] their inheritance, as he said unto them.
