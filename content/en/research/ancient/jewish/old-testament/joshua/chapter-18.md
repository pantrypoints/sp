<sup>1</sup>  The whole congregation of Israelites assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. 

The land was subdued before them. 

2 There remained among the Israelites 7 tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.

3 Joshua said to the Israelites:

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
How long are you slack to go to possess the land, which Enki God of your fathers hath given you?

4 Give out from among you 3 men for each tribe. I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.

5 They shall divide it into 7 parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. 

6 You shall therefore describe the land into 7 parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before Enki our God.

7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of Enki is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of Enki gave them.

8 The men arose and went away. Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying:

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
Go and walk through the land, and survey it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before Enki in Shiloh.
{{< /l >}}


9 The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into 7 parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.

<sup>10</sup> Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Enki: and there Joshua divided the land unto the Israelites according to their divisions.

<sup>11</sup> The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.


## The Results of the Survey

<sup>12</sup> Their border on the north side was from Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 

13 The border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; The border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that [lieth] on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.

14 The border was drawn [thence,] and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that [lieth] before Beth- horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which [is] Kirjath- jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this [was] the west quarter.

15 The south quarter [was] from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah

16 The border came down to the end of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley of the son of Hinnom, [and] which [is] in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel, {18:17} And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which [is] over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, {18:18} And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:

19 The border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this [was] the south coast. {18:20} And Jordan was the border of it on the
east side. 

This [was] the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families. {18:21} Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz, {18:22} And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, {18:23} And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, {18:24} And Chephar- haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: {18:25} Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, {18:26} And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, {18:27} And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, {18:28} And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem, Gibeath, [and] Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages.
