1 Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

2 He called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them:

{{< l a="Joshua" >}}
I am old and stricken in age. 3 You have seen all that Enki has done unto all these nations because of you; for Enki your God is he that has fought for you. 4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.

5 Enki shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as Enki your God hath promised unto you. 

6 Be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses. Do not turn aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left.

7 Do not come among these nations that remain among you; neither make mention of the names of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them,] neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 

8 But cleave unto Enki, as you have done unto this day.

9 For Enki hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but [as for] you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.

10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Enki, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that you love Enki. 12} Else if you do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, [even] these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 

13 Know for a certainty that Enki will no more drive out [any of] these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Enki hath given you.

14 This day I [am] going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Enki spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, [and] not one thing hath failed thereof.

15 Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good things are come upon you, which the Enki promised you; so shall Enki bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Enki hath given you. 

16 When you have transgressed the covenant of Enki, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of Enki be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
