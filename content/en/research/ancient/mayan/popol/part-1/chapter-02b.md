The Creator and the Maker said: 

{{< l a="Creator and Maker" >}}
Let us try again because our creatures will not be able to walk nor multiply.
{{< /l >}}


Then they broke up and destroyed their work and their creation.

{{< l a="Creator and Maker" >}}
What shall we do to perfect it, in order that our worshipers, our invokers, will be successful?
{{< /l >}}

Thus they spoke when they conferred again: 

{{< l a="Creator and Maker" >}}
Let us say again to Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, Hunahpú-Vuch, Hunahpú-Utiú: 'Cast your lot again. Try to create again.'
{{< /l >}}


<!-- In this way the Creator and the Maker spoke to Xpiyacoc and Xmucané. -->

Thus they spoke to the soothsayers:
- Xpiyacoc, the Grandmother of the day
- Xmucané, the Grandmother of the Dawn

<!-- , as they were called by the Creator and the Maker, and whose names were  and *. -->

{{< n n="These are the technicians" >}}



{{< r a="Huracán, Tepeu, and Gucumatz" >}}
[to the soothsayer, the Maker:] You must work together and find the means so that man, whom we shall make will nourish and sustain us, invoke and remember us. Enter, then, into council, grandmother, grandfather, our grandmother, our grandfather, Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, make light, make dawn, have us invoked, have us adored, have us remembered by created man, by made man, by mortal man. Thus be it done.

Let your nature be known, Hunahpú-Vuch, Hunahpú-Utiú, twice mother, twice father, Nim-Ac, Nima-Tziís, the master of emeralds, the worker in jewels, the sculptor, the carver, the maker of beautiful plates, the maker of green gourds, the master of resin, the master Toltecat,* grandmother of the sun, grandmother of dawn, as you will be called by our works and our creatures.

{{< f f="*Here the text seems to enumerate the usual occupations of the men of that time. The author calls upon ahqual, who is evidently the one who carves emeralds or green stones; ahyamanic, the jeweler or silversmith; ahchut, engraver or sculptor; ahtzalam, carver or cabinetmaker; ahraxalac, he who fashions green or beautiful plates; ahraxazel, he who makes the beautiful green vases or gourds (called Xicalli in Náhuatl,)--the word raxá has both meanings; ahgol, he who makes the resin or copal; and, finally, ahtoltecat, he who, without doubt, was the silversmith. The Tolteca were in fact, skilled silversmiths who, according to the legend, were taught the art by Quetzalcoatl himself." >}}



{{< r a="Huracán, Tepeu, and Gucumatz" >}}
Cast the lot with your grains of corn and the tzité.** Do it thus, and we shall know if we are to make, or carve his mouth and eyes out of wood.
{{< /r >}}


Thus the diviners were told.

{{< f f="*Erythrina corallodendron. Tzité, arbol de pito in Guatemala; Tzompanquahuitl in the Mexican language. It is used in both countries to make fences. Its fruit is a pod which contains red grains resembling a bean which the Indians used, as they still do, together with grains of corn, in their fortunetelling and witchcraft. In his Informe contra Idolorum Cultores, Sánchez de Aguilar says that the Maya Indians 'cast lots with a large handful of corn.' As is seen, the practice which is still observed by the Maya-Quiché is of respectable antiquity." >}}



They went down at once to make their divination, and cast their lots with the corn and the tzité. 

{{< r a="Xpiyacoc and Xmucane" >}}
Fate! Creature!
{{< /r >}}

- Xpiyacoc was an old man who cast the lots with Tzite. 
- Chiracán Xmucane was an old woman who was the diviner, the maker.


Beginning the divination, they said: 

{{< r a="Xpiyacoc and Xmucane" >}}
Get together, grasp each other! Speak, that we may hear.

Say if it is well that the wood be got together and that it be carved by the Creator and the Maker, and if this [man of wood] is he who must nourish and sustain us when there is light when it is day!

[To the corn, tzité, fate, the creature:] You corn, tzité, fate, creature! Get together, take each other. Come to sacrifice here, Heart of Heaven; do not disappoint Tepeu and Gucumatz!" 

Your figures of wood shall come out well; they shall speak and talk on earth.
{{< /r  >}}

<!-- punish -->

<!-- Then they talked and spoke the truth:  -->

<!-- "So may it be," they answered when they spoke. -->

Instantly, the figures were made of wood. They looked like men, talked like men, and populated the surface of the earth.

They existed and multiplied.

They had daughters, they had sons, these wooden figures.

But they did not have souls, nor minds, they did not remember their Creator, their Maker. They walked on all fours, aimlessly*.

They no longer remembered the Heart of Heaven and therefore they fell out of favor.


It was merely a trial, an attempt at man. At first they spoke, but their face was without expression. Their feet and hands had no strength. They had no blood, nor substance, nor moisture, nor flesh. 

Their cheeks were dry, their feet and hands were dry, and their flesh was yellow.

Therefore, they no longer thought of their Creator nor their Maker, nor of those who made them and cared for them.

These were the first men who existed in great numbers on the face of the earth.
