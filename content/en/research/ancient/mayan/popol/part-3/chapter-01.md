## Chapter 1

Here, then, is the beginning of when it was decided to make man, and when what must enter into the flesh of man was sought.

<!-- The Forefathers, the Creators and Makers, who were called -->

The Creators Tepeu and Gucumatz said: 

{{< l a="Tepeu-Gucumatz">}}
The time of dawn has come, let the work be finished, and let those who are to nourish and sustain us appear, the noble sons, the civilized vassals; let man appear, humanity, on the face of the earth."
{{< /l >}}


They held council in the night. Then they sought, discussed, reflected, and thought. In this way, they decided on what must enter into the flesh of man.

<!-- It was just before the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared over the Creators and Makers. -->


The yellow ears of corn and the white ears of corn came from Paxil, from Cayalá.

These are the names of the animals which brought the food:
- yac (the mountain cat)
- utiú (the coyote)
- quel (a small parrot)
- hoh (the crow)

These 4 animals gave tidings of the yellow ears and white ears of corn. They told them that they should go to Paxil and they showed them the road to Paxil.

Thus they found the food. This food went into the flesh of the created man.

This was his blood.

<!-- ; of this the blood of man was made.  -->

So the corn entered [into the formation of man] by the work of the Forefathers.

They were filled with joy because they had found a beautiful land, full of pleasures, abundant in ears of yellow corn and ears of white corn, and abundant also in pataxte and cacao, and in innumerable zapotes, anonas, jocotes, nantzes, matasanos, and honey.

There was an abundance of delicious food in those villages called Paxil and Cayalá. 

There were foods of every kind, small and large foods, small plants and large plants.

The animals showed them the road. 

Xmucané made 9 drinks by grinding the yellow and white corn. From this food came the strength and the flesh, and with it they created the muscles and the strength of man. 

<!-- This the Forefathers did, Tepeu and Gucumatz, as they were called. -->

After that, they began to talk about the creation and the making of our first mother and father.
- Their flesh was made of yellow corn and white corn.
- Their arms and legs were made of corn meal dough. 

Only dough of corn meal went into the flesh of our first fathers, the 4 men, who were created.
