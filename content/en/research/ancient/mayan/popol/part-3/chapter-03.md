Then their wives had being, and their women were made. 

God himself made them carefully. 

And so, during sleep, they came, truly beautiful, their women, at the side of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.

There were their women when they awakened, and instantly their hearts were filled with joy because of their wives.

- Cahá-Paluna was the wife of Balam-Quitzé
- Chomihá was the wife of Balam-Acab
- Tzununihá was the wife of Mahucutah
- Caquixahá was the wife of Iqui-Balam

<!-- These are the names of their wives, who were distinguished women. -->

They conceived the men, of the small tribes and of the large tribes, and were the origin of us; the people of Quiché.

There were many priests and sacrificers. There were not only four, but those four were the Forefathers of us, the people of the Quiché.

The names of each one were different when they multiplied there in the East. There were many names of the people: Tepeu, Olomán, Cohah, Quenech, Ahau, as they called those men there in the East, where they multiplied.

The beginning is known, too, of those of Tamub and those of Ilocab who came together from there in the East.

Balam-Quitzé was the grandfather and the father of the nine great houses of the Cavec.

Balam-Acab was the grandfather and father of the nine great houses of the Nimhaib

Mahucutah, the grandfather and father of the four great houses of Ahau-Quiché.

Three groups of families existed. But they did not forget the name of their grandfather and father, those who propagated and multiplied there in the East.

The following came:
- the Tamub and Ilocab
- 13 branches of peoples
- 13 of Tecpán, and those of Rabinal, the Cakchiquel, those from Tziquinahá, and the Zacahá and the Lamaq, Cumatz, Tuhalhá, Uchabahá, those of Chumilahá, those of Quibahá, of Batenabá, Acul-Vinac, Balamihá, the Canchahel, and Balam-Colob.

These are only the principal tribes, the branches of the people which we mention. Only of the principal ones shall we speak. 

Many others came from each group of the people, but we shall not write their names. They also multiplied there in the East.

Many men were made and in the darkness they multiplied. 

Neither the sun nor the light had yet been made when they multiplied. 

All lived together, they existed in great number and walked there in the East.

Nevertheless, they did not sustain nor maintain [their God]. 

They only raised their faces to the sky, and they did not know why they had come so far as they did.

There they were then, in great number, the black men and the white men, men of many classes, men of many tongues, that it was wonderful to hear them.

There are generations in the world, there are country people, whose faces we do not see, who have no homes, they only wander through the small and large woodlands, like crazy people. 

So it is said scornfully of the people of the wood. So they said there, where they saw the rising of the sun.

The speech of all was the same. They did not invoke wood nor stone. They remembered the word of the Creator and the Maker, the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of Earth.

In this manner they spoke, while they thought about the coming of the dawn.

They raised their prayers:

<!-- , those worshipers of the word [of God], loving, obedient, and fearful, raising their faces to the sky when they asked for daughters and sons. -->


{{< q a="People" >}}
Oh Tzacol, Bitol! Look at us, hear us! 

Do not leave us, do not forsake us, oh, God, who in heaven and on earth, Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth!

Give us our descendants, our succession, as long as the sun shall move and there shall be light. 

Let it dawn; let the day come! Give us many good roads, flat roads! May the people have peace, much peace, and may they be happy. 

Give us good life and useful existence! Oh, thou Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, Raxa-Caculhá, Chipi-Nanauac, Raxa-Nanauac, Voc, Hunahpú, Tepeu, Gucumatz, Alom, Qaholom, Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, grandmother of the sun, grandmother of the light. 

Let there be dawn, and let the light come!"

They prayed this while the sun rose.

 <!-- saw and invoked the coming of the sun, the arrival of day -->

At the same time, they contemplated the Morning Star which comes ahead of the sun.*

{{< n n="The Morning Star is likely the Anunnaki ship which is orbiting at L1 (Lagrange point) position" >}}


 <!-- that lights up the arch of the sky and the surface of the earth, and illuminates the steps of the men who had been created and made. -->
