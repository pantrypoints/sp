Like heaven itself, your just matrix, in which gods too can be born, is beyond reach. 

Giving birth to kings who put on the good diadem, giving birth to lords who wear the crown on their heads -- your lord, the honoured lord, sits with An the king on An's dais.

Your king, the Great Mountain, Father Enlil, the father of all the lands, has blocked you impenetrably (?) like a cedar tree. The Anuna, the great gods, have taken up dwellings in your midst, and consume their food in your giguna shrines among the unique and exceptional trees. 

Household Sumer, may your:
- sheepfolds be built
- cattle multiply
- giguna touch the skies
- good temples reach up to heaven.

May the Anuna determine the destinies in your midst."

The Great Mountain Enlil has pronounced your name great in heaven and on earth. 

City whose fate Enki has decreed, sanctuary of Urim, you shall rise high to heaven!"

221-237. "Black land, may your trees be great trees, may your forests be forests of highland meš trees! 

Chairs made from them will grace royal palaces! May your reeds be great reeds, may they ……! 

Heroes shall …… them on the battlefield as weapons! 

May your bulls be great bulls, may they be bulls of the mountains! May their bellowing be the bellowing of wild bulls of the mountains! 

The great powers of the gods shall be made perfect for you! May the francolins of the mountains wear cornelian beards! 

May your birds all be peacocks! May their cries grace royal palaces! 

May all your silver be gold! May all your copper be tin-bronze! Land, may all you possess be plentiful! 

May your people ……! May your men go forth like bulls against their fellow men!"
