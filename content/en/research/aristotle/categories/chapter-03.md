{{< n n="We present here the Superhysics translation of Aristotle, which might not be consistent with a shallow interpretation">}}

When one thing is metaphysically subordinate to another thing thing, just as object is the predicate of a subject, then the qualities of that thing will be present in the other thing also. 

For example, the idea of man in general is metaphysically subordinate to individual man as an idea, and animal as an idea is suboridate to man as an idea. Therefore, animal will be metaphysically subordinate to the individual man, for the individual man is both a man and an animal, metaphysically. 

The diversity of classes of ideas that are not under one another are different in essence. For example, the class of animal, as idea, is different from the idea of knowledge.

The idea of animal has subordinate diverse essence-ideas as terrestrial, two-footed, winged, aquatic. But none of these ideas is the essence of knowledge.
For one knowledge does not differ from another knowledge by being two-footed. 

On the other hand, the same essences belong to the classes that under one another. For the higher classes are superior to the lower ones, so that as many diverse essences that belong to the subordinate classes will also belong to their superior class.



<!-- Whenever one thing is a predicate of a subject, everything that is said of that thing will also be said of its subject.

{{< n n="This is relationality" >}}

For example:
- man is predicated of the individual [specific] man
- animal [in general] is predicated of that individual man

Therefore, animal [in general] will be predicated of the individual [specific] man.

{{< n n="This is the connection of ideas or objects via relationality" >}} -->

<!-- —for the individual man is both a man and an animal.  -->

<!-- 2. Difference of distinct genera induces difference in species under them.The differences of different genera, and of things not arranged under each other, are diverse also in species,[7] as of "animal" and "science." For the differences of "animal" are "quadruped," "biped," "winged," "aquatic," but none of these, forms the difference of "science," since "science," 

3. Not so as to subaltern genera.does not differ from "science," in being "biped." But as to subaltern genera, there is nothing to prevent the differences being the same, as the superior are predicated of the genera under them; so that as many differences as there are of the predicate, so many will there also be of the subject. -->



<!-- **The differentiae of genera that are not under one another are different in kind.** 

For example, the differentiae of animal and of knowledge are different in kind.

An animal's differentiae [qualities] are:
- terrestrial
- two-footed
- winged
- aquatic, etc

But none of these is a differentia [quality] of knowledge.

For knowledge does not differ from knowledge by being two-footed. 

On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent the same differentiae [quality] from belonging to genera that are under one another.

For the lower genera [classes] are predicates of higher genera. So that as many differentiae [qualities] as belong to the predicated [subordinate] genus will also belong to the subject [superior] genus.
