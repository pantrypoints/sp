1. Incomplex universals

Of things incomplex enunciated, each signifies either Substance, or Quantity, or Quality, or Relation, or Where, or When, or Position, or Possession, or Action, or Passion.

But Substance is generally as "man," "horse;" 

Quantity, as "two" or "three cubits;" 

Quality, as "white," a "grammatical thing;" 

Relation, as "a double," "a half," "greater;"

Where, as "in the Forum," "in the Lyceum;" When, as "yesterday," "last year;" Position, as "he reclines," "he sits;" Possession, as "he is shod," "he is armed;" 

Action, as "he cuts," "he burns;" 

Passion, as "he is cut," "he is burnt." 


2. Categories by themselves, neither affirmative nor negative.Now each of the above, considered by itself, is predicated neither affirmatively nor negatively, but from the connexion of these with each other, affirmation or negation arises. 

For every affirmation or negation appears to be either true or false, but of things enunciated without any connexion, none is either true or false, as "man," "white," "runs," "conquers."
