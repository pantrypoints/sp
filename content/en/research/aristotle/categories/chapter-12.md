A thing is said to be prior to another in four respects:

1. When it is older of have had longer time

<!-- In respect of time -->

This makes one older and more ancient than another.

The older and more ancient has a longer time.

2. When there is no reciprocity as to the consequence of existence.when it does not reciprocate, according to the consequence of existence: thus one is prior to two, for two existing, it follows directly that one exists; 

But when one is, it is not necessary that two should be, hence the consequence of the remainder's existence does not reciprocate from the existence of the one; but such a thing appears to be prior, from which the consequence of existence does not reciprocate.

3. In respect of order.Thirdly, the prior is that predicated according to a certain order, as in the instance of sciences and discourses, for in demonstrative sciences, the prior and the posterior, subsist in order, since the elements are prior in order, to the diagrams, and in grammar, letters are before syllables; so also of discourses, as the proem is prior, in order, to the narration.

4. In excellence.

The better and more excellent appear to be prior by nature. The common people are accustomed to say, that those whom they chiefly honour and especially regard, are prior in their esteem;[66] In the text, but this is nearly the most foreign of all the modes, wherefore such are (nearly) the modes of priority which have been enumerated.

2. Another mode of priority may be added, where one thing is the cause of another's existing.Besides the above-mentioned, there may yet appear to be another mode of the prior; as of things reciprocating, according to the consequence of existence, that which in any respect is the cause of the existence of the one, may justly be said to be by nature prior, and that there are, certain things of this kind, is manifest. For that man exists, reciprocates, according to the consequence of existence, with the true sentence respecting him, since if man is, the sentence is true, by which we say, that man is, and it reciprocates, since if the sentence be true, by which we say that man is, then man is. Notwithstanding, a true sentence, is by no means the cause of a thing's existence, but in some way, the thing appears the cause of the sentence being true, for in consequence of a thing existing, or not existing, is a sentence said to be true or false. Wherefore one thing may be called prior to another, according to five modes.[67]
