1. Having predicated in many ways.

1. Quality.To have, is predicated in many modes;[73] either as habit and disposition or some other quality, for we are said to have knowledge and virtue; 

2. Quantity.
or as to quantity, as the size which any one has; thus he is said to have the size of three or four cubits; 3. Investiture.

4. In a part.

5. As to a part.

6. In measure.or as things about the body, as a garment or a tunic;[74] or as in a part, as a ring in the hand; or as a part, as the hand or the foot; or as in a vessel, as a bushel has wheat, or a flagon, wine, for the flagon is said to have[75] the wine, and the bushel the wheat; all these therefore are said to have, as in a vessel; 7. Possession.or as a possession, for we are said to have a house or land.
A man is also said to have a wife, and the wife a husband, but the mode now mentioned, of "to have," seems the most foreign, 8. Also indirectly or by analogy.for we mean nothing else by having a wife, than that she cohabits with a man; there may perhaps appear to be some other modes of having, but those usually mentioned have nearly all been enumerated.
