What is Happiness?

<!-- Our basis for the answer should be from:
- our conclusion
- the data from our reasoning
- the data from what is commonly said about it

This is because with what is true all things which really are are in harmony, but with that which is false the true very soon jars. -->

Goods are commonly divided into 3 classes:

1. The External
2. Those of the soul and body
3. Those belonging to the soul we call most properly and specially good

My definition assumes that the actions and workings of the soul constitute Happiness.
- These belong to the soul. 

And so our account is a good one, at least according to this opinion, which is of ancient date, and accepted by those who profess philosophy. 

Rightly too are certain actions and workings said to be the end, for thus it is brought into the number of the goods of the soul instead of the external. 

Agreeing also with our definition is the common notion, that the happy man lives well and does well, for it has been stated by us to be pretty much a kind of living well and doing well.

The points required in Happiness are found in combination in our account of it.

For some think it is virtue, others practical wisdom, others a kind of scientific philosophy; others that it is these, or else some one of them, in combination with pleasure, or at least not independently of it; while others again take in external prosperity.

Of these opinions, some rest on the authority of numbers or antiquity, others on that of few, and those men of note: and it is not likely that either of these classes should be wrong in all points, but be right at least in some one, or even in most.

I agree with those who assert it to be Virtue (Excellence), or some kind of Virtue.
- This is because working in the way of Excellence surely belongs to Excellence.

There is no unimportant difference between conceiving of the Chief Good as in possession or as in use, in other words, as a mere state or as a working. 

For the state or habit may possibly exist in a subject without effecting any good, as, for instance, in him who is asleep, or in any other way inactive; but the working cannot so, for it will of necessity act, and act well.

At the Olympic games it is not the finest and strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter the lists.
- For out of these, the prize-men are selected.

So too in life, of the honourable and the good, it is they who act who rightly win the prizes.[24]

Their life too is in itself pleasant.

Pleasure is a mental sensation. We get pleasure from what we are fond of:
- A horse is a pleasure for him who is fond of horses
- Sight is a pleasure for him who is fond of sights
- The just is a pleasure to him who is fond of justice.
- The things in accordance with virtue is pleasure to him who is fond of virtue. 

Now in the case of the multitude of men the things which they individually esteem pleasant clash, because they are not such by nature, whereas to the lovers of nobleness those things are pleasant which are such by nature: 

but the actions in accordance with virtue are of this kind, so that they are pleasant both to the individuals and also in themselves.

So then their life has no need of pleasure as a kind of additional appendage, but involves pleasure in itself. 

For, besides what I have just mentioned, a man is not a good man at all who feels no pleasure in noble actions,[25] just as no one would call that man just who does not feel pleasure in acting justly, or liberal who does not in liberal actions, and similarly in the case of the other virtues which might be enumerated: and if this be so, then the actions in accordance with virtue must be in themselves pleasurable. 

Then again they are certainly good and noble, and each of these in the highest degree; if we are to take as right the judgment of the good man, for he judges as we have said.

Thus then Happiness is most excellent, most noble, and most pleasant, and these attributes are not separated as in the well-known Delian inscription:

{{< l a="Delian Inscription" >}}
Most noble is that which is most just, but best is health;
And naturally most pleasant is the obtaining one’s desires.
{{< /l >}}


For all these co-exist in the best acts of working: and we say that Happiness is these, or one, that is, the best of them.

It still requires the addition of external goods. Without appliances it is impossible, or at all events not easy to do noble actions.

Friends, money, and political influence are instruments whereby many things are done.

Some things there are again a deficiency in which mars blessedness; good birth, for instance, or fine offspring, or even personal beauty: for he is not at all capable of Happiness who is very ugly, or is ill-born, or solitary and childless.

Still less perhaps supposing him to have very bad children or friends, or to have lost good ones by death. As we have said already, the addition of prosperity of this kind does seem necessary to complete the idea of Happiness; hence some rank good fortune, and others virtue, with Happiness.
