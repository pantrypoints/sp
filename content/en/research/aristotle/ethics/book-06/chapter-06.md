Knowledge is a conception concerning universals and Necessary matter.

There are First Principles in all trains of demonstrative reasoning.

Demonstrative reasoning leads to all kinds of Knowledge because Knowledge is connected with reasoning.

**The faculty which takes in the first principles, of that which comes within Knowledge, is intuition.** 

The first principles cannot be discovered by:

- Knowledge
  - This is because the object of Knowledge must be derived from demonstrative reasoning.
- Art or Practical Wisdom
  - This is because these are exercised upon Contingent matter only.
- Science which takes in these
  - This is because the Scientific Man must in some cases depend on demonstrative Reasoning.

The faculties that help us attain truth 

The faculties of Knowledge, Practical Wisdom, Science, and Intuition are never deceived when dealing with matter Necessary or even Contingent.

<!-- , and the faculty which takes in First Principles cannot be any of the three first; the last, namely Intuition, must be it which performs this function. -->
