All these mental states tend to the same object.

γνώμη [gnome or reasoned-belief], Judiciousness, Practical Wisdom, and Practical Intuition all have γνώμη and Practical Intuition to the same Individuals whom we call Practically-Wise and Judicious.

This is because all these faculties are employed upon the extremes, i.e. on particular details.

In right of his aptitude for deciding on the matters which come within the province of the Practically-Wise, a man is Judicious and possessed of good gnome; i.e. he is disposed to make allowance, for considerations of equity are entertained by all good men alike in transactions with their fellows.

All matters of Moral Action belong to the class of particulars, otherwise called extremes: for the man of Practical Wisdom must know them, and Judiciousness and γνώμη are concerned with matters of Moral Actions, which are extremes.

Intuition takes in the extremes at both ends.

The first and last terms must be taken in not by reasoning but by Intuition [so that Intuition comes to be of two kinds], and that which belongs to strict demonstrative reasonings takes in immutable, i.e. Necessary, first terms; while that which is employed in practical matters takes in the extreme, the Contingent, and the minor Premiss:[44] for the minor Premisses are the source of the Final Cause, Universals being made up out of Particulars.[45] To take in these, of course, we must have Sense, i.e. in other words Practical Intuition.

This is why these are thought to be simply gifts of nature.

Whereas no man is thought to be Scientific by nature, men are thought to have γνώμη, and Judiciousness, and Practical Intuition: a proof of which is that we think these faculties are a consequence even of particular ages, and this given age has Practical Intuition and γνώμη, we say, as if under the notion that nature is the cause. And thus Intuition is both the beginning and end, because the proofs are based upon the one kind of extremes and concern the other.

And so one should attend to the undemonstrable dicta and opinions of the skilful, the old and the Practically-Wise, no less than to those which are based on strict reasoning, because they see aright, having gained their power of moral vision from experience.
