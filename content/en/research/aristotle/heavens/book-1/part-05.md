The majority of the ancient philosophers thought that there is there an infinite body. Is this an impossibility? 

This is all-important to our search for the truth. 

This problem has been the source of the differences of those who have written about nature as a whole since the least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.

If you admit the existence of a minimum magnitude, then this minimum which you have introduced causes the greatest truths of mathematics to totter because a principle is greater in power than in extent.

Hence that which was small at the start turns out a giant at the end. 

The conception of the infinite has this power of principles.

Quantities possess it more than any other conception.

 <!-- so that it is in no way absurd or unreasonable that the assumption that an infinite body exists should be of peculiar moment to our inquiry. The infinite, then, we must now discuss, opening the whole matter from the beginning. -->

Every body is either simple or composite. The infinite body, therefore, will be either simple or composite.

But if the simple bodies are finite, the composite must also be finite, since that which composes finite bodies in number and magnitude is itself finite in respect of number and magnitude.
- Its quantity is the same as that of the bodies which compose it.

Can any of the simple bodies be infinite in magnitude or not?

  <!-- or whether this is impossible. Let us try the primary body first, and then go on to consider the others. -->

The body which moves in a circle must necessarily be finite in every respect, for the following reasons.

1. If the body so moving is infinite, the radii drawn from the centre will be infinite. 

But the space between infinite radii is infinite. 

The space between the radii is the area outside which no magnitude which is in contact with the two lines can be conceived as falling.

This will be infinite because:

- In the case of finite radii it is always finite
- In it one can always go on to a width greater than any given width

Thus, the reasoning which forces us to believe in infinite number, because there is no maximum, applies also to the space between the radii.

The infinite cannot be traversed, and if the body is infinite the interval between the radii is necessarily infinite: circular motion therefore is an impossibility.

Yet our eyes tell us that the heavens revolve in a circle.

 <!-- and by argument also we have determined that there is something to which circular movement belongs. -->

2. If from a finite time a finite time be subtracted, what remains must be finite and have a beginning. 

If the time of a journey has a beginning, there must be a beginning also of the movement, and consequently also of the distance traversed. This applies universally. 

Take a line, ACE, infinite in one direction, E, and another line, BB, infinite in both directions. 

Let ACE describe a circle, revolving upon C as centre. In its movement it will cut BB continuously for a certain time. 

This will be a finite time, since the total time is finite in which the heavens complete their circular orbit, and consequently the time subtracted from it, during which the one line in its motion cuts the other, is also finite.

Therefore, there will be a point at which ACE began for the first time to cut BB. This, however, is impossible. The infinite, then, cannot revolve in a circle; nor could the world, if it were infinite.

3. The infinite cannot move is shown as follows.

Let `A` be a finite line moving past the finite line, `B`. 

Of necessity `A` will pass clear of B and B of A at the same moment; for each overlaps the other to precisely the same extent. 

If the 2 were both moving, and moving in contrary directions, they would pass clear of one another more rapidly.

If one were still and the other moving past it, less rapidly; provided that the speed of the latter were the same in both cases. 

This, however, is clear: that it is impossible to traverse an infinite line in a finite time. 

Infinite time, then, would be required. (This we demonstrated above in the discussion of movement.) 

It makes no difference whether a finite is passing by an infinite or an infinite by a finite. 

For when A is passing B, then B overlaps A and it makes no difference whether B is moved or unmoved, except that, if both move, they pass clear of one another more quickly.

It is, however, quite possible that a moving line should in certain cases pass one which is stationary quicker than it passes one moving in an opposite direction. 

One has only to imagine the movement to be slow where both move and much faster where one is stationary. 

To suppose one line stationary, then, makes no difficulty for our argument, since it is quite possible for A to pass B at a slower rate when both are moving than when only one is.

If, therefore, the time which the finite moving line takes to pass the other is infinite, then necessarily the time occupied by the motion of the infinite past the finite is also infinite. 

For the infinite to move at all is thus absolutely impossible; since the very smallest movement conceivable must take an infinity of time.

Moreover the heavens certainly revolve, and they complete their circular orbit in a finite time; so that they pass round the whole extent of any line within their orbit, such as the finite line AB. The revolving body, therefore, cannot be infinite.

4. A line which has a limit cannot be infinite.

Or if it is infinite, it is so only in length.

So a surface cannot be infinite if it has a limit or if it is completely determinate in any respect.

Whether it be a square or a circle or a sphere, it cannot be infinite, any more than a foot-rule can.

There is then no such thing as an infinite sphere or square or circle, and where there is no circle there can be no circular movement, and similarly where there is no infinite at all there can be no infinite movement.

From this it follows that, an infinite circle being itself an impossibility, there can be no circular motion of an infinite body.

5. Take a centre C, an infinite line, AB, another infinite line at right angles to it, E, and a moving radius, CD. 

`CD` will never cease contact with E, but the position will always be something like CE, CD cutting E at F. The infinite line, therefore, refuses to complete the circle.

6. If the heaven is infinite and moves in a circle, then in a finite time, it has traversed the infinite.

For suppose the fixed heaven infinite, and that which moves within it equal to it. It results that when the infinite body has completed its revolution, it has traversed an infinite equal to itself in a finite time. But that we know to be impossible.

7. If the time of revolution is finite, the area traversed must also be finite; but the area traversed was equal to itself.

Therefore, it is itself finite.

Thus the body which moves in a circle is not endless or infinite, but has its limit.
