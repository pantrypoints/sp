What is the position and shape of the earth? Is it at rest or in motion?

1. Those who believe in a finite whole heaven say that the Earth lies at the centre.

But the Italian philosophers known as Pythagoreans take the contrary view. 

They say that at the centre is fire.*
- the earth is one of the stars, creating night and day by its circular motion about the centre.

They further construct another earth in opposition to ours which they call the counterearth. 

{{< n n="This is the correct heliocentric view. However, the fire element is in the middle of the 5 elements and is not the sun. The 5th element creates the counterearth which shows the messing up of the ideas within the Pythagoreans which actually continues with Kepler" >}}


<!-- They force their observations and try to accommodate them to certain theories and opinions of their own.  -->

But many others agree that it is wrong to give the earth the central position.

They believe that the most precious thing should be in the center. 

Fire, they say, is more precious than earth and so fire is in the center.

 <!-- and the limit than the intermediate, and the circumference and the centre are limits.  -->

<!-- Reasoning on this basis they take the view that it is not earth that lies at the centre of the sphere, but rather fire.  -->

The Pythagoreans hold that the most important part of the world is the centre.
- This center should be most strictly guarded.
- They call this the 'Guardhouse of Zeus'

They use the word 'centre' unequivocally:
- The centre of the mathematical shape is the same as a natural center. 

 <!-- and name it, or rather the fire which occupies that place, -->

But it is better to conceive of the case of the whole heaven as analogous to that of animals, in which the centre of the animal and that of the body are different.

This is why they have no need to be so disturbed about the world, or to call in a guard for its centre: rather let them look for the centre in the other sense and tell us what it is like and where nature has set it.

That centre will be something primary and precious; but to the mere position we should give the last place rather than the first.

For the middle is what is defined, and what defines it is the limit, and that which contains or limits is more precious than that which is limited, see ing that the latter is the matter and the former the essence of the system.


2. There is also no agreement whether the earth is moving or not. 

<!-- As to the position of the earth, then, this is the view which some advance, and the views advanced concerning its rest or motion are similar.  -->

<!-- For here too there is no general agreement.  -->

Those who deny that the earth lies at the centre think that it, and the counter-earth, revolve around the centre.

 <!-- and not the earth only but, as we said before,  as well.  -->

Some of them even consider it possible that there are several bodies so moving, which are invisible to us owing to the interposition of the earth. 

They say:
- this explains why the eclipses of the moon are more frequent than eclipses of the sun.
  - For in addition to the earth each of these moving bodies can obstruct it.
- the earth is far from the center by a full hemisphere

<!-- , there is no more difficulty, they think, in accounting for the observed facts on their view that we do not dwell at the centre, than on the common view that the earth is in the middle.  -->

<!-- Even as it is, there is nothing in the observations to suggest that we are removed from the centre by half the diameter of the earth. Others, again, say that  -->

In Timaeus,  the earth lies at the centre but is 'rolled' and thus in motion around the axis of the whole heaven


## The Shape of the Earth

3. Some think the Earth is spherical, others that it is flat and drum-shaped.

For evidence they bring the fact that, as the sun rises and sets, the part concealed by the earth shows a straight and not a curved edge.

If the earth were spherical, then the line of section would have to be circular. 

But they disregard:
- the great distance of the sun from the earth
- the great size of the circumference

When seen from afar on these apparently small circles, these appear straight. 

Such an appearance should not tomake them doubt the circular shape of the earth. 

They also say that because it is at rest, the earth must necessarily have this shape.

For there are many different ways in which the movement or rest of the earth has been conceived.

If you toss dust in the air, it should move if the earth were in motion. But it does not.

<!-- t would indeed be a complacent mind that felt no surprise that, while a little bit of earth, let loose in mid-air moves and will not stay still, and more there is of it the faster it moves, the whole earth, free in midair, should show no movement at all. -->

Yet here is this great weight of earth, and it is at rest.

If you remove the Earth, the dust will continue its downward movement. 

<!-- Again, from beneath one of these moving fragments of earth, before it falls, take away the earth, and it will continue its downward movement with nothing to stop it. -->

Some like Xenophanes of Colophon have asserted that the earth below us is infinite --- it has 'pushed its roots to infinity. This is to save the trouble of seeking for the cause.

Hence the sharp rebuke of Empedocles, in the words 'if the deeps of the earth are endless and endless the ample ether-such is the vain tale told by many a tongue, poured from the mouths of those who have seen but little of the whole. Others say the earth rests upon water.

This is the oldest theory that has been preserved, and is attributed to Thales of Miletus.

It says that the earth stays still because it floated like wood.

 <!-- which are so constituted as to rest upon but not upon air.  -->

As if the same account had not to be given of the water which carries the earth as of the earth itself! 

It is not the nature of water, any more than of earth, to stay in mid-air: it must have something to rest upon. 

Again, as air is lighter than water, so is water than earth: how then can they think that the naturally lighter substance lies below the heavier? 

If the earth as a whole can float on water, that must obviously be the case with any part of it. 

But observation shows that this is not the case. 

Any piece of earth goes to the bottom, the quicker the larger it is. 

These thinkers seem to push their inquiries some way into the problem, but not so far as they might. 

<!-- It is what we are all inclined to do, to direct our inquiry not by the matter itself, but by the views of our opponents: and even when interrogating oneself one pushes the inquiry only to the point at which one can no longer offer any opposition. Hence a good inquirer will be one who is ready in bringing forward the objections proper to the genus, and that he will be when he has gained an understanding of all the differences. -->
