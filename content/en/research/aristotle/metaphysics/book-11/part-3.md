<!-- qua being -->
Philosophy treats of 'being' universally and not as a part of something. 

 <!-- in respect of a part of it,  -->

The word 'being' is used in many senses. 
<!-- and in virtue of nothing common to its various uses, -->

If 'being' is used equivocally, as something that has nothing in common with others, then it does not fall under one science. This is because the meanings of an equivocal word do not form one genus.

But if 'being' is used as something common, then it will fall under one science. 

<!-- The term seems to be used in the way we have mentioned, like 'medical' and 'healthy'. For each of these also we use in many senses.  -->

<!-- Terms are used in this way by virtue of some kind of reference, in the one case to medical science, in the other to health, in others to something else, but in each case to one identical concept.  -->

A 'discussion' and a 'knife' are both called medical because:
- discussion comes from medical science [cause]
- knife is useful to medical science [effect] 

A thing is called healthy if:
- it is shows good health [effect]
- it produces good health [cause]

<!-- . And the same is true in the other cases.  -->

Everything that exists has 'being' in this same way. [Cause or effect]

 <!-- is, then, is said to 'be' in this same way;  -->

Each thing is to 'be' because it is:
- a modification of being, or
- a permanent or transient state, or
- a movement of it

 <!-- qua being or , or something else of the sort.  -->

Everything that exists may be referred to something single and common. Therefore, each of the differences may also be referred to the first differences of being. 

This is true whether the first differences of being are:
- plurality and unity, or
- likeness and unlikeness,
- some other differences.

<!-- let these be taken as already discussed.  -->

It does not matter whether 'be' refers:
- to being, or
- to unity. 

Existence as being is different from existence as unity. But at least they are convertible. Being can be thought of as unity, just as unity can be thought of as being. 

 <!-- ; for that which is one is also somehow being, and that which is being is one. -->

Every pair of differences is examined by one science. 

<!-- , and in each pair one term is the privative of the other though one might regarding some contraries raise the question, how they can be privately related, viz. those which have an intermediate, e.g. unjust and just-in all such cases one must maintain that the privation is not of the whole definition, but of the infima species.  -->


Let us define a just man as someone permanently obedient to the laws. In every case, the unjust man will not have this whole definition denied of him.

He might be merely 'deficient in obedience in some respect to the laws'. The privation will attach to him in this way and in all other cases.


Geometry is the science where in the mathematician investigates abstractions.

He first strips off all the sensible qualities such as:
- weight and lightness
- hardness and softness
- heat and cold
- other sensible contrarieties. 

He leaves only the quantitative and continuous qualities, sometimes in one to three dimensions.

<!-- , and the attributes of these qua quantitative and continuous.  -->

He does not consider them in any other respect. 

He examines:
- the relative positions of some their attributes
- the commensurabilities and incommensurabilities of others
- the ratios of others

<!-- But yet we posit one and the same science of all these things--) -->


The same is true with regard to being, which is investigated by philosophy.

The attributes of this in so far as it is being, and the contrarieties in it qua being, it is the business of no other science than philosophy to investigate; 

Physics studies things, not being. It studies sharing in movement.

Dialectics and Sophistry deals with the attributes of things but not their being*.

{{< n n="Superphysics studies things to solve problems, but Metaphysics studies things to create theories" >}}


<!-- that exist, but not of things qua being, and not with being itself in so far as it is being;  -->

Therefore, the philosopher studies the things we have named, in so far as they are being. 

Philosophy is the single science of things which are many and different in genus.

<!-- Since all that is is to 'be' in virtue of something single and common, though the term has many meanings, and contraries are in the same case (for they are referred to the first contrarieties and differences of being), 

 things of this sort can fall under one science, 

 the difficulty we stated at the beginning appears to be solved,-I mean the question how there can be a  -->
