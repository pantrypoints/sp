The one-sided theories which some people express about all things cannot be valid.

On the one hand, the theory that nothing is true.

They say that there is nothing to prevent every statement from being like the statement 'the diagonal of a square is commensurate with the side.

On the other hand, the theory that everything is true. 

These views are the same as that of Heraclitus. 

For he who says that all things are true and all are false also makes each of these statements separately, so that since they are impossible, the double statement must be impossible too.

There are obviously contradictories which cannot be at the same time true-nor on the other hand can all statements be false.

Yet this would seem more possible in the light of what has been said.*

{{< n n="Heraclitus simply means that the universe is subjective. What is true for you might be false for others. For example, you might think potato chips are more delicious than chocolates, while another might think this is false, and that chocolates are more delicious than potato chips.">}}


But against all such views we must postulate, as we said above' not that something is or is not, but that something has a meaning, so that we must argue from a definition, viz. by assuming what falsity or truth means. 

If that which it is true to affirm is nothing other than that which it is false to deny, it is impossible that all statements should be false; for one side of the contradiction must be true. 

If it is necessary with regard to everything either to assert or to deny it, it is impossible that both should be false; for it is one side of the contradiction that is false.-Therefore all such views are also exposed to the often expressed objection, that they destroy themselves. 

For he who says that everything is true makes even the statement contrary to his own true, and therefore his own not true. For the contrary statement denies that it is true. 

While he who says everything is false makes himself also false.

If the former person excepts the contrary statement, saying it alone is not true, while the latter excepts his own as being not false, none the less they are driven to postulate the truth or falsity of an infinite number of statements; for that which says the true statement is true is true, and this process will go on to infinity.

Those who say all things are at rest are not right, nor are those who say all things are in movement. 

For if all things are at rest, the same statements will always be true and the same always false,-but this obviously changes; for he who makes a statement, himself at one time was not and again will not be. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true; everything therefore will be false. 

But it has been shown that this is impossible. Again, it must be that which is that changes; for change is from something to something. But again it is not the case that all things are at rest or in motion sometimes, and nothing for ever; for there is something which always moves the things that are in motion, and the first mover is itself unmoved.
