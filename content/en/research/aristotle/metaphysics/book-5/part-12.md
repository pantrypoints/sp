'Potency' has many meanings:

1. A source of movement or change in a thing

 <!-- than the thing moved or in the same thing qua other; e.g.  -->

For example, the art of building is a potency which is not in the thing built.

The art of healing is a potency. It may be in the man healed. But it is not in him after he is healed. 

<!-- , but not in him qua healed.  -->

Thus, 'potency' generally means the source of change or movement.

 <!-- in another thing or in the same thing qua other, and also  -->


2. The source of a thing being moved by another thing

 <!-- or by itself qua other.  -->

<!-- For in virtue of that principle, in virtue of which  -->

A patient who suffers anything is 'capable' of suffering. This 'potency' is a capability. 

<!-- d this we do sometimes if it suffers anything at all, sometimes not in respect of everything it suffers, but only if it suffers a change for the better-- -->

3. The capacity of performing this well or according to intention

Sometimes, we say that a person who cannot walk or speak well cannot walk or speak. 

4. Passivity

5. An absolutely impassive or unchangeable state

This is when a thing cannot be easily changed for the worse.

Things are broken, crushed, and bent and in general destroyed by not having a potency. 

 <!-- by having a potency but by not having one and by lacking something. -->

Things are impassive when they are not affected or not so much affected by such breaking, crushing, and bending. 
 <!-- with respect to such processes if they are scarcely and slightly affected by them.  -->
- This is due to a 'potency' that puts them in some positive state.
- This lets the do something.  

 <!-- and because they 'can' do something and are in . -->


## Potency as Capability

Likewise, 'potent' or 'capable' in one sense means that which can begin a movement or a change in general.
- Even that which can bring things to rest is a 'potent' thing in itself.

<!-- In one sense that over which something else has such a potency; and in one sense that which has a potency of changing into something, whether for the worse or for the better (for  -->

Even that which perishes is 'capable' of perishing. 
- A thing would not have perished if it had not been capable of perishing. 
- It has a certain disposition, cause, and principle which fits it to suffer perishing. 

Some people think that it perishes because it has something.
- Others think that it perishes because it lacks something.

In this way, 'capable' is used in 2 senses:

1. Lack is 'habit'

In this case, everything will be capable by having something.
- In this way, things becaome capable both by having a positive habit and by principle [of potency]
- The lack of potency then leads to lack. 

 <!-- this, if it is possible to have a privation; -->

2. Lack is not 'habit'

<!-- , then 'capable' is used in 2 distinct senses) -->

In this case, a thing is capable because it or any other thing has a potency or principle which can destroy it. 
- It is capable either because the thing might merely chance to happen or not to happen

<!-- , or because it might do so well.  -->

This sort of potency is found even in lifeless things such as instruments.

We say one lyre can speak if it has a good tone. It cannot speak at all if it does not have a good tone.


## Incapacity 

Incapacity is lack of capacity.

It is used for things that would naturally have the capacity, but does not have it.

<!-- -i.e. of such a principle as has been described either in general or in the case of something that 

, or even at the time when it would naturally already have it;  -->

For example, a eunuch is 'incapable of begetting'. But it is a man which is usually capable of begetting. 

<!-- A boy, a man, and  are distinct from each other. -->

To either kind of capacity there is an opposite incapacity.

1. One incapacity prevents movement

This incapacity is called adunata

2. Another incapacity prevents good movement

<!-- both to that which only can produce movement and to that which can produce it well. -->


<!-- while others are so in another sense; i.e. both dunaton and adunaton are used as follows.  -->

## Adunata

The opposite of 'impossible' is that which is necessarily true
- For example, it is impossible for the diagonal of a square to be commensurate with its side.
  - The contrary of this is the possible.
<!--  because such a statement is a falsity of which the contrary is not only true but also necessary; 

that it is commensurate, then, is not only false but also of necessity false.  -->


'Possible', in one sense, means that which is not necessarily false.

- For example, it is possible for man to sit down. 
  - A man that is not seated is not necessarily false.

<!-- , is found when it is not necessary that the contrary is false, e.g. that a man should be seated is possible;  -->

<!-- ; in one, that which is true; -->

 <!-- in one, that which may be true. -->

A 'potency' or 'power' in geometry is so called by a change of meaning.

These senses of 'capable' or 'possible' involve no reference to potency. 

But the senses which involve a reference to potency all refer to the primary kind of potency.

This is a source of change in the thing or in another thing.
 <!-- or in the same thing qua other. -->

Some people call things as 'capable' when:
- something else has a potency over them, or
- something else has no potency over them
- something else has a potency over them in a particular way. 

The same is true of the things that are incapable. 

Therefore, the proper definition of the primary kind of potency is: '**a source of change in another thing or in the same thing qua other**'.
