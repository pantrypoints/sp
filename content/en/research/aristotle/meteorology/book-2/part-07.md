There are 3 current theories on earthquakes:


## 1. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae

Anaxagoras says that:
- the ether naturally moves upwards
- all of the earth is really equally porous, but its surface is clogged up by rain


The aether gets caught in hollows below the earth and so shakes it.*

{{< n n="This is correct, as the space particles in Cartesian Physics" >}}

The whole sphere of the Earth has:
- an 'above' where we live
- a 'below'

This theory is perhaps too primitive to require refutation. 

It is absurd to think of up and down otherwise than as meaning that heavy
bodies move to the earth from every quarter, and light ones, such
as fire, away from it; especially as we see that, as far as our knowledge
of the earth goes, the horizon always changes with a change in our
position, which proves that the earth is convex and spherical. 

It is absurd, too, to maintain that the earth rests on the air because
of its size, and then to say that impact upwards from below shakes
it right through. 

Besides he gives no account of the circumstances
attendant on earthquakes: for not every country or every season is
subject to them. 



## 2. Pre-Anaxagoras Anaximenes of Miletus

Anaximenes says that the earth breaks up when it grows wet or dry.

Earthquakes are due to the fall of these masses as they break away.

Hence earthquakes take place in times of drought and again of heavy rain, since the earth grows dry in time of drought and breaks up, whereas the rain makes it sodden and destroys its cohesion. 

But if this were the case the earth should be sinking in many places.

Why do earthquakes frequently occur in places which are not excessively subject to drought or rain, as they ought
to be on the theory? 

Earthquakes should always to be getting fewer, and should come to an end entirely some day.

The notion of contraction by packing together implies this. 

So this is impossible the theory must be impossible too. 



## 3. Democritus of Abdera

Democritus says that the earth is full of water.

When a quantity of rain-water is added to this, an earthquake is the result.

The hollows in the earth being unable to admit the excess of water it forces its way in and so causes an earthquake. Or again, the earth as it dries draws the water from the fuller to the emptier parts, and the inrush
of the water as it changes its place causes the earthquake.
