If the infinite does not exist, then there are many impossible consequences.

There will be a beginning and an end of
time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite. If,
then, in view of the above considerations, neither alternative seems possible, an arbiter
must be called in; and clearly there is a sense in which the infinite exists and another in
which it does not.

We must keep in mind that the word ‘is’ means either what potentially is or what fully
is. Further, a thing is infinite either by addition or by division.
Now, as we have seen, magnitude is not actually infinite. But by division it is infinite.
(There is no difficulty in refuting the theory of indivisible lines.) The alternative then
remains that the infinite has a potential existence.

But the phrase ‘potential existence’ is ambiguous. When we speak of the potential
existence of a statue we mean that there will be an actual statue. It is not so with the
infinite. There will not be an actual infinite. The word ‘is’ has many senses, and we say
that the infinite ‘is’ in the sense in which we say ‘it is day’ or ‘it is the games’, because
one thing after another is always coming into existence.

For of these things too the distinction between potential and actual existence holds. We
say that there are Olympic games, both in the sense that they may occur and that they are
actually occurring.

The infinite exhibits itself in different ways-in time, in the generations of man, and in
the division of magnitudes. For generally the infinite has this mode of existence: one
thing is always being taken after another, and each thing that is taken is always finite,
but always different. Again, ‘being’ has more than one sense, so that we must not regard
the infinite as a ‘this’, such as a man or a horse, but must suppose it to exist in the sense
in which we speak of the day or the games as existing things whose being has not come
to them like that of a substance, but consists in a process of coming to be or passing
away; definite if you like at each stage, yet always different.

But when this takes place in spatial magnitudes, what is taken perists, while in the
succession of time and of men it takes place by the passing away of these in such a way
that the source of supply never gives out.

In a way the infinite by addition is the same thing as the infinite by division.
In a finite magnitude, the infinite by addition comes about in a way inverse to that of the
other. For in proportion as we see division going on, in the same proportion we see
addition being made to what is already marked off. For if we take a determinate part of a
finite magnitude and add another part determined by the same ratio (not taking in the
same amount of the original whole), and so on, we shall not traverse the given
magnitude. But if we increase the ratio of the part, so as always to take in the same
amount, we shall traverse the magnitude, for every finite magnitude is exhausted by
means of any determinate quantity however small.

The infinite, then, exists in no other way, but in this way it does exist, potentially and by
reduction. It exists fully in the sense in which we say ‘it is day’ or ‘it is the games’; and
potentially as matter exists, not independently as what is finite does.

By addition then, also, there is potentially an infinite, namely, what we have described
as being in a sense the same as the infinite in respect of division. For it will always be possible to take something ah extra. Yet the sum of the parts taken will not exceed every
determinate magnitude, just as in the direction of division every determinate magnitude
is surpassed in smallness and there will be a smaller part.

But in respect of addition there cannot be an infinite which even potentially exceeds
every assignable magnitude, unless it has the attribute of being actually infinite, as the
physicists hold to be true of the body which is outside the world, whose essential nature
is air or something of the kind. But if there cannot be in this way a sensible body which
is infinite in the full sense, evidently there can no more be a body which is potentially
infinite in respect of addition, except as the inverse of the infinite by division, as we
have said. It is for this reason that Plato also made the infinites two in number, because
it is supposed to be possible to exceed all limits and to proceed ad infinitum in the
direction both of increase and of reduction. Yet though he makes the infinites two, he
does not use them. For in the numbers the infinite in the direction of reduction is not
present, as the monad is the smallest; nor is the infinite in the direction of increase, for
the parts number only up to the decad.

The infinite turns out to be the contrary of what it is said to be. It is not what has
nothing outside it that is infinite, but what always has something outside it.
This is indicated by the fact that rings also that have no bezel are described as ‘endless’,
because it is always possible to take a part which is outside a given part. The
description depends on a certain similarity, but it is not true in the full sense of the
word. This condition alone is not sufficient: it is necessary also that the next part which
is taken should never be the same. In the circle, the latter condition is not satisfied: it is
only the adjacent part from which the new part is different.
Our definition then is as follows:

A quantity is infinite if it is such that we can always take a part outside what has been
already taken. On the other hand, what has nothing outside it is complete and whole. For
thus we define the whole-that from which nothing is wanting, as a whole man or a
whole box. What is true of each particular is true of the whole as such-the whole is that
of which nothing is outside. On the other hand that from which something is absent and
outside, however small that may be, is not ‘all’. ‘Whole’ and ‘complete’ are either quite
identical or closely akin. Nothing is complete (teleion) which has no end (telos); and the
end is a limit.

Hence Parmenides must be thought to have spoken better than Melissus. The latter says
that the whole is infinite, but the former describes it as limited, ‘equally balanced from
the middle’. For to connect the infinite with the all and the whole is not like joining two
pieces of string; for it is from this they get the dignity they ascribe to the infinite-its
containing all things and holding the all in itself-from its having a certain similarity to
the whole. It is in fact the matter of the completeness which belongs to size, and what is
potentially a whole, though not in the full sense. It is divisible both in the direction of
reduction and of the inverse addition. It is a whole and limited; not, however, in virtue
of its own nature, but in virtue of what is other than it. It does not contain, but, in so far
as it is infinite, is contained. Consequently, also, it is unknowable, qua infinite; for the
matter has no form. (Hence it is plain that the infinite stands in the relation of part rather
than of whole. For the matter is part of the whole, as the bronze is of the bronze statue.)
If it contains in the case of sensible things, in the case of intelligible things the great and
the small ought to contain them. But it is absurd and impossible to suppose that the
unknowable and indeterminate should contain and determine.
