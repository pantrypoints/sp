<!-- The arguments that may be advanced against this position are not difficult to dispose of. -->


Motion may exist though at one time it had not existed at all.

This is because:

1. No process of change is eternal

The nature of all change is such that it proceeds from something to something, so that every process of change must be bounded by the contraries that mark its course, and no motion can go on to infinity. 

2. A thing that neither is in motion nor contains any motion within itself can be set in motion; e.g. inanimate things that are (whether the whole or some part is in question) not in motion but at rest, are at some moment set in motion:
whereas, if motion cannot have a becoming before which it had no being, these things
ought to be either always or never in motion.

3. The fact is evident above all in the case of animate beings.

Sometimes, there is no motion in us and we are quite still. Yet we are then at some moment set in motion. Sometimes, we produce a beginning of motion in ourselves spontaneously without anything having set us in motion from without.*

{{< n n="The cause of the motion is from the invisible aether" >}}


We see nothing like this in the case of inanimate things, which are always set in motion from outside.

The animal moves itself.

Therefore, if an animal is ever in a state of absolute rest, we have a motionless thing in which motion can be produced from the thing itself. 

If this can occur in an animal, why should not the same be true of the universe as a whole? 

If it can occur in a small world, it could also occur in a great one.

If it can occur in the world, it could also occur in the infinite if the infinite could as a whole possibly be in motion or at rest. 

These have objections:

1. The first-mentioned motion to opposites is not always the same and numerically one a correct statement.

This might be a necessary conclusion, provided that it is possible for the motion of that which is one and the same to be not always one and the same.

I mean that e.g. we may question whether the note given by a single string is one and the same, or is different each time the string is struck, although the string is in the same condition and is moved in the same way.

But still, however this may be, there is nothing to prevent there being a motion that is the same in virtue of being continuous and eternal.

 <!-- we shall have something to say later that will make this point clearer. -->

2. Something not in motion may be set in motion, that which caused the motion from without being at one time present, and at another absent. 

Nevertheless, how this can be so remains matter for inquiry; how it comes about, I mean, that the same motive force at one time causes a thing to be in motion, and at another does not do so: for the difficulty raised by our objector really amounts to this-why is it that some things are not always at rest, and the rest always in motion?

3. That which alleges that motion arises in things in which it did not exist before, and adduces in proof the case of animate things.

This is more difficult than the other objections.

Thus, an animal is first at rest and afterwards walks, not having been set in motion apparently by anything from without. 

This, however, is false because we observe that there is always some part of the animal’s organism in motion, and the cause of the motion of this part is not the animal itself, but, it may be, its environment.

Moreover, we say that the animal itself originates not all of its motions but its locomotion.

So it may well be the case-or rather we may perhaps say that it must necessarily be the case-that many motions are produced in the body by its environment, and some of these set in motion the intellect or the appetite.

This sets the whole animal in motion.

This is what happens when animals are asleep:
though there is then no perceptive motion in them, there is some motion that causes
them to wake up again. 

But we will leave this point also to be elucidated at a later stage in our discussion.
