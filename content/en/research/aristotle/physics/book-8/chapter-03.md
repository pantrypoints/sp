Why are some things in motion and at another are at rest again? 

1 of 3 things must be true:

1. All things are always at rest
2. All things are always in motion
3. Some things are in motion and others at rest
  - The things in motion are always in motion
  - The things at rest are always at rest, or
  - They are capable alike of motion and of rest

Some things in the world are always motionless, others always in motion, while others again admit of both conditions. 

This last is the account of the matter that we must give: for herein lies the solution of all the difficulties raised and the conclusion of the investigation upon which we are engaged.

To maintain that all things are at rest, and to disregard sense-perception in an attempt to
show the theory to be reasonable, would be an instance of intellectual weakness: it
would call in question a whole system, not a particular detail: moreover, it would be an
attack not only on the physicist but on almost all sciences and all received opinions,
since motion plays a part in all of them. 

Further, just as in arguments about mathematics
objections that involve first principles do not affect the mathematician-and the other
sciences are in similar case-so, too, objections involving the point that we have just
raised do not affect the physicist: for it is a fundamental assumption with him that motion is ultimately referable to nature herself.

The assertion that all things are in motion we may fairly regard as equally false, though it is less subversive of physical science: for though in our course on physics it was laid down that rest no less than motion is ultimately referable to nature herself, nevertheless motion is the characteristic fact of nature: moreover, the view is actually held by some that not merely some things but all things in the world are in motion and always in motion, though we cannot apprehend the fact by sense-perception. Although the supporters of this theory do not state clearly what kind of motion they mean, or whether they mean all kinds, it is no hard matter to reply to them: thus we may point out that there cannot be a continuous process either of increase or of decrease: that which comes between the two has to be included.

The theory resembles that about the stone being worn away by the drop of water or split by plants growing out of it: if so much has been extruded or removed by the drop, it does not follow that half the amount has previously been extruded or removed in half the time: the case of the hauled ship is exactly comparable: here we have so many drops setting so much in motion, but a part of them will not set as much in motion in any period of time. The amount removed is, it is true, divisible into a number of parts, but no one of these was set in motion separately: they were all set in motion together. It is evident, then, that from the fact that the decrease is divisible into an infinite number of parts it does not follow that some part must always be passing away: it all passes away at a particular moment. Similarly, too, in the case of any alteration whatever if that which suffers alteration is infinitely divisible it does not follow from this that the same is true of the alteration itself, which often occurs all at once, as in freezing.

Again, when any one has fallen ill, there must follow a period of time in which his
restoration to health is in the future: the process of change cannot take place in an
instant: yet the change cannot be a change to anything else but health. The assertion therefore, that alteration is continuous is an extravagant calling into question of the
obvious: for alteration is a change from one contrary to another.

Moreover, we notice that a stone becomes neither harder nor softer. Again, in the matter
of locomotion, it would be a strange thing if a stone could be falling or resting on the
ground without our being able to perceive the fact. Further, it is a law of nature that
earth and all other bodies should remain in their proper places and be moved from them
only by violence: from the fact then that some of them are in their proper places it
follows that in respect of place also all things cannot be in motion. These and other
similar arguments, then, should convince us that it is impossible either that all things
are always in motion or that all things are always at rest.

Nor again can it be that some things are always at rest, others always in motion, and
nothing sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion. This theory must be pronounced
impossible on the same grounds as those previously mentioned: viz. that we see the
above-mentioned changes occurring in the case of the same things. We may further
point out that the defender of this position is fighting against the obvious, for on this
theory there can be no such thing as increase: nor can there be any such thing as
compulsory motion, if it is impossible that a thing can be at rest before being set in
motion unnaturally. This theory, then, does away with becoming and perishing.

Motion is generally a sort of becoming and perishing.

That to which a thing changes comes to be, or occupancy of it comes to be, and that from which a thing changes ceases to be, or there ceases to be occupancy of it. 

There are cases of occasional motion and occasional rest.

What about the idea that all things are sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion?

We must take our start as before from the possibilities that we distinguished just above. Either all things are at rest, or all things are in motion, or some things are at rest and others in motion. 

If some things are at rest and others in motion, then it must be that either all things are sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion, or some things are always at rest and the remainder always in motion, or some of the things are always at rest and others always in motion while others again are sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion.

It is impossible that all things should be at rest: nevertheless we may now repeat that assertion. We may point out that, even if it is really the case, as certain persons assert, that the existent is infinite and motionless, it certainly does not appear to be so if we follow sense-perception: many things that exist
appear to be in motion.

If there is such a thing as false opinion or opinion at all, there is also motion; and similarly if there is such a thing as imagination, or if it is the case that anything seems to be different at different times: for imagination and opinion are thought to be motions of a kind. 

But to investigate this question at allto seek a reasoned justification of a belief with regard to which we are too well off to require reasoned justification-implies bad judgement of what is better and what is worse, what commends itself to belief and what does not, what is ultimate and what is not. It is likewise impossible that all things should be in motion or that some things should be always in motion and the remainder always at rest.

We have sufficient ground for rejecting all these theories in the single fact that we see
some things that are sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. 

It is no less impossible that some things should be always in motion and the remainder always at rest than that all things should be at rest or that all things should be in motion continuously. It remains, then, to consider whether all things are so constituted as to be capable both of being in motion and of being at rest, or whether, while some things are so constituted, some are always at rest and some are always in motion: for it is this last view that we have to show to be true.
