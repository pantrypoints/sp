Now of things that cause motion or suffer motion, to some the motion is accidental, to others essential: 

thus it is accidental to what merely belongs to or contains as a part a thing that causes motion or suffers motion, 

essential to a thing that causes motion or suffers motion not merely by belonging to such a thing or containing it as a part.

Of things to which the motion is essential some derive their motion from themselves, others from something else:

In some cases, their motion is natural, in others violent and unnatural. 

Thus in things that derive their motion from themselves, e.g. all animals, the motion is natural (for when an animal is in motion its motion is derived from itself): and whenever the source of the motion of a thing is in the thing itself we say that the motion of that thing is natural.

Therefore the animal as a whole moves itself naturally: but the body of the animal may be in motion unnaturally as well as naturally: it depends upon the kind of motion that it may chance to be suffering and the kind of element of which it is composed. 

The motion of things that derive their motion from something else is in some cases natural, in other unnatural: e.g. upward motion of earthy things and downward motion of fire are unnatural. Moreover the parts of animals are often in motion in an unnatural way, their positions and the character of the motion being abnormal. 

The fact that a thing that is in motion derives its motion from something is most evident in things that are in motion unnaturally, because in such cases it is clear that the motion is derived from something other than the thing itself. 

Next to things that are in motion unnaturally those whose motion while natural is derived from themselvese.g. animals-make this fact clear: for here the uncertainty is not as to whether the motion is derived from something but as to how we ought to distinguish in the thing between the movent and the moved. It would seem that in animals, just as in ships and things not naturally organized, that which causes motion is separate from that which suffers motion, and that it is only in this sense that the animal as a whole causes its own motion.

The greatest difficulty, however, is presented by the remaining case of those that we last distinguished. Where things derive their motion from something else we distinguished the cases in which the motion is unnatural: we are left with those that are to be contrasted with the others by reason of the fact that the motion is natural. 

It is in these cases that difficulty would be experienced in deciding whence the motion is derived, e.g. in the case of light and heavy things. When these things are in motion to positions the reverse of those they would properly occupy, their motion is violent: when they are in motion to their proper positionsthe light thing up and the heavy thing down-their motion is natural; but in this latter case it is no longer evident, as it is when the motion is unnatural, whence their motion is derived. It is impossible to say that their motion is derived from themselves: this is a characteristic of life and peculiar to living things.

Further, if it were, it would have been in their power to stop themselves (I mean that if e.g. a thing can cause itself to walk it can also cause itself not to walk), and so, since on this supposition fire itself possesses the power of upward locomotion, it is clear that it should also possess the power of downward locomotion. Moreover if things move themselves, it would be unreasonable to suppose that in only one kind of motion is their
motion derived from themselves. 

How can anything of continuous and naturally connected substance move itself? 

In so far as a thing is one and continuous not merely in virtue of contact, it is impassive: it is only in so far as a thing is divided that one part of it is by nature active and another passive. 

Therefore none of the things that we are now considering move themselves (for they are of naturally connected substance), nor does anything else that is continuous: in each case the movent must be separate from the moved, as we see to be the case with inanimate things when an animate thing moves them.

It is the fact that these things also always derive their motion from something: what it is would become evident if we were to distinguish the different kinds of cause. 

The above-mentioned distinctions can also be made in the case of things that cause motion: some of them are capable of causing motion unnaturally (e.g. the lever is not naturally capable of moving the weight), others naturally (e.g. what is actually hot is naturally capable of moving what is potentially hot): and similarly in the case of all
other things of this kind.

In the same way, too, what is potentially of a certain quality or of a certain quantity in a
certain place is naturally movable when it contains the corresponding principle in itself
and not accidentally (for the same thing may be both of a certain quality and of a certain
quantity, but the one is an accidental, not an essential property of the other). 


So when fire or earth is moved by something the motion is violent when it is unnatural, and natural when it brings to actuality the proper activities that they potentially possess. But the fact that the term ‘potentially’ is used in more than one sense is the reason why it is not evident whence such motions as the upward motion of fire and the downward motion of earth are derived. One who is learning a science potentially knows it in a different sense from one who while already possessing the knowledge is not actually exercising it.

Wherever we have something capable of acting and something capable of being correspondingly acted on, in the event of any such pair being in contact what is potential becomes at times actual: e.g. the learner becomes from one potential something another potential something: for one who possesses knowledge of a science but is not actually exercising it knows the science potentially in a sense, though not in the same sense as he knew it potentially before he learnt it.

When he is in this condition, if something does not prevent him, he actively exercises his knowledge: otherwise he would be in the contradictory state of not knowing. In regard to natural bodies also the case is similar.

Thus what is cold is potentially hot. A change takes place and it becomes fire. It burns unless something prevents and hinders it. 

So, too, with weight. Light is generated from heavy. For example, air is generated from water (for water is the first thing that is potentially light). Air is actually light and will at once realize its proper activity as such unless something prevents it. 

The activity of lightness consists in the light thing being in a certain situation, namely high up: when it is in the contrary situation, it is being prevented from rising. 

The case is similar also in regard to quantity and quality.


How can we account for the motion of light things and heavy things to their proper situations? 

They have a natural tendency respectively towards a certain position.

This constitutes the essence of lightness and heaviness.
- Lightness is determined by an upward tendency
- Heaviness is determined by a downward tendency

A thing may be potentially light or heavy in more senses than one.

Thus not only when a thing is water is it in a sense potentially light. 

But when it has become air it may be still potentially light: for it may be that through some hindrance it
does not occupy an upper position, whereas, if what hinders it is removed, it realizes its
activity and continues to rise higher. 

The process whereby what is of a certain quality changes to a condition of active existence is similar: thus the exercise of knowledge follows at once upon the possession of it unless something prevents it. So, too, what is of a certain quantity extends itself over a certain space unless something prevents it.

The thing in a sense is and in a sense is not moved by one who moves what is obstructing and preventing its motion (e.g. one who pulls away a pillar from under a roof or one who removes a stone from a wineskin in the water is the accidental cause of motion): 

**In the same way, the real cause of the motion of a ball rebounding from a wall is not the wall but the thrower.**

In all these cases, the thing does not move itself. But it contains within itself the source of motion-not of moving something or of causing motion, but of suffering it.

The motion of all moving things is either:
- natural or
- unnatural and violent

All things moving with a violent and unnatural motion are moved by something other than themselves.

All things moving with a natural motion are also moved by something other than themselves.

<!-- -both those that are moved by themselves and those that are not moved by themselves (e.g. light things and heavy things, which are moved either by that
which brought the thing into existence as such and made it light and heavy, or by that
which released what was hindering and preventing it);  -->

Then all moving things are moved by something.
