The first movement must be without parts and without magnitude.

This is based on the following premises:

1. Nothing finite can cause motion during an infinite time.

We have 3 things:
- the movement
- the moved
- time when the motion takes place

These are either all infinite or all finite or partly-that is to say two of them or one of them-finite and partly infinite.

Let A be the movement, B the moved, and G the infinite time. Now let us suppose that
D moves E, a part of B. Then the time occupied by this motion cannot be equal to G: for
the greater the amount moved, the longer the time occupied. It follows that the time Z is
not infinite. 

By continuing to add to D, I shall use up A and by continuing to add to E, I shall use up B: but I shall not use up the time by continually subtracting a corresponding amount from it, because it is infinite. Consequently the duration of the part of G which is occupied by all A in moving the whole of B, will be
finite.

Therefore a finite thing cannot impart to anything an infinite motion. It is clear,
then, that it is impossible for the finite to cause motion during an infinite time.

In no case is it possible for an infinite force to reside in a finite magnitude. This can be shown as follows: we take it for granted that the greater force is always that which in less time than another does an equal amount of work when engaged in any activity-in heating, for example, or sweetening or throwing; in fact, in
causing any kind of motion.

Then that on which the forces act must be affected to some extent by our supposed finite magnitude possessing an infinite force as well as by anything else, in fact to a greater extent than by anything else, since the infinite force is greater than any other.

But then there cannot be any time in which its action could take place. Suppose that A is the time occupied by the infinite power in the performance of an act of heating or pushing, and that AB is the time occupied by a finite power in the performance of the same act: 

Then by adding to the latter another finite power and continually increasing the magnitude of the power so added I shall at some time or other
reach a point at which the finite power has completed the motive act in the time A: for
by continual addition to a finite magnitude I must arrive at a magnitude that exceeds any
assigned limit, and in the same way by continual subtraction I must arrive at one that
falls short of any assigned limit. 

So we get the result that the finite force will occupy the
same amount of time in performing the motive act as the infinite force. But this is
impossible.

Therefore nothing finite can possess an infinite force. So it is also
impossible for a finite force to reside in an infinite magnitude. It is true that a greater
force can reside in a lesser magnitude: but the superiority of any such greater force can
be still greater if the magnitude in which it resides is greater. Now let AB be an infinite
magnitude. 

Then BG possesses a certain force that occupies a certain time, let us say the
time Z in moving D. Now if I take a magnitude twice as great at BG, the time occupied
by this magnitude in moving D will be half of EZ (assuming this to be the proportion):
so we may call this time ZH. 

That being so, by continually taking a greater magnitude in
this way I shall never arrive at the full AB, whereas I shall always be getting a lesser
fraction of the time given. 

Therefore the force must be infinite, since it exceeds any finite force. 

Moreover the time occupied by the action of any finite force must also be finite: for if a given force moves something in a certain time, a greater force will do so in a lesser time, but still a definite time, in inverse proportion. But a force must always be infinite-just as a number or a magnitude is-if it exceeds all definite limits. 

This point may also be proved in another way-by taking a finite magnitude in which there resides a force the same in kind as that which resides in the infinite magnitude, so that this force will be a measure of the finite force residing in the infinite magnitude.

It is impossible for an infinite force to reside in a finite magnitude or for a finite force to reside in an infinite magnitude. But before proceeding to our conclusion it will be well to discuss a difficulty that arises in connexion with locomotion.

If everything that is in motion with the exception of things that move themselves is moved by something else, how is it that some things, e.g. things thrown, continue to be in motion when their movent is no longer in contact with them? 

If we say that the movent in such cases moves something else at the same time, that the thrower e.g. also moves the air, and that this in being moved is also a movent, then it would be no more possible for this second thing than for the original thing to be in motion when the original movent is not in contact with it or moving it: all the things moved would have to be in motion simultaneously and also to have ceased simultaneously to be in motion when the original movent ceases to move them, even if, like the magnet, it makes that which it has moved capable of being a movent. 

Therefore, while we must accept this explanation to the extent of saying that the original movent gives the power of being a movent either to air or to water or to something else of the kind, naturally adapted for imparting and undergoing motion, we must say further that this thing does not cease simultaneously to impart motion and to undergo motion: it ceases to be in motion at the moment when its movent ceases to move it, but it still remains a movent, and so it causes something else consecutive with it to be in motion, and of this again the same may be said. 

The motion begins to cease when the motive force produced in one member of the consecutive series is at each stage less than that possessed by the preceding member, and it finally ceases when one member no longer causes the next member to be a movent but only causes it to be in motion.

The motion of  these last two-of the one as movent and of the other as moved-must cease simultaneously, and with this the whole motion ceases. 

The things in which this motion is produced are things that admit of being sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest, and the motion is not continuous but only appears so: for it is motion of things that are either successive or in contact, there being not one movent but a number of movents consecutive with one another: and so motion of this kind takes place in air and water.

Some say that it is ‘mutual replacement’: but we must recognize that the difficulty raised cannot be solved otherwise than in the way we have described. 

So far as they are affected by ‘mutual replacement’, all the members of the series are moved and impart motion simultaneously, so that their motions also cease simultaneously: but our present problem concerns the appearance of continuous motion in a single thing.

Therefore, since it cannot be moved throughout its motion by the same movent, the question is, what moves it? 

Resuming our main argument, we proceed from the positions that there must be continuous motion in the world of things, that this is a single motion, that a single motion must be a motion of a magnitude (for that which is without magnitude cannot be in motion), and that the magnitude must be a single magnitude moved by a
single movent (for otherwise there will not be continuous motion but a consecutive
series of separate motions), and that if the movement is a single thing, it is either itself
in motion or itself unmoved: if, then, it is in motion, it will have to be subject to the
same conditions as that which it moves, that is to say it will itself be in process of
change and in being so will also have to be moved by something: so we have a series
that must come to an end, and a point will be reached at which motion is imparted by
something that is unmoved. Thus we have a movent that has no need to change along
with that which it moves but will be able to cause motion always (for the causing of motion under these conditions involves no effort):

This motion alone is regular, or at least it is so in a higher degree than any other, since the movent is never subject to any change. So, too, in order that the motion may continue to be of the same character, the moved must not be subject to change in respect of its relation to the movent.

Moreover, the movent must occupy either the centre or the circumference, since these are the first principles from which a sphere is derived. But the things nearest the movent are those
whose motion is quickest, and in this case it is the motion of the circumference that is
the quickest: 

Therefore the movent occupies the circumference.

There is a further difficulty in supposing it to be possible for anything that is in motion to cause motion continuously and not merely in the way in which it is caused by something repeatedly pushing (in which case the continuity amounts to no more than successiveness). 

Such a movent must either itself continue to push or pull or perform both these actions, or else the action must be taken up by something else and be passed on from one movent to another (the process that we described before as occurring in the case of things thrown, since the air or the water, being divisible, is a movent only in virtue of the fact that different parts of the air are moved one after another): and in either
case the motion cannot be a single motion, but only a consecutive series of motions. 

The only continuous motion, then, is that which is caused by the unmoved movent: and this motion is continuous because the movent remains always invariable, so that its relation to that which it moves remains also invariable and continuous.

These points are settled, it is clear that the first unmoved movent cannot have any magnitude. For if it has magnitude, this must be either a finite or an infinite magnitude.

There cannot be an infinite magnitude.

It is impossible for a finite magnitude to have an infinite force.

It is impossible for a thing to be moved by a finite magnitude during an infinite time. 

But the first movent causes a motion that is eternal and does cause it during an infinite time. It is clear, therefore, that the first movent is indivisible and is without parts and without magnitude.
