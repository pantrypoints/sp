### Chapter 7

In all the figures, whenever a proper syllogism does not result, if both the terms are affirmative or negative nothing necessary follows at all. 

But if one is affirmative, the other negative, and if the negative is stated universally, a syllogism always results relating the minor to the major term, e.g. if A belongs to all or some B, and B belongs to no C: for if the premises are converted it is necessary that C does not belong to some A.

Similarly also in the other figures. A syllogism always results by means of conversion.

The substitution of an indefinite for a particular affirmative will effect the same syllogism in all the figures.

All the imperfect syllogisms are made perfect by means of the first figure. 

For all are brought to a conclusion either ostensively or per impossibile. In both ways the first figure is formed: if they are made perfect ostensively, because (as we saw) all are brought to a
conclusion by means of conversion, and conversion produces the first figure: if they are proved
per impossibile, because on the assumption of the false statement the syllogism comes about by
means of the first figure, e.g. in the last figure, if A and B belong to all C, it follows that A
belongs to some B: for if A belonged to no B, and B belongs to all C, A would belong to no C:
but (as we stated) it belongs to all C. Similarly also with the rest.


It is possible also to reduce all syllogisms to the universal syllogisms in the first figure. Those in the second figure are clearly made perfect by these, though not all in the same way; the universal syllogisms are made perfect by converting the negative premise, each of the particular syllogisms by reductio ad impossibile.

In the first figure particular syllogisms are indeed made perfect by themselves, but it is possible also to prove them by means of the second figure, reducing them ad
impossibile, e.g. if A belongs to all B, and B to some C, it follows that A belongs to some C. For
if it belonged to no C, and belongs to all B, then B will belong to no C: this we know by means
of the second figure. 

Similarly also demonstration will be possible in the case of the negative.

For if A belongs to no B, and B belongs to some C, A will not belong to some C: for if it
belonged to all C, and belongs to no B, then B will belong to no C: and this (as we saw) is the
middle figure. Consequently, since all syllogisms in the middle figure can be reduced to
universal syllogisms in the first figure, and since particular syllogisms in the first figure can be
reduced to syllogisms in the middle figure, it is clear that particular syllogisms can be reduced to
universal syllogisms in the first figure. Syllogisms in the third figure, if the terms are universal,
are directly made perfect by means of those syllogisms; but, when one of the premises is
particular, by means of the particular syllogisms in the first figure: and these (we have seen) may
be reduced to the universal syllogisms in the first figure: consequently also the particular
syllogisms in the third figure may be so reduced. It is clear then that all syllogisms may be
reduced to the universal syllogisms in the first figure.
We have stated then how syllogisms which prove that something belongs or does not belong to
something else are constituted, both how syllogisms of the same figure are constituted in
themselves, and how syllogisms of different figures are related to one another.


### Chapter 8

There is a difference according as something:
- belongs
- necessarily belongs, or
- may belong to something else 

Many things belong, but not necessarily. Others belong neither necessarily nor at all.

But it is possible for them to belong.

There will be different syllogisms to prove each of these relations, and syllogisms with differently related terms, one syllogism concluding from what is necessary, another from what is, a third from what is possible.

There is hardly any difference between syllogisms from necessary premises and syllogisms from
premises which merely assert.

When the terms are put in the same way, then, whether something belongs or necessarily belongs (or does not belong) to something else, a syllogism will or will not result alike in both cases, the only difference being the addition of the expression 'necessarily' to the terms. For the negative statement is convertible alike in both cases, and we should give the same account of the expressions 'to be contained in something as in a whole' and 'to be predicated of all of something'. 

With the exceptions to be made below, the conclusion will be proved to be necessary by means of conversion, in the same manner as in the case of simple predication. 

But in the middle figure when the universal statement is affirmative, and the particular negative, and again in the third figure when the universal is affirmative and the particular negative, the demonstration will not take the same form, but it is necessary by the 'exposition' of a part of the subject of the particular negative proposition, to which the predicate does not belong, to make the syllogism in reference to this: with terms so chosen the conclusion will necessarily follow. But if the relation is necessary in respect of the part taken, it must hold of some of that term in which this part is included: for the part taken is just some of that. 

Each of the resulting syllogisms is in the appropriate figure.
