### Chapter 17 

In the second figure whenever both premises are problematic, no syllogism is possible, whether
the premises are affirmative or negative, universal or particular. But when one premise is
assertoric, the other problematic, if the affirmative is assertoric no syllogism is possible, but if the universal negative is assertoric a conclusion can always be drawn. Similarly when one
premise is necessary, the other problematic. Here also we must understand the term 'possible' in
the conclusion, in the same sense as before.

First we must point out that the negative problematic proposition is not convertible, e.g. if A may
belong to no B, it does not follow that B may belong to no A. For suppose it to follow and
assume that B may belong to no A. Since then problematic affirmations are convertible with
negations, whether they are contraries or contradictories, and since B may belong to no A, it is
clear that B may belong to all A. But this is false: for if all this can be that, it does not follow that all that can be this: consequently the negative proposition is not convertible.

Further, these propositions are not incompatible, 'A may belong to no B', 'B necessarily does not belong to some of the As'; e.g. it is possible that no man should be white (for it is also possible that every man should be white), but it is not true to say that it is possible that no white thing should be a man: for many white things are necessarily not men, and the necessary (as we saw) other than the possible.

It is not possible to prove the convertibility of these propositions by a reductio ad
absurdum, i.e. by claiming assent to the following argument: 'since it is false that B may belong
to no A, it is true that it cannot belong to no A, for the one statement is the contradictory of the other.

But if this is so, it is true that B necessarily belongs to some of the As: consequently A
necessarily belongs to some of the Bs. But this is impossible.' The argument cannot be admitted,
for it does not follow that some A is necessarily B, if it is not possible that no A should be B. 

For the latter expression is used in two senses, one if A some is necessarily B, another if some A is necessarily not B. For it is not true to say that that which necessarily does not belong to some of the As may possibly not belong to any A, just as it is not true to say that what necessarily belongs to some A may possibly belong to all A. If any one then should claim that because it is not possible for C to belong to all D, it necessarily does not belong to some D, he would make a false assumption: for it does belong to all D, but because in some cases it belongs necessarily,
therefore we say that it is not possible for it to belong to all. Hence both the propositions 'A
necessarily belongs to some B' and 'A necessarily does not belong to some B' are opposed to the
proposition 'A belongs to all B'. Similarly also they are opposed to the proposition 'A may belong
to no B'. It is clear then that in relation to what is possible and not possible, in the sense
originally defined, we must assume, not that A necessarily belongs to some B, but that A
necessarily does not belong to some B. But if this is assumed, no absurdity results: consequently
no syllogism. It is clear from what has been said that the negative proposition is not convertible.

This being proved, suppose it possible that A may belong to no B and to all C. By means of
conversion no syllogism will result: for the major premise, as has been said, is not convertible.
Nor can a proof be obtained by a reductio ad absurdum: for if it is assumed that B can belong to
all C, no false consequence results: for A may belong both to all C and to no C. In general, if
there is a syllogism, it is clear that its conclusion will be problematic because neither of the
premises is assertoric; and this must be either affirmative or negative. But neither is possible.
Suppose the conclusion is affirmative: it will be proved by an example that the predicate cannot
belong to the subject. Suppose the conclusion is negative: it will be proved that it is not 
20
problematic but necessary. Let A be white, B man, C horse. It is possible then for A to belong to
all of the one and to none of the other. But it is not possible for B to belong nor not to belong to
C. That it is not possible for it to belong, is clear. For no horse is a man. Neither is it possible for it not to belong. For it is necessary that no horse should be a man, but the necessary we found to
be different from the possible. No syllogism then results. A similar proof can be given if the
major premise is negative, the minor affirmative, or if both are affirmative or negative. The
demonstration can be made by means of the same terms. And whenever one premise is universal,
the other particular, or both are particular or indefinite, or in whatever other way the premises
can be altered, the proof will always proceed through the same terms. Clearly then, if both the
premises are problematic, no syllogism results.


### Chapter 18

But if one premise is assertoric, the other problematic, if the affirmative is assertoric and the
negative problematic no syllogism will be possible, whether the premises are universal or
particular. The proof is the same as above, and by means of the same terms. But when the
affirmative premise is problematic, and the negative assertoric, we shall have a syllogism.
Suppose A belongs to no B, but can belong to all C. If the negative proposition is converted, B
will belong to no A. But ex hypothesi can belong to all C: so a syllogism is made, proving by
means of the first figure that B may belong to no C. Similarly also if the minor premise is
negative.

But if both premises are negative, one being assertoric, the other problematic, nothing
follows necessarily from these premises as they stand, but if the problematic premise is
converted into its complementary affirmative a syllogism is formed to prove that B may belong
to no C, as before: for we shall again have the first figure. But if both premises are affirmative,
no syllogism will be possible. 

This arrangement of terms is possible both when the relation is
positive, e.g. health, animal, man, and when it is negative, e.g. health, horse, man.
The same will hold good if the syllogisms are particular. Whenever the affirmative proposition is
assertoric, whether universal or particular, no syllogism is possible (this is proved similarly and
by the same examples as above), but when the negative proposition is assertoric, a conclusion
can be drawn by means of conversion, as before. Again if both the relations are negative, and the
assertoric proposition is universal, although no conclusion follows from the actual premises, a
syllogism can be obtained by converting the problematic premise into its complementary
affirmative as before. But if the negative proposition is assertoric, but particular, no syllogism is possible, whether the other premise is affirmative or negative. Nor can a conclusion be drawn
when both premises are indefinite, whether affirmative or negative, or particular. The proof is the
same and by the same terms.
