If one of the premises is necessary, the other problematic, then if the negative is necessary a
syllogistic conclusion can be drawn, not merely a negative problematic but also a negative
assertoric conclusion; 

But if the affirmative premise is necessary, no conclusion is possible.
Suppose that A necessarily belongs to no B, but may belong to all C. If the negative premise is
converted B will belong to no A: but A ex hypothesi is capable of belonging to all C: so once
more a conclusion is drawn by the first figure that B may belong to no C. But at the same time it
is clear that B will not belong to any C. 

For assume that it does: then if A cannot belong to any
B, and B belongs to some of the Cs, A cannot belong to some of the Cs: but ex hypothesi it may belong to all. A similar proof can be given if the minor premise is negative. Again let the
affirmative proposition be necessary, and the other problematic; i.e. suppose that A may belong
to no B, but necessarily belongs to all C. 

When the terms are arranged in this way, no syllogism
is possible. For (1) it sometimes turns out that B necessarily does not belong to C. Let A be
white, B man, C swan. White then necessarily belongs to swan, but may belong to no man; and
man necessarily belongs to no swan; Clearly then we cannot draw a problematic conclusion; for
that which is necessary is admittedly distinct from that which is possible. (2) Nor again can we
draw a necessary conclusion: for that presupposes that both premises are necessary, or at any rate
the negative premise. 

(3) Further it is possible also, when the terms are so arranged, that B
should belong to C: for nothing prevents C falling under B, A being possible for all B, and
necessarily belonging to C; e.g. if C stands for 'awake', B for 'animal', A for 'motion'. For motion necessarily belongs to what is awake, and is possible for every animal: and everything that is awake is animal.

The conclusion cannot be the negative assertion, if the relation
must be positive when the terms are related as above. Nor can the opposite affirmations be
established: consequently no syllogism is possible. A similar proof is possible if the major
premise is affirmative.

But if the premises are similar in quality, when they are negative a syllogism can always be
formed by converting the problematic premise into its complementary affirmative as before.
Suppose A necessarily does not belong to B, and possibly may not belong to C: if the premises
are converted B belongs to no A, and A may possibly belong to all C: thus we have the first
figure. 

Similarly if the minor premise is negative. But if the premises are affirmative there cannot be a syllogism.

The conclusion cannot be a negative assertoric or a negative necessary proposition because no negative premise has been laid down either in the assertoric or in the necessary mode. Nor can the conclusion be a problematic negative proposition. 

For if the terms are so related, there are cases in which B necessarily will not belong to C; e.g. suppose that A is white, B swan, C man. Nor can the opposite affirmations be established, since we have shown a case in which B necessarily does not belong to C. A syllogism then is not possible at all.

Similar relations will obtain in particular syllogisms. For whenever the negative proposition is
universal and necessary, a syllogism will always be possible to prove both a problematic and a
negative assertoric proposition (the proof proceeds by conversion); but when the affirmative
proposition is universal and necessary, no syllogistic conclusion can be drawn. 

This can be proved in the same way as for universal propositions, and by the same terms. Nor is a syllogistic conclusion possible when both premises are affirmative: this also may be proved as above. 

But when both premises are negative, and the premise that definitely disconnects two terms is
universal and necessary, though nothing follows necessarily from the premises as they are stated,
a conclusion can be drawn as above if the problematic premise is converted into its
complementary affirmative. But if both are indefinite or particular, no syllogism can be formed.

The same proof will serve, and the same terms.

If the universal and negative premise is necessary, a syllogism is always possible, proving not merely a negative problematic, but also a negative
assertoric proposition; but if the affirmative premise is necessary no conclusion can be drawn. It
is clear too that a syllogism is possible or not under the same conditions whether the mode of the
premises is assertoric or necessary. And it is clear that all the syllogisms are imperfect, and are completed by means of the figures mentioned.
