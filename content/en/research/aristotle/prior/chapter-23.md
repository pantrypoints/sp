### Chapter 23

The syllogisms in these figures are made perfect by means of universal syllogisms in the first figure and are reduced to them. That every syllogism without qualification can be so treated, will be clear presently, when it has been proved that every syllogism is formed through one or other of these figures.

It is necessary that every demonstration and every syllogism should prove either that something
belongs or that it does not, and this either universally or in part, and further either ostensively or hypothetically.

One sort of hypothetical proof is the reductio ad impossibile. Let us speak first of ostensive syllogisms: for after these have been pointed out the truth of our contention will be clear with regard to those which are proved per impossibile, and in general hypothetically.

If then one wants to prove syllogistically A of B, either as an attribute of it or as not an attribute of it, one must assert something of something else. If now A should be asserted of B, the
proposition originally in question will have been assumed. But if A should be asserted of C, but
C should not be asserted of anything, nor anything of it, nor anything else of A, no syllogism will
be possible. For nothing necessarily follows from the assertion of some one thing concerning
some other single thing. Thus we must take another premise as well. If then A be asserted of
something else, or something else of A, or something different of C, nothing prevents a
syllogism being formed, but it will not be in relation to B through the premises taken. Nor when
C belongs to something else, and that to something else and so on, no connection however being
made with B, will a syllogism be possible concerning A in its relation to B. For in general we
stated that no syllogism can establish the attribution of one thing to another, unless some middle
term is taken, which is somehow related to each by way of predication. For the syllogism in
general is made out of premises, and a syllogism referring to this out of premises with the same
reference, and a syllogism relating this to that proceeds through premises which relate this to
that. But it is impossible to take a premise in reference to B, if we neither affirm nor deny
anything of it; or again to take a premise relating A to B, if we take nothing common, but affirm
or deny peculiar attributes of each. So we must take something midway between the two, which
will connect the predications, if we are to have a syllogism relating this to that. If then we must
take something common in relation to both, and this is possible in three ways (either by
predicating A of C, and C of B, or C of both, or both of C), and these are the figures of which we
have spoken, it is clear that every syllogism must be made in one or other of these figures. The
argument is the same if several middle terms should be necessary to establish the relation to B;
for the figure will be the same whether there is one middle term or many.

The ostensive syllogisms are effected by means of the aforesaid figures; these considerations will show that reductiones ad also are effected in the same way. For all who effect an argument per impossibile infer syllogistically what is false, and prove the original conclusion hypothetically when something impossible results from the assumption of its contradictory; e.g.
that the diagonal of the square is incommensurate with the side, because odd numbers are equal
to evens if it is supposed to be commensurate. One infers syllogistically that odd numbers come
out equal to evens, and one proves hypothetically the incommensurability of the diagonal, since a
falsehood results through contradicting this. For this we found to be reasoning per impossibile,
viz. proving something impossible by means of an hypothesis conceded at the beginning.
Consequently, since the falsehood is established in reductions ad impossibile by an ostensive
syllogism, and the original conclusion is proved hypothetically, and we have already stated that
ostensive syllogisms are effected by means of these figures, it is evident that syllogisms per
impossibile also will be made through these figures. Likewise all the other hypothetical
syllogisms: for in every case the syllogism leads up to the proposition that is substituted for the
original thesis; but the original thesis is reached by means of a concession or some other
hypothesis. But if this is true, every demonstration and every syllogism must be formed by
means of the three figures mentioned above. But when this has been shown it is clear that every
syllogism is perfected by means of the first figure and is reducible to the universal syllogisms in this figure.

Chapter 24

Further in every syllogism one of the premises must be affirmative, and universality must be
present: unless one of the premises is universal either a syllogism will not be possible, or it will
not refer to the subject proposed, or the original position will be begged. Suppose we have to
prove that pleasure in music is good. If one should claim as a premise that pleasure is good
without adding 'all', no syllogism will be possible; if one should claim that some pleasure is
good, then if it is different from pleasure in music, it is not relevant to the subject proposed; if it
is this very pleasure, one is assuming that which was proposed at the outset to be proved. This is
more obvious in geometrical proofs, e.g. that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are
equal. Suppose the lines A and B have been drawn to the center. If then one should assume that
the angle AC is equal to the angle BD, without claiming generally that angles of semicircles are
equal; and again if one should assume that the angle C is equal to the angle D, without the
additional assumption that every angle of a segment is equal to every other angle of the same
segment; and further if one should assume that when equal angles are taken from the whole
angles, which are themselves equal, the remainders E and F are equal, he will beg the thing to be
proved, unless he also states that when equals are taken from equals the remainders are equal.
It is clear then that in every syllogism there must be a universal premise, and that a universal
statement is proved only when all the premises are universal, while a particular statement is
proved both from two universal premises and from one only: consequently if the conclusion is
universal, the premises also must be universal, but if the premises are universal it is possible that
the conclusion may not be universal. And it is clear also that in every syllogism either both or
one of the premises must be like the conclusion. I mean not only in being affirmative or negative,
but also in being necessary, pure, problematic. We must consider also the other forms of
predication.
It is clear also when a syllogism in general can be made and when it cannot; and when a valid,
when a perfect syllogism can be formed; and that if a syllogism is formed the terms must be
arranged in one of the ways that have been mentioned.
