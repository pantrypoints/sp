### Chapter 31

Division into classes is a small part of the method we have described: for division is, so to speak, a weak syllogism; for what it ought to prove, it begs, and it always
establishes something more general than the attribute in question. 

First, this very point had escaped all those who used the method of division; and they attempted to persuade men that it was possible to make a demonstration of substance and essence. Consequently they did not understand what it is possible to prove syllogistically by division, nor did they understand that it was possible to prove syllogistically in the manner we have described. 

In demonstrations, when there is a need to prove a positive statement, the middle term through which the syllogism is
formed must always be inferior to and not comprehend the first of the extremes. But division has
a contrary intention: for it takes the universal as middle. Let animal be the term signified by A, mortal by B, and immortal by C, and let man, whose definition is to be got, be signified by D.
The man who divides assumes that every animal is either mortal or immortal: i.e. whatever is A
is all either B or C. Again, always dividing, he lays it down that man is an animal, so he assumes 

A of D as belonging to it. Now the true conclusion is that every D is either B or C, consequently
man must be either mortal or immortal, but it is not necessary that man should be a mortal
animal-this is begged: and this is what ought to have been proved syllogistically. And again,
taking A as mortal animal, B as footed, C as footless, and D as man, he assumes in the same way
that A inheres either in B or in C (for every mortal animal is either footed or footless), and he
assumes A of D (for he assumed man, as we saw, to be a mortal animal); consequently it is
necessary that man should be either a footed or a footless animal; but it is not necessary that man
should be footed: this he assumes: and it is just this again which he ought to have demonstrated.
Always dividing then in this way it turns out that these logicians assume as middle the universal
term, and as extremes that which ought to have been the subject of demonstration and the
differentiae.

In conclusion, they do not make it clear, and show it to be necessary, that this is man or whatever the subject of inquiry may be: for they pursue the other method altogether, never
even suspecting the presence of the rich supply of evidence which might be used. It is clear that
it is neither possible to refute a statement by this method of division, nor to draw a conclusion
about an accident or property of a thing, nor about its genus, nor in cases in which it is unknown
whether it is thus or thus, e.g. whether the diagonal is incommensurate. For if he assumes that
every length is either commensurate or incommensurate, and the diagonal is a length, he has
proved that the diagonal is either incommensurate or commensurate. But if he should assume
that it is incommensurate, he will have assumed what he ought to have proved. He cannot then
prove it: for this is his method, but proof is not possible by this method. Let A stand for
'incommensurate or commensurate', B for 'length', C for 'diagonal'. It is clear then that this
method of investigation is not suitable for every inquiry, nor is it useful in those cases in which it is thought to be most suitable.

From what has been said it is clear from what elements demonstrations are formed and in what
manner, and to what points we must look in each problem.


### Chapter 32

Our next business is to state how we can reduce syllogisms to the aforementioned figures: for
this part of the inquiry still remains. If we should investigate the production of the syllogisms
and had the power of discovering them, and further if we could resolve the syllogisms produced
into the aforementioned figures, our original problem would be brought to a conclusion. It will
happen at the same time that what has been already said will be confirmed and its truth made
clearer by what we are about to say. For everything that is true must in every respect agree with
itself First then we must attempt to select the two premises of the syllogism (for it is easier to
divide into large parts than into small, and the composite parts are larger than the elements out of
which they are made); next we must inquire which are universal and which particular, and if both
premises have not been stated, we must ourselves assume the one which is missing. For
sometimes men put forward the universal premise, but do not posit the premise which is
contained in it, either in writing or in discussion: or men put forward the premises of the
principal syllogism, but omit those through which they are inferred, and invite the concession of
others to no purpose. We must inquire then whether anything unnecessary has been assumed, or
anything necessary has been omitted, and we must posit the one and take away the other, until
we have reached the two premises: for unless we have these, we cannot reduce arguments put
forward in the way described. In some arguments it is easy to see what is wanting, but some
escape us, and appear to be syllogisms, because something necessary results from what has been 
34
laid down, e.g. if the assumptions were made that substance is not annihilated by the annihilation
of what is not substance, and that if the elements out of which a thing is made are annihilated,
then that which is made out of them is destroyed: these propositions being laid down, it is
necessary that any part of substance is substance; this has not however been drawn by syllogism
from the propositions assumed, but premises are wanting. Again if it is necessary that animal
should exist, if man does, and that substance should exist, if animal does, it is necessary that
substance should exist if man does: but as yet the conclusion has not been drawn syllogistically:
for the premises are not in the shape we required. We are deceived in such cases because
something necessary results from what is assumed, since the syllogism also is necessary. But that
which is necessary is wider than the syllogism: for every syllogism is necessary, but not
everything which is necessary is a syllogism. Consequently, though something results when
certain propositions are assumed, we must not try to reduce it directly, but must first state the
two premises, then divide them into their terms. We must take that term as middle which is
stated in both the premises: for it is necessary that the middle should be found in both premises
in all the figures.

If then the middle term is a predicate and a subject of predication, or if it is a predicate, and
something else is denied of it, we shall have the first figure: if it both is a predicate and is denied
of something, the middle figure: if other things are predicated of it, or one is denied, the other
predicated, the last figure. For it was thus that we found the middle term placed in each figure. It
is placed similarly too if the premises are not universal: for the middle term is determined in the
same way. Clearly then, if the same term is not stated more than once in the course of an
argument, a syllogism cannot be made: for a middle term has not been taken. Since we know
what sort of thesis is established in each figure, and in which the universal, in what sort the
particular is described, clearly we must not look for all the figures, but for that which is
appropriate to the thesis in hand. If the thesis is established in more figures than one, we shall
recognize the figure by the position of the middle term.


### Chapter 33

Men are frequently deceived about syllogisms because the inference is necessary, as has been
said above; sometimes they are deceived by the similarity in the positing of the terms; and this
ought not to escape our notice. 

E.g. if A is stated of B, and B of C: it would seem that a
syllogism is possible since the terms stand thus: but nothing necessary results, nor does a
syllogism.

Let A represent the term 'being eternal', B 'Aristomenes as an object of thought', C
'Aristomenes'. It is true then that A belongs to B. For Aristomenes as an object of thought is
eternal. 

But B also belongs to C: for Aristomenes is Aristomenes as an object of thought. But A
does not belong to C: for Aristomenes is perishable. For no syllogism was made although the
terms stood thus: that required that the premise AB should be stated universally. But this is false, that every Aristomenes who is an object of thought is eternal, since Aristomenes is perishable.

Again let C stand for 'Miccalus', B for 'musical Miccalus', A for 'perishing to-morrow'. It is true to predicate B of C: for Miccalus is musical Miccalus. Also A can be predicated of B: for
musical Miccalus might perish to-morrow. But to state A of C is false at any rate. This argument
then is identical with the former; for it is not true universally that musical Miccalus perishes tomorrow: but unless this is assumed, no syllogism (as we have shown) is possible. 

This deception then arises through ignoring a small distinction. For if we accept the conclusion
as though it made no difference whether we said 'This belong to that' or 'This belongs to all of
that'.
