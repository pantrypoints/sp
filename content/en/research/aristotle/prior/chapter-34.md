### Chapter 34

Men will frequently fall into fallacies through not setting out the terms of the premise well, e.g. suppose A to be health, B disease, C man. It is true to say that A cannot belong to any B (for health belongs to no disease) and again that B belongs to every C (for every man is capable of
disease). 

It would seem to follow that health cannot belong to any man. The reason for this is that
the terms are not set out well in the statement, since if the things which are in the conditions are substituted, no syllogism can be made, e.g. if 'healthy' is substituted for 'health' and 'diseased' for 'disease'. 

For it is not true to say that being healthy cannot belong to one who is diseased.

But unless this is assumed no conclusion results, save in respect of possibility: but such a conclusion is not impossible: for it is possible that health should belong to no man. Again the fallacy may occur in a similar way in the middle figure: 'it is not possible that health should belong to any disease, but it is possible that health should belong to every man, consequently it is not possible that disease should belong to any man'. In the third figure the fallacy results in reference to possibility.

For health and disease and knowledge and ignorance, and in general contraries, may possibly belong to the same thing, but cannot belong to one another. This is not in agreement with what was said before: for we stated that when several things could belong to the same thing, they could belong to one another.

It is evident then that in all these cases the fallacy arises from the setting out of the terms: for if the things that are in the conditions are substituted, no fallacy arises. It is clear then that in such premises what possesses the condition ought always to be substituted for the condition and taken as the term.


### Chapter 35

We must not always seek to set out the terms a single word: for we shall often have complexes of
words to which a single name is not given. Hence it is difficult to reduce syllogisms with such
terms. 

Sometimes too fallacies will result from such a search, e.g. the belief that syllogism can
establish that which has no mean. Let A stand for two right angles, B for triangle, C for isosceles triangle. 

A then belongs to C because of B: but A belongs to B without the mediation of another term: for the triangle in virtue of its own nature contains two right angles, consequently there will be no middle term for the proposition AB, although it is demonstrable. For it is clear that the
middle must not always be assumed to be an individual thing, but sometimes a complex of
words, as happens in the case mentioned.


#### Chapter 36

The first term belongs to the middle, and the middle to the extreme, must not be understood
in the sense that they can always be predicated of one another or that the first term will be
predicated of the middle in the same way as the middle is predicated of the last term.

The same holds if the premises are negative. But we must suppose the verb 'to belong' to have as many meanings as the senses in which the verb 'to be' is used, and in which the assertion that a thing 'is' may be said to be true. Take for example the statement that there is a single science of contraries. 


Let A stand for 'there being a single science', and B for things which are contrary to one another.

Then A belongs to B, not in the sense that contraries are the fact of there being a single science
of them, but in the sense that it is true to say of the contraries that there is a single science of them.

Sometimes, the first term is stated of the middle, but the middle is not stated of the third term, e.g. if wisdom is knowledge, and wisdom is of the good, the conclusion is that there is knowledge of the good. The good then is not knowledge, though wisdom is knowledge.

Sometimes the middle term is stated of the third, but the first is not stated of the middle, e.g. if there is a science of everything that has a quality, or is a contrary, and the good both is a contrary and has a quality, the conclusion is that there is a science of the good, but the good is not science, nor is that which has a quality or is a contrary, though the good is both of these. 

Sometimes neither the first term is stated of the middle, nor the middle of the third, while the first is sometimes stated of the third, and sometimes not: e.g. if there is a genus of that of which there is a science, and if there is a science of the good, we conclude that there is a genus of the good. 

But nothing is predicated of anything. And if that of which there is a science is a genus, and if there is a science of the good, we conclude that the good is a genus. The first term then is predicated of the extreme, but in the premises one thing is not stated of another.

The same holds good where the relation is negative. For 'that does not belong to this' does not
always mean that 'this is not that', but sometimes that 'this is not of that' or 'for that', e.g. 'there is not a motion of a motion or a becoming of a becoming, but there is a becoming of pleasure: so pleasure is not a becoming.'

Or again it may be said that there is a sign of laughter, but there is not a sign of a sign, consequently laughter is not a sign. This holds in the other cases too, in which the thesis is refuted because the genus is asserted in a particular way, in relation to the terms of the thesis. Again take the inference 'opportunity is not the right time: for opportunity belongs to God, but the right time does not, since nothing is useful to God'. 

We must take as terms opportunity-right time-God: but the premise must be understood according to the case of the noun. 

For we state this universally without qualification, that the terms ought always to be
stated in the nominative, e.g. man, good, contraries, not in oblique cases, e.g. of man, of a good, of contraries, but the premises ought to be understood with reference to the cases of each termeither the dative, e.g. 'equal to this', or the genitive, e.g. 'double of this', or the accusative, e.g. 'that which strikes or sees this', or the nominative, e.g. 'man is an animal', or in whatever other way the word falls in the premise.
