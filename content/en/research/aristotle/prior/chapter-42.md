### Chapter 42

In the same syllogism not all conclusions are reached through one figure, but one through one figure, another through another. 

We must analyze arguments in accordance with this. 

Since not every problem is proved in every figure, but certain problems in each figure, it is clear from the conclusion in what figure the premises should be
sought.


### Chapter 43

In reference to those arguments aiming at a definition which have been directed to prove some
part of the definition, we must take as a term the point to which the argument has been directed,
not the whole definition: for so we shall be less likely to be disturbed by the length of the term:

e.g. if a man proves that water is a drinkable liquid, we must take as terms drinkable and water.


### Chapter 44

We must not try to reduce hypothetical syllogisms; for with the given premises it is not
possible to reduce them. For they have not been proved by syllogism, but assented to by
agreement. For instance if a man should suppose that unless there is one faculty of contraries,
there cannot be one science, and should then argue that not every faculty is of contraries, e.g. of what is healthy and what is sickly: for the same thing will then be at the same time healthy and sickly.

He has shown that there is not one faculty of all contraries, but he has not proved that
there is not a science. And yet one must agree. But the agreement does not come from a
syllogism, but from an hypothesis. This argument cannot be reduced: but the proof that there is
not a single faculty can. The latter argument perhaps was a syllogism: but the former was an
hypothesis.

The same holds good of arguments which are brought to a conclusion per impossibile. These
cannot be analyzed either; but the reduction to what is impossible can be analyzed since it is
proved by syllogism, though the rest of the argument cannot, because the conclusion is reached
from an hypothesis. But these differ from the previous arguments: for in the former a preliminary agreement must be reached if one is to accept the conclusion; e.g. an agreement that if there is proved to be one faculty of contraries, then contraries fall under the same science; whereas in the latter, even if no preliminary agreement has been made, men still accept the reasoning, because the falsity is patent, e.g. the falsity of what follows from the assumption that the diagonal is commensurate, viz. that then odd numbers are equal to evens.
Many other arguments are brought to a conclusion by the help of an hypothesis; these we ought
to consider and mark out clearly. We shall describe in the sequel their differences, and the
various ways in which hypothetical arguments are formed: but at present this much must be
clear, that it is not possible to resolve such arguments into the figures. And we have explained
the reason.

### Chapter 45

Whatever problems are proved in more than one figure, if they have been established in one
figure by syllogism, can be reduced to another figure, e.g. a negative syllogism in the first figure can be reduced to the second, and a syllogism in the middle figure to the first, not all however but some only.

The point will be clear in the sequel. If A belongs to no B, and B to all C, then A
belongs to no C. Thus the first figure; but if the negative statement is converted, we shall have
the middle figure.

For B belongs to no A, and to all C. Similarly if the syllogism is not universal but particular, e.g. if A belongs to no B, and B to some C. Convert the negative statement and
you will have the middle figure.

The universal syllogisms in the second figure can be reduced to the first, but only one of the two particular syllogisms. Let A belong to no B and to all C. Convert the negative statement, and you will have the first figure. 

For B will belong to no A and A to all C. But if the affirmative statement concerns B, and the negative C, C must be made first term. For C belongs to no A, and A to all B: therefore C belongs to no B. B then belongs to no C: for the negative statement is convertible.

But if the syllogism is particular, whenever the negative statement concerns the major extreme, reduction to the first figure will be possible, e.g. if A belongs to no B and to some C: convert the negative statement and you will have the first figure. For B will belong to no A and A to some C.

But when the affirmative statement concerns the major extreme, no resolution will be possible,
e.g. if A belongs to all B, but not to all C: for the statement AB does not admit of conversion, nor would there be a syllogism if it did.

Again syllogisms in the third figure cannot all be resolved into the first, though all syllogisms in the first figure can be resolved into the third. Let A belong to all B and B to some C. Since the particular affirmative is convertible, C will belong to some B: but A belonged to all B: so that the third figure is formed. 

Similarly if the syllogism is negative: for the particular affirmative is convertible: therefore A will belong to no B, and to some C. 

Of the syllogisms in the last figure one only cannot be resolved into the first, viz. when the
negative statement is not universal: all the rest can be resolved. Let A and B be affirmed of all C: then C can be converted partially with either A or B: C then belongs to some B. Consequently
we shall get the first figure, if A belongs to all C, and C to some of the Bs. If A belongs to all C and B to some C, the argument is the same: for B is convertible in reference to C. 

But if B  belongs to all C and A to some C, the first term must be B: for B belongs to all C, and C to some A, therefore B belongs to some A. But since the particular statement is convertible, A will belong to some B.

If the syllogism is negative, when the terms are universal we must take them in a similar way. Let B belong to all C, and A to no C: then C will belong to some B, and A to no C; and so C will be middle term. Similarly if the negative statement is universal, the affirmative particular: for A will belong to no C, and C to some of the Bs. But if the negative statement is particular, no resolution will be possible, e.g. if B belongs to all C, and A not belong to some C: convert the statement BC and both premises will be particular.

It is clear that in order to resolve the figures into one another the premise which concerns the
minor extreme must be converted in both the figures: for when this premise is altered, the
transition to the other figure is made.

One of the syllogisms in the middle figure can, the other cannot, be resolved into the third figure.

Whenever the universal statement is negative, resolution is possible. For if A belongs to no B
and to some C, both B and C alike are convertible in relation to A, so that B belongs to no A and
C to some A. A therefore is middle term. But when A belongs to all B, and not to some C,
resolution will not be possible: for neither of the premises is universal after conversion.
Syllogisms in the third figure can be resolved into the middle figure, whenever the negative
statement is universal, e.g. if A belongs to no C, and B to some or all C. For C then will belong
to no A and to some B. But if the negative statement is particular, no resolution will be possible: for the particular negative does not admit of conversion.

The same syllogisms cannot be resolved in these figures which could not be
resolved into the first figure, and that when syllogisms are reduced to the first figure these alone are confirmed by reduction to what is impossible.
It is clear from what we have said how we ought to reduce syllogisms, and that the figures may
be resolved into one another.
