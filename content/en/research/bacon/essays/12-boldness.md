IT IS a trivial grammar-school text, but yet worthy a wise man's consideration. 

Demosthenes was asked: What was the chief part of an orator? 

He answered, action

What next? 

action; 

What next again? 

action. 

He said it, that knew it best, and had, by nature, himself no advantage in that he commended. 

A strange thing, that that part of an orator, which is but superficial, and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed so high, above those other noble parts, of invention, elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it were all in all. 

But the reason is plain. There is in human nature generally, more of the fool than of the wise; and therefore those faculties, by which the foolish part of men's minds is taken, are most potent. Wonderful like is the case of boldness in civil business: what first? boldness; what second and third? boldness. And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts. But nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand and foot, those that are either shallow in judgment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak times. 

Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in popular states; but with senates, and princes less; and more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an ill keeper of promise. 

Surely, as there are mountebanks for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the politic body.

Men that undertake great cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two or three experiments, but want the grounds of science, and therefore cannot hold out. 

A bold fellow many times does the Prophet Mohammad's miracle. Mohammad made the people believe that he would call an hill to him, and from the top of it offer up his prayers, for the observers of his law. 

The people assembled. Mohammad called the hill to come to him, again and again. When the hill stood still, he was not abashed, but said: 

{{< q a="Mohammad" >}}
If the hill will not come to Mohammad, Mohammad will go to the hill. 
{{< /q >}}


So these men have promised great matters but have failed most shamefully. But because they have the perfection of boldness, they will but slight it over. They will make a turn with no more ado.

To men of great judgment, bold persons are a sport to behold. To the vulgar, boldness is somewhat ridiculous.

If absurdity is the subject of laughter, doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity.

Especially it is a sport to see, when a bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts his face into a most shrunken, and wooden posture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits do a little go and come; but with bold men, upon like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at chess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot stir. But this last were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation. 

This is well to be weighed; that boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger, and inconveniences. 

Therefore it is ill in counsel, good in execution; so that the right use of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be seconds, and under the direction of others. For in counsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution, not to see them, except they be very great.
