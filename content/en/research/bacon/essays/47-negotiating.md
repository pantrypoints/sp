IT IS generally better to:
- deal by speech than by letter
- deal by the mediation of a third than by a man's self. 

Letters are good, when a man would draw an answer by letter back again; or when it may serve for a man's justification afterwards to produce his own letter; or where it may be danger to be interrupted, or heard by pieces. 

To deal in person is good, when a man's face breedeth regard, as commonly with inferiors; or in tender cases, where a man's eye, upon the countenance of him with whom he speaketh, may give him a direction how far to go; and generally, where a man will reserve to himself liberty, either to disavow or to expound. 

In choice of instruments, it is better to choose men of a plainer sort, that are like to do that, that is committed to them, and to report back again faithfully the success, than those that are cunning, to contrive, out of other men's business, somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the matter in report for satisfaction's sake. 

Use also such persons as affect the business, wherein they are employed; for that quickeneth much; and such, as are fit for the matter; as bold men for expostulation, fair-spoken men for persuasion, crafty men for inquiry and observation, froward, and absurd men, for business that doth not well bear out itself. Use also such as have been lucky, and prevailed before, in things wherein you have employed them; for that breeds confidence, and they will strive to maintain their prescription. 

It is better to sound a person, with whom one deals afar off, than to fall upon the point at first; except you mean to surprise him by some short question. 

It is better dealing with men in appetite, than with those that are where they would be. If a man deal with another upon conditions, the start or first performance is all; which a man cannot reasonably demand, except either the nature of the thing be such, which must go before; or else a man can persuade the other party, that he shall still need him in some other thing; or else that he be counted the honester man. All practice is to discover, or to work. 

Men discover themselves in trust, in passion, at unawares, and of necessity, when they would have somewhat done, and cannot find an apt pretext. If you would work any man, you must either know his nature and fashions, and so lead him; or his ends, and so persuade him; or his weakness and disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have interest in him, and so govern him. 

In dealing with cunning persons, we must ever consider their ends, to interpret their speeches; and it is good to say little to them, and that which they least look for. In all negotiations of difficulty, a man may not look to sow and reap at once; but must prepare business, and so ripen it by degrees.


## Followers And Friends

COSTLY followers are not to be liked. This is because they make a man's train longer, but his wings shorter. 

They are costly not only with expenses, but also through their wearisome and importune pursuits.
<!-- I reckon to be costly, not them alone which charge the purse, but which are wearisome, and importune in suits.  -->

Ordinary followers should challenge no higher conditions, than countenance, recommendation, and protection from wrongs. 

Factious followers are worse to be liked. They follow not from affection to the person they follow, but from discontent against some other person. This creates the ill intelligence that we see between great persons. 

Likewise, glorious followers, who are the trumpets of the commendation of those they follow, are full of inconvenience. They taint business through lack of secrecy. They export honor from a man, and make him a return in envy.

There is a kind of followers likewise, which are dangerous, being indeed espials; which inquire the secrets of the house, and bear tales of them, to others. 

Yet such men, many times, are in great favor. They are officious and commonly exchange tales. 

The following by certain estates of men, answerable to that, which a great person himself professeth (as of soldiers, to him that hath been employed in the wars, and the like), hath ever been a thing civil, and well taken, even in monarchies; so it be without too much pomp or popularity. 

But the most honorable kind of following is when one is followed as a person who understands virtue and desert in all sorts of persons. 

Where there is no eminent odds in sufficiency, it is better to take with the more passable, than with the more able. 

And besides, to speak truth, in base times, active men are of more use than virtuous. 

It is true that in government, it is good to use men of one rank equally: for to countenance some extraordinarily, is to make them insolent, and the rest discontent; because they may claim a due. 

But contrariwise, in favor, to use men with much difference and election is good; for it maketh the persons preferred more thankful, and the rest more officious: because all is of favor. It is good discretion, not to make too much of any man at the first; because one cannot hold out that proportion. 

To be governed (as we call it) by one is not safe. It shows softness. It gives a freedom to scandal and disreputation.

Those who do not censure or speak ill of a man immediately will talk more boldly of those that are so great with them, and thereby wound their honor. 

Yet to be distracted with many is worse. It makes men to be of the last impression, and full of change. 

It is always honorable to take advice of some few friends. Onlookers often see more than gamesters. The vale best discovers the hill. 

There is little friendship in the world, and least of all between equals, which was wont to be magnified. 

That that is, is between superior and inferior, whose fortunes may comprehend the one the other.
