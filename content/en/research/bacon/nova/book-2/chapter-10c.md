## 8. Deviating instances

{{< s v="29" >}} Examples are the errors of nature, or strange and monstrous objects, in which nature deviates[180] and turns from her ordinary course. 

For the errors of nature differ from singular instances, inasmuch as the latter are the miracles of species, the former of individuals. 

Their use is much the same, for they rectify the understanding in opposition to habit, and reveal common forms. For with regard to these, also, we must not desist from inquiry, till we discern the cause of the deviation. The cause does not, however, in such cases rise to a regular form, but only to the latent process toward such a form. For he who is acquainted with the paths of nature, will more readily observe her deviations; and, vice versâ, he who has learned her deviations will be able more accurately to describe her paths.

They differ again from singular instances, by being much more apt for practice and the operative branch. For it would be very difficult to generate new species, but less so to vary known species, and thus produce many rare and unusual results.[122]

The passage from the miracles of nature to those of art is easy; for if nature be once seized in her variations, and the cause be manifest, it will be easy to lead her by art to such deviation as she was at first led to by chance; and not only to that but others, since deviations on the one side lead and open the way to others in every direction. 

Of this we do not require any examples, since they are so abundant. For a compilation, or particular natural history, must be made of all monsters and prodigious births of nature; of everything, in short, which is new, rare and unusual in nature.

This should be done with a rigorous selection, so as to be worthy of credit.[181] Those are most to be suspected which depend upon superstition, as the prodigies of Livy, and those perhaps, but little less, which are found in the works of writers on natural magic, or even alchemy, and the like; for such men, as it were, are the very suitors and lovers of fables; but our instances should be derived from some grave and credible history, and faithful narration.


## 9. Bordering instances or participants

{{< s v="30" >}} These:
- exhibit those species of bodies which appear to be composed of two species, or to be the rudiments between the one and the other. 
- can be classed with the singular or heteroclite instances

In the whole system of things, they are rare and extraordinary. Yet from their dignity, they must be treated of and classed separately, for they point out admirably the order and constitution of things, and suggest the causes of the number and quality of the more common species in the universe, leading the understanding from that which is, to that which is possible.

We have examples of them:
- in moss, which is something between putrescence and a plant;[123] 
- in some comets, which hold a place between stars and ignited meteors
- in flying fishes, between fishes and birds
- in bats, between birds and quadrupeds.[124] Again,

Simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis.

We have also biformed fœtus, mingled species and the like.
