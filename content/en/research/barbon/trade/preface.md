The United Provinces and the States of Venice have little land, but are great and rich. This sufficiently demonstrates the great Advantage and Profit that Trade brings to a Nation.

<!-- Since the Old Ammunition and Artillery of the Grecians and Romans are grown out of Use; such as Stones, Bows, Arrows, and battering Rams, with other Wooden Engines, which were in all Places easily procured or made:  -->

The Invention of Gunpowder introduced a new sort of Ammunition and Artillery. Its Materials are made of Minerals such as Iron, Brass, Lead, Salt-petre, and Brimstone. These are not found in all Countries

Where they are lacking, they must be procured by Traffic. 

Trade is now become as necessary to Preserve Governments, as it is useful to make them Rich.

Trade now has a great Influence in the Support and Welfare of States and Kingdoms. Yet the True Causes that raise and promote Trade are most unknown, or that Men differ most in their Sentiments about them.

Livy, and Antient Writers had elevated Genius to Inquire into the Causes of the Rise and Fall of governments. They have been very exact in describing the several Forms of Military Discipline. But they take no Notice of Trade

Machiavelli is a Modern and the best Writer. He lived in a Government where the Family of Medicis had advanced themselves to the Soveraignty by their riches, acquired by Merchandizing. 
- He does not mention Trade, as any way interested in the Affairs of State.
