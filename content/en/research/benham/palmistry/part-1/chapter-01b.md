**All that there is to destiny or fate is this matter of the seven types. **


Humanity is cast in certain moulds -- each person acts, thinks, lives, and dies in a certain way. The ancestors of this type have so lived, acted, and died, and it will do the same. 

<!-- . Unless the course of a type is changed it -->

If everyone were pure specimens of these types, then we might be fatalists. But the deeper you go into Palmistry the less will you accept an absolutely fatalistic doctrine.

In every case, one type will be predominant.

Its qualities will be the strong controlling element in the life of your client.  <!-- In his course through the world  --> The qualities of his type will largely guide and shape his destiny. 

But there is nearly always present an alloy of some other type, something that may soften the severe lines of his natural mould.

If he strongly wishes to change his course in life, he can largely modify the qualities of his type.

<!-- is fully conscious of what he wants to accomplish and has determination enough, 
 to a large degree.  -->

He can overcome them through:
- a knowledge of his shortcomings
- desire and determination

<!-- , will enable him largely to  -->

Since they all emanate from the brain, these faults, desires, and changes will all be written on the hands.

People only change their typical qualities when they have a strong desire and firm resolution to change.

Thus, we are indeed free agents, planned for a prearranged destiny. But we are always able to change it if we are determined to do so.

Thus, there is no such thing as absolute fatalism even if the 7 types tends to lead to that fatalism. 

 <!-- though we have so strong an indication in that direction from .  -->

The statement, 'The Lord helps him who helps himself' applies.

Instead of rebelling at what might seem as the Creator's cruel predestination in adopting the plan of the 7 types. But there is nothing unkind in it. 

 <!-- we can see that there is nothing unkind in the operation of this plan.  -->

<!-- on the part of our  -->

You see the Eskimos living always in the same way.
- One generation succeeds the other, lives the same way, eats the same food, reaches the same age, and dies. 
- There is nothing cruel in that.

<!-- ; you have never thought that fate was unkind to the Esquimaux.  -->

The Eskimo would laugh at you if you told him that his life is cruel. 
- He enjoys life in his way, just as well as you do in yours. 

Each of our 7 types reasons in the same fashion. 

They are best pleased with their way of living, thinking, and acting. They prefer it to your way. 

<!-- They think you odd that you do not see it as they do. You think it strange that they can be satisfied at all with their ways.  -->

Thus the world moves on, seemingly a heterogeneous mass which can be classified into 7 types of people.

These types look alike. If you know each type well, then you will know:
- what they look like
- how they reason, live, think, work, play, treat their fellows, or marry 
- their natural occupations and peculiarities

This will let you dissect him with ease, knowing him better than he knows himself.

- The Mount of Jupiter identifies the Jupiterian type
- The Mount of Saturn identifies the Saturnian
- The Mount of Apollo identifies the Apollonian
- The Mount of Mercury identifies the Mercurian
- The two Mounts of Mars identifies the Martian
  - One of whom is filled with aggression, the other full of resistance
- The Mount of Moon identifies the Lunarian
- The Mount of Venus identifies the Venusian
- The Plain of Mars is a part of the Martian type


Why do the Mounts identify these types? 

<!-- To this question the answer must be given, that at this time we have not fully solved the mystery, but there are some facts leading in that direction which will doubtless in time give us a full explanation of the matter; for we know that  -->

The human hand is the servant of the brain which executes all of the work we do. It only operates in response to the commands of the brain. 

Sever the connection between hand and brain by cutting the complex system of nerve telegraph uniting the two (as in paralysis), and the hand becomes like a lump of putty, dead and useless.

The hand is the most wonderful instrument ever created. It cannot perform one act by itself, for there is no brain or intelligence located in the hand to direct it. It follows the commands of the brain.

<!-- , the seat of mind and intelligence, which is located a considerable distance from the hand itself. This shows that  -->

The hand is entirely dependent on the brain for its intelligence. As the servant, it reflects the kind of brain behind it.

<!-- by the manner and intelligence with which it performs its duties. It is a well-accepted fact that the centre of the brain, which is in connection with the hand, has been located, and  -->

The dissections of the brain show that the different formations of this brain centre comes with differently shaped hands.  <!-- This proves that the hand physically shows what kind of a brain is directing it. If the brain centre which controls the hand is of one shape, the Mount of Jupiter will be largest, and we shall have  --> Thus, a Jupiterian brain centre creates Jupiterian thoughts, ways and peculiarities. This leads to a Jupiterian subject with a Jupiter Mount.

<!-- If this brain centre changes its form the subject develops peculiarities of character, aptitude, and disease, and we shall find other Mounts most developed, for the hand reflects all the changes of the brain, and the subject will belong to the type as shown by the best-marked Mount in the hand. 

This is unquestionably the idea from which future scientific research will gain a full explanation of the Mounts. In

The Chapter, "How to Judge Mounts and Fingers" gives minute directions for:
- classifying your subject
- knowing everything about him
- solving the secret of his creation

This is the inner secret of Palmistry.

## The Good and Bad Types

The good types are the:
- Jupiterian [navel]
- Apollonian [heart]
- Venusian [vishudda]

These have good health, happy dispositions, and do not easily become evil. 

The Saturnian and Mercurian easily cross the boundary and produce bad people. 
- They are both bilious and become warped in their views and manner of life. 

The Martian easily becomes an ardent, intense type, not necessarily bad, but often violent. 

The Lunar subject is imaginative, cold, and selfish, easily producing a restless, disagreeable person. 

Thus you have:
- 3 good types
- 2 that may be bad
- 1 violent
- 1 which may be disagreeable

<!-- This work, with the Mounts for a basis, opens a rich field for investigation.  -->

<!-- Many realize how superficial their work has been, and have longed to know why they could go only so far and no farther. This is because no other work begins on the proper foundation. -->

I have added to palmistry the other elements:
- the elementary hand (dullness)
- the square hand (regularity)
- the spatulate hand (activity and originality)
- the philosophic hand (analysis)
- the conic hand (artistic sense)
- the psychic hand (ideality)
- the mixed hand (versatility) 

These are accepted types of all other modern works. 

These formations show only a certain traits of the subject. They do not reveal him in his entirety. 

They will not tell you of his health, how he marries, loves, hates, eats, lives, dies, whether he is good, bad, cross, or cheerful. 

They do not thus open the hidden recesses of his heart, as they are revealed by the Mount types, nor can you make that subtle distinction between disease and character except through the Mount types.

<!-- The works of other recent authors start from certain qualities of the subject (regularity, activity, etc.); this work starts from the man himself, created to fill a particular place, and endowed with all the qualities necessary to enable him to do it. Is it any wonder that greater revelations should come from such a beginning? -->

The success of hand-reading is requires combination.

The type of a subject must be combined with his energy, brain power, good intentions, vices, health condition, and many other important factors, before a balance can be struck. 

<!-- Herein lies the difficulty in preparing a treatise on hand-reading.  -->

If the types are treated first, the beginner has no knowledge of the important underlying forces which must be combined with them. 

If the underlying forces are first discussed, the student is not familiar with the types. 

<!-- In the present work the leading attributes of the types are laid down in this chapter and shown in illustration "A." 

With this illustration and these attributes in mind, a sufficient knowledge of the types to begin with is obtained, and we pass to a thorough consideration of the underlying forces. 

When these have been fully mastered, we will take up a thorough discussion of the types, and will then have in our possession all the knowledge to combine with them. Thus the final chapters on the Mount types unfold the entire panorama, the difficulties in arranging the sequence of treatment of the various matters is reduced to a minimum, and put in the best form for the student's use. -->
