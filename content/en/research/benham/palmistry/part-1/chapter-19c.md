Are strong determination and reason back of Jupiterian desires and ambitions?

The supreme test is made by the thumb as it will show what kind of will is present.

 
<!-- , as shown by the shape of the will phalanx, - whether --> 

<!-- clubbed, spatulate, square, conic, paddle-shaped, broad, or refined.  -->

Then see how much will there is by the length of the will phalanx. 

See if reason and logic are strong by length of the second phalanx, see what kind of reason by the shape of this phalanx, then see if will is stronger than reason, evenly balanced with it, or deficient. 

From these examinations you can tell whether good sense and determination will make the Jupiterian ambitions succeed or whether lack of these qualities will ruin them. 

No matter what the ambitions, there must be will and reason to bring them to anything. No matter how strong the Jupiterian, he must have a good thumb to make him what he was built to be, a commander and leader. Now by discovering the type of the subject, you know what sphere in life he was created to fill. 

You can picture what the pure type looks like -- his:
- characteristics
- health difficulties and dangers
- faults and virtues

The following can be determined from the characteristics of the hand:

Characteristic | Personal Quality
--- | ---
Texture of hand | Is he refined or coarse?
Flexibility of hand | Does he have an elastic or stiff mind?
Consistency of hand | Does he have energy or laziness?
Color of hand | Is he cold, warm, bilious, or congested?
Nails | Is he nervous, robust or weak, honest, cranky, or critical? Does he have heart disease, consumption, bronchitis?
Hair | Is he full of vital energy?
Hand as a whole | Does he live in the mental, abstract, or material worlds?
Phalanges of finger | What side will his peculiar type qualities take?
Tips of finger | Is he artistic, practical, active? Will original ideas govern?
Smooth fingers | Will inspiration guide him?
Knotty fingers | Will reason and analysis rule?
Long and short fingers | Will minutiae and detail, or quick thought and action and generalities be his modes of procedure?
Thumb | Will will and reason push all these qualities towards success.

Unfortunately, we find the bad type of Jupiterian so often that these must be fully considered.


## The Bad Jupiterian

In this bad type the appearance is changed, the life, beauty, and strength diminished, and in place there is an undersized man, not commanding in appearance, eyes in which kindliness is lacking, a bad skin without the healthy glow of the good type, straight, stiff hair, a poorly shaped nose, mouth very large, full and sensual, with long, dark teeth.

This Jupiterian is forbidding and unattractive, and no crowd follows in his steps.

The bad type has all the Jupiterian love of command, but no power of enforcing it except upon those weak and unable to resist him. He is the tyrant and despot at heart, but frequently finds only his family upon whom to exercise these qualities. Thus in his home he is a person of overbearing pettiness. 

He is grossly extravagant, but in spending his money he furthers only his own pleasure and gratifies only his own appetite. He is a sensualist, selfish in the extreme, and a debauchee. His family are subjected to indignities and forced to submit to a tyrannical will. 


<!-- The Mount Of Jupiter. Part 6 -->

With no one to rule but these helpless victims whom he should cherish, he forces them to feel his rough Jupiterian despotism and sensualism, producing misery and unhappiness for them. 

He is unsuccessful in life and miserable, for desire to rule is always thwarted, and realizing this ill-success, he turns to debauchery and makes life a burden to himself and to his family. 

Weak as he is, mean as he is, the Jupiterian desire for power and rule is in him, but instead of making him successful in the world he is only a producer of woe. 

The bad type is shown by a full red Mount of Jupiter, deep red lines, a very crooked finger of Jupiter, excessively thick in the third phalanx, coarse skin, a stiff hand, short nails, large thumb with thick will phalanx, and short thick second phalanx. 

The best hand for a good Jupiterian is large with smooth fingers and square tips, broad, pink nails, square or rounding on the end, the finger of Jupiter conic and large, with the phalanges equally developed, a good Mount of Venus and Mercury, elastic consistency, normal flexibility, a large thumb with long, broad, or paddle-shaped will phalanx, and long waist-like second phalanx.



Nearly all Jupiterian hands will be thick in the third phalanges, and have deep Head and Life lines, with color very pink or red. 

Follow the directions of Chapter 18 Mounts And Fingers in locating the Mounts to find the predominating Mount and the second Mount. 

If the Mount of Jupiter is strongest and Venus next, he will be a Jupiterian-Venusian.
- All the Jupiterian ambition, desires, and qualities will be present, as well as love, sympathy, and the long train of Venusian attributes. 

Always consider the qualities of the leading type as predominant, to which add those of the secondary Mounts. 

Note in the secondary Mounts, by the phalanges of the finger, which world rules, as either the mental strength, business qualities, or the baser elements of the secondary type will be the ones which will support the leading type. 

Thus with a Jupiterian-Mercurian, the finger of Mercury having the second phalanx longest, the Jupiterian, which is the leading type, will be supported and helped by the scientific qualities of the Mercurian, this being the indication of the second phalanx of Mercury.

If the first phalanx of Mercury, in the above combination, is the longest instead of the second, it will be the Mercurian powers of oratory and eloquence that will help the Jupiterian. 

This is a great assistance to one who wishes to influence others.

By locating the leading and the attendant Mounts, and by noting which phalanx of the fingers lead, there is no hand to be found in which you cannot distinguish the leading type, the attendant types, and determine also what quality of the leading one is predominant, as well as what side of the attendant Mounts will help forward the combination. 

This is the way to decide upon occupations. It is absolutely accurate in determining what is the best vocation in life for a client. 

The Jupiterian seldom commits suicide. When he does it is the result of disappointed ambition or wounded vanity.

When he gets discouraged to the point of committing suicide, the Jupiterian instead takes to drink and drowns his sorrows in the "flowing bowl."
- Jupiterians who commit suicide have short fingers and act upon impulse. 
- Thus in a sudden disappointment they may on the spur of the moment jump from a high place or use a revolver.
- Long-fingered or knotty-fingered Jupiterians do not take their own lives.

Give a Jupiterian time to think it out and he will never do so.

The drink habit is a danger which all Jupiterians have to encounter, and this is especially a danger if the color of the hands, lines, and nails be red. 

These high-spirited subjects find a great temptation to indulge their appetite for stimulants. If the Life line shows great vigor of constitution by its depth and color this is a positive menace to a Jupiterian.
