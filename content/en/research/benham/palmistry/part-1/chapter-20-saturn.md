The Saturnian is identified by the Mount and finger of Saturn.

He is more pronounced if:
- his Mount of Saturn is developed
- his finger is the larger and longer
- the tip of this finger is squarer

A highly developed Mount of Saturn is rare. Most people just have a depression instead.

A long finger of Saturn is quite common.
- It shows the presence of some Saturnian qualities

The Mount, though it may not be prominent, often shows, by the lines upon it, that it is of more than ordinary development. 

Great care must be used with this Mount, as it shows strong characteristics.



The following increase the strength of the Mount of Saturn as single signs or in combination:
- triangle
- circle
- trident
- single vertical line
- square 

Its defects, either of health or character, are indicated by:
- cross-bar
- grille
- cross
- island

A person is easily Saturnian if his Saturn Mount is the central peak which the other Mounts lean towards. 

<!-- Most Saturnians will be known from the fact that the apex of the Mount of Saturn is central, and the peaks of the other Mounts all lean toward it.  -->

This is more obvious if the finger of Saturn stands upright, with the other fingers drawn toward it.

<!-- A more pronounced identification of the type, and also a very common one, is to find  -->

I have chosen such an illustration to accompany this chapter because it is quite typical and much more common than the high Mount.

It is a blessing that the world is not peopled entirely with Saturnians. Otherwise, it would be "a vale of tears."

The finger of Saturn is the balance-wheel to the character.
- It accurately indicates a person's power to hold undue enthusiasm in check.

The brighter types which add gayety to the world are the:
- Jupiterian
- Apollonian
- Martian
- Venusian

The Saturnian type keeps them from going too fast and from being carried away by their excessive spirit.
