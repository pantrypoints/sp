The Mercurian is identified by the Mount and Finger of Mercury. 

He is always pronounced in his characteristics, and has great power as an orator, a scientist, a physician, or a lawyer, and is also very successful in business. 

The first aim, with every subject of this type, should be to discover:
- which of his several phases is strongest, and
- whether the good or bad side is dominant

Of all the types, the Mercurian gives way to dishonesty most easily. 
- It is one of the best and most successful of all of the types. 
- But the bad Mercurians are the greatest liars, swindlers, or cheats.

This is why this type requires careful consideration. This type has more different elements than in any of the others. 

The Mercurian is generally successful:
- primarily because:
  - of his shrewdness
  - he is a wonderful judge of human nature
- secondarily because of skill with his hands and his tireless energy.

In the professions of law and medicine he is in his element, since, in the former especially, natural shrewdness and facility of expression help him greatly. 

The Mercurians are fine writers and shrewd business men, achieving the greatest success in both lines. As single signs, or in combination, the star, triangle; circle, single vertical line, trident or square strengthen a Mount of Mercury. 

The cross-bar, grille, cross, island or dot, show defects of the Mount, either of health or character, nails, color, etc., will determine which (105). When the Mount of Mercury is well developed, finger long and large, and apex of the Mount centrally located, you have a Mercurian subject (106). 

In stature the Mercurian is small, averaging about five feet six inches, compactly built, trim in appearance, tidy looking and with a strong, forceful expression of countenance. His face is oval in shape, features inclined to be regular, and the expression changes rapidly, showing the quick play of his mind. The skin is smooth, fine, and transparent, tending to be olive in color, and shows the passing of the blood current underneath, by easily turning alternately red or white when excited, embarrassed, or in fear. 

The forehead is high and bulging, the hair is chestnut or black and inclined to be curly on the ends. The Mercurian grows a beard easily, which covers the face well, and is generally a little darker than the hair, if it be any color other than black. He likes to wear his beard trimmed closely and running to a point on the chin, Vandyke fashion. The eyebrows are not thick but are regular in outline, running to fine points at the ends, and sometimes meeting over the nose.

The latter growth is rare, however, belonging more distinctively to the Saturnian. The eyes are dark or quite black, restless and sharp in expression. They look right at and seemingly through you, and sometimes produce the disagree-able but correct conviction that you are being estimated by one well able to do it.

The nose is thin and straight, somewhat fleshy on the end; the lips are thin, evenly set and often a trifle pale or bluish in color. The whites of the eye frequently have a trace of yellow, as the Mercurian is of a nervous and slightly bilious type. His nervousness makes him breathe quickly and often through his mouth. The chin is long and sharp, sometimes turning up slightly at the end, completing the oval contour of his face. The neck is strong and muscular, connecting the head with shapely shoulders, lithe and sinewy and graceful in outline. 

The chest is large for the stature, well muscled and containing big lungs. The voice of the Mercurian is not full and loud, nor weak and thin, but is of medium timbre and possesses good "carrying" quality. 

The limbs are graceful, giving him agility and the quickness of movement for which he is noted, as well as a power of endurance coming from muscular strength. His teeth are white, small in size, and set evenly in the gums which are medium pink in color. Altogether the Mercurian impresses you as well knit, agile, and strong, not always beautiful, but shapely and well proportioned. 


The Mercurian is the quickest and most active of all the types, and this activity is not confined to his physical agility but applies to the mental as well. He is like a flash in his intuitive faculty, and enjoys everything which puts his quickness to either a mental or physical test. He is the personification of grace in his movements and is skilful in everything he undertakes. 

 

He is proficient in all games. He plays with his head and his hands. He wins because he plans his plays, and shrewdly estimates the ability of his opponent.

He wins in all athletic sports where dexterity and skill, instead of brute strength, are needed. 

In argument he is at home, for no one has greater facility of expression than he. 

This, added to the quickness with which he can grasp and turn an opportunity to his account, brings him out ahead, if his side of the question has even a semblance of probability. He is especially fond of oratory, and eloquence in any line strongly moves him. 

With his keenness and the power of expressing himself well, he is very tactful and adroit, thus making many friends by saying the right thing at the right time. As an after-dinner speaker he is a success, and in a battle of words or badinage is an opponent hard to overcome. 

One of the chief elements of the Mercurian's success, is his ability to judge human nature and character. He mentally estimates everyone whom he meets, and uses his quick mind and tactful way to make a friend and accomplish what he wishes. He is adroit, crafty, and a constant schemer, using all his powers of shrewdness, intuition, and oratory to get himself through the world. 

He is a dangerous person, you say. Verily he is, for not one of all the other types is for a moment his equal in diplomacy, craftiness, tact, persuasiveness shrewdness, or adroit methods of approach. This power makes him influential and if he is bad, much to be feared. He is a clever manager and well knows how to keep in the background and push forward some puppet to do his bidding. His power over men comes largely from the shrewdness with which he lays his plans, and the clever way in which he gets someone else to carry them out if necessary. 

He understands humanity thoroughly, and uses this knowledge to his own advantage. He is not lazy; one of his prime elements is industry, consequently he loses no opportunities through napping but turns every hour to account. 

<!-- ## Part 2 -->

He has a love for study, especially scientific investigation. 

He is a born mathematician. No problem is so intricate that he cannot solve it. 

He is, of all the types, the most successful as a physician. 

The rank of men who have succeeded with a lucrative practice are:
1. Mercurian 
2. Jupiterian

There-verse is also a good combination, provided the Mercurian qualities are very strong. 

Numerous small vertical lines on the Mount of Mercury, with the Mercury finger longer than normal, or with the second phalanx long, will be a strong indication of talent for medical studies. This marking is to be found on the hands of prominent and successful doctors - It is called the "Medical Stigmata" (107). 

On the hand of a woman it shows great ability as a nurse. 

Energy, studiousness, scientific aptitude, combined with keenness in judging human nature, make the Mercurian an excellent diagnostician and practitioner. He is also talented as an occult scientist, being able, with his shrewdness and keenness of perception, to master all the intricacies of the intangible sciences. 

Thus, the Mercurian is well adapted to these occult studies, but, as he is fond of money-making, and bad Mercurians are conscienceless, we find the humbug clairvoyants and fortune-tellers all belonging to this type. 

Having met a number of alleged palmists who claim to tell your name from the hand, and the names of friends, I have found them all specimens of the bad Mercurian type, and they have often admitted to me that they knew little about Palmistry, but resorted to sleight-of- hand tricks, together with their ability to judge human nature, in order to fool the public and get money from them. 

These bad Mercurians, and the superficial knowledge of amateur palmists are responsible for the disfavor which in the minds of some people rests to-day on Palmistry. 

The Mercurian loves things close to nature. He admires horses, dogs, pictures of real life, natural scenery, or portraits. 

He is fond of reading, but it is not romance that attracts him so much as books which are true to life, nature, and humanity. 

Dickens and Kipling are favorites with Mercurians.
