<!-- Part 3  -->

The Lunarian with a flabby, spongy hand and muscular development shows extreme laziness, preferring to live in cloudland.<!--  rather than to dwell in an abode upon earth.  -->
- He is constantly a prey to his imaginings, thinks he is ill, and has divers ailments, is fickle, restless, and changeable. 
- It is hard for him to settle down to humdrum life, for he is always yearning for things beyond his reach. 
- Therefore he is never satisfied long in one place, but desires a constant change of location and scene.

This restless disposition leads him to spend his last dollar for travel, and often the Lunarian becomes a great traveller. 

The more lines there are on the Mount the more restless he becomes and the greater is his desire to go from place to place. 

So while the lines on the Mount of the Moon do not per se especially indicate journeys, they do strengthen the Lunar qualities of the subject, and this Lunar restlessness makes him a traveller if he has money to gratify this desire.

If the hand is firm and the wealth equal to it, you may be sure that a subject with these lines will gratify his love of travel by taking long voyages. 

If the circumstances do not permit the subject to gratify his love for change you will find that these lines produce in him a yearning for travel. 

The Lunarian, by his physical construction, has white color and white coldness of temperament. To him "self" is a great word. 

He is lazy physically and lazy mentally. He loves to dream dreams, and work, which means either mental or physical exertion, is extremely distasteful to him.

He is dreamy in look, his eyes have an uncanny expression, and their light blue or gray color speaks of coldness and dreaminess. 

Thus he becomes mystical, often melancholy, and grows superstitious. 

He believes in signs and omens, and has wonderful visions and hallucinations which grow to be real to him and influence him greatly. 

He is slow in his movements, phlegmatic in disposition, and extremely sensitive. He imagines slights when none are intended, and shrinks into himself and away from company.

He does not love nor seek society. He realizes that he is different from other people, so retires to the woods or secluded places where he can enjoy himself by himself. He loves nature, birds, flowers, and all things which elevate the senses and excite the imagination, and to such surroundings he goes when out of touch with the world and its inhabitants. 

He is fond of poetry, but it is the epic kind or verses which bring to mind a chain of new material to dream about. He loves music, but of the deep classic kind, not the gay, sparkling melody that attracts the Venusian. He is a composer, and in seclusion and retirement produces profound classics.

The Lunarian is very fond of water. He loves the murmur of the waves and the roar and thunder of the tempest. As far as he is able he lives near water, and is on it as much as possible. The Lunarian makes a good sailor. He is never generous; to him selfishness is innate. He is a big eater, though not sensual nor amorous. 

In his case the sexual appetites are excited by imagination, and not by physical heat. The Lunarian is lacking in self-confidence, and feels his unfitness for the active pursuits of life. He also lacks energy and perseverance, consequently is unsuccessful in the business world. 

If he is of a common type he has a hard time to get along. If of a high type he becomes a good writer of romance or fiction, and even of history. This type will be much assisted if he has a long finger of Mercury with the first phalanx long. 

With this latter combination, conic tips will add to the imaginative tendencies of his writings; they will become more practical if the tips are square, and active and original if spatulate. 

Thus we see in the Lunarian a peculiar subject, in whom imagination and fancy are always the dominating motives. It is a blessing that the pure type is not more common, but it is necessary to have some of the imagination common to it.

If all the people in the world were pure Lunarians it would not be long before there would not be insane asylums enough to hold them. 

But the possession of a healthy imagination is the farthest possible step from insanity, and the development of the Mount must be very bad and very strong before you begin to think of attributing such an outcome to your subject. 

Imagination must mean a good quality until it is spoiled by being found in excess.

The Lunarian, while not as strongly impelled toward matrimony as some of the other types, still does not avoid it entirely. 

He is cold by nature and incapable of strong affection. He has not great physical strength, so the fires of passion do not inflame him. He is as fickle and capricious here as everywhere else, and makes strange alliances. 

Sometimes he marries one much older than himself, sometimes one a great deal younger - you cannot tell much about what he will do except that he will make a peculiar match. 

These subjects have not the faculty of being constant, and as they are naturally fickle, restless, and selfish they make poor husbands or wives; this is pronounced with conic or pointed tips, less a fact with square or spatulate. No type appears in greater abundance among those having marital unhappiness than the Lunarian. 

The health difficulties of the type are many, for he has poor circulation, thin blood, white color, and spongy muscles, and therefore readily falls a prey to disease. 

Note in the description of the type that he has a paunchy abdomen, which in all pure specimens is largely distended. This shows that the same flabby condition is present in the intestines as with the muscles, and this condition, which may properly be called a weakening of these tissues, makes them a fertile place for bacilli to propagate, and we find the Lunarian a victim of peritonitis, inflammation of the bowels, appendicitis, and all other inflammations that are liable to attack the intestinal tract. 

In epidemics of Asiatic cholera, Lunarians are the first victims, as the bacilli which produce cholera propagate readily under such conditions as they present. 

<!-- Part 4  -->

This liability to intestinal disorder is shown on the upper third of the Mount by cross-bars, grilles, badly formed stars, dots, islands, crosses, or similar defective markings. 

When such are seen on this part of the Mount, bowel delicacy exists, and the Life line should be at once examined to determine how serious it is. If the Life line is broken, crossed, islanded, has a star on it, forks, or any of the innumerable defects peculiar to it, feel safe in saying that the subject has bowel difficulties of a serious nature.

The Lunarian is also predisposed to gout and rheumatism. 

These are shown by the defects, such as crosses, grilles, etc., mentioned above, appearing on the middle third of the Mount. Other indications often confirm this; for instance, you will sometimes see a line running from the Mount of Saturn to the line of Life, either cutting it or stopping on it. 

This line has in addition frequently an island (124). I follow the practice with this indication of always looking for health defects of Saturn, one of which is rheumatism. 

I have many times seen a line running from the middle portion of the Mount of the Moon, another seat of rheumatism, and joining the line from Saturn either where it cuts the line of Life or somewhere in its course (124). 

This has shown invariably that the subject is either at the time a victim to severe rheumatism, has had it, or will have it, for when this double marking is seen, the rheumatic tendency is hereditary. The lower third of the Mount with defective markings found will indicate kidney and bladder trouble in men, and on a woman's hand, in addition, very pronounced female weakness (see Chittenden Hotel suicide). 

If you find the defective markings on this portion of the Mount, and the hand and nails very white, swollen and flabby in consistency, it will indicate kidney and bladder difficulty as well as tendency to dropsy. This dropsy will attack the feet and legs of this type, which are already swollen in appearance. 

Kidney trouble is most often shown by cross-bars on the Mount of Luna. 

Often a line from such a bad marking on the Mount will be found running to the Life line, which will be forked or defective in some way, and this will show that these diseases threaten the life of the subject. Female trouble is also shown by this lower third of the Mount when defectively marked. When female weakness is present, there is often a star on the line of Mercury, usually near the line of Head or at a point where the Mercury line crosses the line of Head (125). 

When this star is seen, it is an unmistakable indication of serious female weakness. This I have verified hundreds of times. 

Remembering that these organs make possible the reproduction of the species, and that their diseased condition makes maternity either impossible or hazardous, the importance of this indication is very great, for it may tell why women seemingly healthy never have had children. It is also valuable as a pre-marriage indication, tending to show whether a union is likely to be fruitful. 

This is the place on the hand you must examine if consulted as to why no children have blessed a woman a question that is often eagerly asked. You can thus readily detect proof of diseased conditions of the reproductive organs, and the subject cannot have children while they are in such a state. 

Subjects so afflicted are frequently unaware of trouble of this character, consequently do not consult a physician and get the relief which is possible to them. 

This is one instance where a good practice of Palmistic knowledge can transform a barren, joyless home into one of fruition and happiness. These health indications shown by the three sections of the Mount of the Moon are so often encountered and so reliable that I commend them to most careful attention. 

It does not follow that when these markings and health defects are seen the subject is a Lunarian, but it does show that he has a health defect peculiar to this type. Which one it is will be indicated by whatever portion of the Mount shows the defective markings =  bowel trouble, upper third; gout and rheumatism, middle third; kidney, bladder, and female trouble, lower third.

The bad Lunarian <!-- is found, as are all the other types, with his bad side developed.  -->:
- is shorter in stature
- has hair stiff and brittle
- has skin dead white and spotted
- has eyes watery and gray
- has the pores of the skin exuding disagreeable perspiration. 
- is talkative
- is apt to be untruthful
- often allows the imagination to run rampant
- thus he deceives not only others but himself as well. 
- is mean and selfish, cowardly
- has no physical passion
- constantly seeks amorous pleasures in order to gratify their imagination. 

Examples are nymphomaniacs. They are:
- deceitful
- hypocritical
- tend to slander everyone who incurs their displeasure
- insolent
- unchaste
- most disagreeable creatures
- shunned and abhorred by mankind. 


## Insanity 

Excessive luna development and consequent liability produces insanity. 

If it is very large, both bulging at the percussion and thick in the palm, having strong vertical lines, or with a well-marked star, it is a Mount liable to lead to the excess of imagination, and, consequently, insanity. 

This may be a mild species of hallucination if the hand is fine and the indications not pronounced, or it may be dangerous and brutal mania with a coarse brutal type of Lunarian.

Excess of the Mount will make excess of the imagination, which, per se, means an unbalanced condition of mind; so with every excessive Mount look for this unhinging of the mental faculties commonly called insanity, whose presence is indicated in several ways, the excessive Mount of the Moon being one of them.

In seeking the cause which has produced insanity in any subject, that arising from the excess of the Mount of the Moon shows it has not been shock or disease, but that it is excessive imagination inherent in the subject. This form of mania is difficult to treat, for the nature of the subject, which is inherently crazy, cannot be changed.
