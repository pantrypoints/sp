## Women

Female troubles create a disturbance of the mind. 

They grow gloomy and despondent when their trouble is intense, and especially during their monthly periods. 

<!-- Part 5  -->

During some such periods, the mind of an otherwise strong and healthy subject becomes temporarily clouded. She imagines all sorts of things, frequently that her husband is growing less affectionate, and kindred ideas.

During all such periods, these subjects should have the greatest care and kindness. They should not be annoyed. 

Many suicides show palms with this lower third of the Mount of the Moon showing female weakness. They were temporarily unbalanced when they committed suicide (see Chittenden Hotel suicide). 

In the insane asylums, there are many cases from this cause, all showing this marking. 

<!-- It is natural that the Lunarian type will be much influenced by various qualities indicated by the several parts of the hand.  -->


## Texture

Texture of the skin will bring to bear refiniug or coarsening influences. 

If the texture is soft and fine, it will be found with flabby consistency, consequently while the imaginings will be on a high plane of refinement these subjects will be lazy and accomplish little. 

Their ideals will be high, tastes refined, the dreams that come to them will be of beautiful and refined things. Coarseness will be abhorrent and aestheti-cism extreme. Oscar Wilde is an example of this class. The medium texture is best with a well-developed Lunar Mount, for it will speak of more energy and more practical ideas. 

This is the subject who will not be bound down by materialism, but who has a reasonable play of the mind. 

Coarse texture will mean an accompaniment of the hard consistency. This subject will have an inelastic mind, coarse and unrefined ideas, low ideals, with superstition extremely marked, or intense mysticism, and often the bad development of the type is accompanied by this coarse texture of skin. The less the intelligence and the coarser the nature, the more superstitious is a subject. 

Consistency will tell how much the natural Lunar laziness is increased or how much energy from some of the other types has been infused. 

Flabby consistency is expected in a pure type, and accentuates all the qualities of the type:
- idealism
- fancy
- dreaminess
- laziness.

Such subjects are idle dreamers, and the world seldom knows that they have lived. 

Elastic consistency shows that intelligent energy will put to some use the ideas of the mind, and the subject will be clever, not bound down by rule, versatile, ingenious, a good talker, and will have original ideas, for healthy imagination produces these things.

In addition, he will not sit idly and make nothing of his ideas, but will work, for he has energy. If a business man, the subject will devise new schemes to push his business. If a writer, he will be happy in bis efforts, for he will have both the mind to produce and energy to do the work. Some of the best authors belong to this class. As a musician and composer he will have the natural ability for his work and the energy to do it. Hard consistency is abnormal. It will give great activity and will make the subject restless, superstitious, selfish, and mystical. 


These people are not contented with their lot in life, but are growlers and trouble breeders. Their imagination is active but not directed toward elevated matters, and, being constantly dissatisfied themselves, they create dissatisfaction among others. The hard-handed Lunarian has distorted views on religion and all matters of life. He is often uneducated, though he assumes to talk like a professor, but reaches after an idea which he never succeeds in expressing. 

He is superstitious, and often seeks all of the lower manifestations of Spiritism which appeal to his love of the supernatural. These subjects are the greatest travellers, always discontented, out of tune with the world, and seeking change or excitement. Flexibility shows the elastic mind, and consequently adds to the Lunarian imagination. If marked, the subject will be flighty, will be extreme in views and moods, one moment exalted, the next depressed. These people are brilliant, for with the flexible mind added to imagination they could not be otherwise, but they hate effort and do not make much of their talent. 

They are good conversationalists, and versatile mentally. Normal flexibility will reduce the danger of extremes. The mind will not so readily become a prey to imagination, but will be held in check and directed into practical channels. There will be no lessening of the ability to form mental pictures, but there will be less tendency to be dominated by them. 

Thus medium flexibility is best for a Lunarian to possess. The stiff hand will indicate lack of intelligence in the subject. He will have the lower qualities of the type, will be miserly, will lack sympathy, and his imagination will satisfy itself in hunting mysterious manifestations rather than in developing any product of a highly original mind. He will shudder when the door creaks, will be terrified when a dog howls, and being cold, selfish, and fanciful, is a hard subject with whom to deal. 

The color of the hands claims attention with this type. White is the color typical of the strong Lunarian. It will aid greatly in judging the degree of type. 

If very pronounced, the coldness of the type will be strongly marked, and health defects must be carefully studied. If the hand is pink, it will show that the type is warmed up, and the heart is stronger, the blood richer and is reaching the skin in good supply. With this condition there will be less mysticism, less idealism, more practical ideas, more warmth of nature, less selfishness, and less restlessness. The subject will be even tempered, less fickle, and less liable to health defects of the type. 

Red color will show a great increase of these improvements. Ardor and warmth will be marked, and often, when you cannot understand why a Lunar subject shows so little coldness, it will be found that the hand, lines, and nails are quite red. This warms him up in every way, and makes health troubles of the lower third less likely, but renders him more liable to the bowel inflammations of the upper third. It also makes him amorous and easily excited by anything that is suggestive or appeals to his imagination. Yellow color will add a disagreeable indication, for it will make him cross and ugly.
