<!-- The Mount Of The Moon. Part 6  -->

These qualities added to coldness and selfishness, which are always present with yellow color, form a combination that leads the subject easily to become bad and vicious. He has distorted (yellow) views of life, people, and things, and, with a brain affected by poisoned blood, and being already highly imaginative, he sees everything from a bad standpoint, and easily becomes insane. 

With yellow color we find gouty and rheumatic troubles pre-liable, as shown on the middle third of the Mount. These must be looked after, for they will greatly influence the life of a subject. 

Blue color is often found, for with poor blood sluggishly pumped we find indications of a weak heart and consequent blue color. This is often an accompaniment of the diseases of the lower third of the Mount, and especially with women. 

When found, the age must be carefully noted, in order to tell whether the disturbance is permanent, or incidental to puberty, or change of life. The nails must be considered, for if we find a broad nail indicating strong general health, it will show that the subject is less liable to health defects and has a better temperament. This broad nail, if of good texture and pink, will add to the subject's chances, for with good general health, lack of nervous excitement, and normal circulation, the temper, mind, and disposition will all improve. If the nail is narrow, it will show delicate constitution, and the Mount must be carefully examined for health indications. Color must be carefully noted under the nails, for here we see a reflection of the white, pink, red, yellow, or blue disturbances of health and temperament. The texture of the nail must be considered. 

A badly crossed Mount with fluted or brittle nails shows a highly sensitive, discontented, irritable, nervous person. Such an one will be a victim to many hallucinations. Heart-disease nails will be a bad indication, for they will add organic disturbance to a subject already predisposed to heart trouble, which is almost always complicated with kidney trouble. Short, critical nails will make a pronounced subject pugnacious and more irritable, constantly criticising and fault-finding.

Black hair on the hands will strengthen the subject and tend to show that there is sufficient iron in the blood and system to largely counteract the flabby condition of the tissues. It will add fire, vigor, and force to the character. This subject is liable to be capricious, not always trustworthy, and generally given to stretching the truth, as Oriental instability is added to vivid imagination. Blond hair will make these subjects more phlegmatic, less volatile, and less strong. It will make them slower, but more trustworthy and less likely to indulge in falsehood.

They are not so easily carried off their feet by excessive imagination, and are consequently more practical, having a tinge of Teutonic-Saxon quality to restrain them. The hand as a whole, when taken in connection with the Mount, will indicate which of the three worlds will rule. With excess in the fingers the mental will dominate, and the imaginative faculties will be devoted to language, for which these subjects have great aptness, easily becoming expert linguists, or it will expend itself in scientific or literary studies. This subject would make a good college professor. If the middle portion of the hand is well developed, business qualities will be present. This subject will, if a writer, professor, or business man, bring good business ideas to his assistance. 

With this combination he may become celebrated and rich at the same time. If the lower portion of the hand is largest we have the dominion of the baser world. The imaginings will be low, not elevating. If the appetites are base, this low imagination will make suggestive what to other minds would convey no such meaning. The Mount itself must be subdivided into three sections and the same general rules applied as to the fingers and their individual phalanges. If the upper part of the Mount is developed most fully, all of the imaginings will be of a high order, and the same rules will apply as with the hand as a whole. 

From this formation we get linguists, professors of language, literature, and music of a classic kind, and authors. With the upper and middle third both developed, these subjects will make money through their efforts, for the mental and business worlds are joined. When the upper two worlds are deficient and the lower is like a knob on the base of the hand it shows the domination of the lower side of the type, and the thoughts and imaginings are all low. With this development of the lower third of the Mount, together with a deficient Mount of Venus which is grilled, a double or triple Girdle of Venus, a chained white Heart line, and an oozy palm, you have those who practise secret vices (126), bringing on nervous disorders, the mildest form of which is hysteria.

The finger-tips must be applied to whichever world of the Mount is in the lead. Pointed tips make the subject a prey to great idealism, religious exaltation, and he is utterly unpractical. Superstition, mysticism, and etherialism will make the life of this subject miserable and useless. He yearns continually for the impossible and unrealizable. Conic tips are normal to the type, and add their intuitive qualities, tinging the subject with romance and fancy. 

These subjects hate to work and belong to the lazy class. 

Square tips make the subject more practical. They pull down the idealism to a common-sense plane, make the subject more regular in habit and thought, and we get the best results of the type. Historians, composers, musicians who regard all the rules of metre and rhythm, are found with such combinations. Here we find a healthy imagination, which, coupled with practical ideas and common-sense, produces successful Lunarians. Spatulate tips add activity to an already restless person, especially if the Mount is grilled and cross-lined. They are original in ideas, entirely unconventional, and their danger is that they may constantly chase some will-o'-the-wisp of the fancy, until they become rovers.

<!-- Part 7  -->

If they have a smooth Mount, good Head line, and some square formation of the sides of the fingers, they become brilliant essayists, deep students or musicians, in which lines they excel as executionists. Knotty fingers reduce the fanciful condition to a marked degree, as they make a subject reason. They are in fact one of the greatest reducing factors for a Lunarian, and these subjects produce practical writers, teachers, and deep thinkers. 

They can throw over the most abstruse question a shimmer of imagination which makes it interesting, and wherever they are, or whatever the subject of their efforts, good reasons are given for everything they say, while at the same time they are not tied down to the earth by severe materialism. Smooth fingers, with their impulse and intuition, their artistic sense and distaste for analysis, form an accompaniment which brings out the Lunarian qualities strongly. In this case imagination is heightened, usefulness becomes subservient to beauty, and the result is a highly artistic nature full of poetic ideals. These subjects love romance, poetry, and fiction, and, if writers, they produce such works. They love art, painting, and sculpture that is the product of some artist's imagination. 

They are quick in forming opinions, not always practical, and add the artistic intuitive qualities of smooth fingers to the imaginative ideals of the Lunarian. Such subjects are likely to be continually changing in their ideas and occupations, winding up their lives without having put their naturally brilliant qualifications to good account.

Long fingers add minutiae and detail to the Lunarian qualities. Such subjects when describing some creation of their fancy will not omit an iota that can make the picture complete. These long fingers with this naturally slow type add to the slowness; and to the selfishness belonging to the type, the distrust and suspicion of long fingers. The subject is apt to be orderly in dress and surroundings, and extremely likely to be sensitive and ready to take offense at trifles. If writers, they are prone to sacrifice strength to detail, and as teachers will prolong their dissertations to unwise lengths. 

As painters, they can create an imaginative scene, and not omit a detail in their treatment of the subject. In conversation they are fanciful and tiresome. Short fingers make the subject quick, impulsive, and likely to "fly off the handle." They also make him slovenly in appearance, careless about everything he does, and apt to rely entirely on inspiration. These subjects plan the greatest schemes, which are usually entirely unpractical. They are continually in danger of making mistakes from going too fast and attempting too much, and they are the persons who always have a new idea which is "sure to be successful," and this leads them into continually fooling themselves. The thumb will either calm the subject or make him more visionary. 

A large thumb will show strong will and reason, which materially strengthen the subject. A short thumb reduces both will and reason and makes him visionary, vacillating, and weak. This is especially true if the thumb be pointed. Remember that a square, spatulate, or paddle-shaped short thumb is more stable and strengthening than a pointed or conic short thumb, and that pointed or conic tips will reduce the strength of a large thumb. Examine the individual phalanges of the thumb to see if will is in excess of reason, or vice versa, then apply your information to the Lunar qualities. See if a thick, coarse thumb is to brutalize the imagination, or whether a delicate, refined thumb will make the ideals high. 

Then note the Head line. If it goes straight across the hand it makes the ideas more practical; if it droops to the Mount of the Moon it tinges them with imagination. If it is clear, well marked, and of good color, you have a strong mind, self-control, and healthy imagination. This gives all the benefits of the type without its dangers. 

If the Head line is broken, wavy, islanded, chained, poorly marked, or badly colored, containing perhaps in its course a star, you must ascribe poor faculty of mental concentration, lack of firmness, a weakened brain, and vivid imagination; and from such subjects come those who are continually changing their mind, are restless, never satisfied, and vacillating, and, if actual insanity is escaped, are continually verging on an unbalanced condition of mind. 

Thus the Lunarian ranges from a highly gifted subject to one who is insane, all indicated by the size, character, and markings of the Mount. 

Wherever no Mount is found, you find dense materialism. 

When you find too much Mount, there is too much imagination, which may mean insanity. 

So, again, we seek to find the happy medium which will show the healthy operation of the mind. Do not expect to find many typical Lunarians, but do expect to find with nearly every subject, imagination in some degree developed. 

You need have no trouble whatever in grading its extent, the plane on which it operates, nor the combinations that accompany it if you have thoughtfully digested this chapter and what precedes it.
