With nearly every break in the heart line, one end of the broken line will go wide of its course and will show what has influenced the line sufficiently to break it. 

Breaks are always serious even though small. When wide or when the ends of the broken line are far apart and unrepaired, they become serious enough to warrant the reading of probable fatality. 

When breaks of any size are seen look for repair signs. 

If the ends of the line lap, or have sister lines joining them, squares surrounding, or anything which will help retain the Current in its course, read it as serious heart difficulty which is prevented from coming to a fatal conclusion by the repair signs. 

With breaks examine in the usual manner to see if they are health defects, and if found to be so, read the break as denoting illness; if it is not a health indication read it as an interruption in the affections. 

If the line breaks and runs up to Jupiter (58) it will be read the same as the line deflected to that Mount, or as a split line running to Jupiter, showing that Jupiterian qualities attract the client and that the break in the line, if a health defect, is due to a disturbance of heart brought about by the Jupiterian disposition to overeat. 

This will produce functional heart disturbance, which can be overcome by removing the cause. If the break be not a health indication, it will show that one of the Jupiterian type has caused the break, or that it has been caused by too much ambition or pride (Jupiterian qualities). 

Always examine the character of the line after the break, noting the changes in it which tell the outcome of this break. If the line afterward continues deep, it will be overcome, if it grows thin, or chained, or defective in other ways it will be a continuance of difficulties and the age at which each one of these changes occurs can be read from the line. If the line breaks under Saturn and rises to the Mount (59) first look for health defects. 

In this case gout and rheumatism are the Saturnian health defects that will probably complicate trouble with the heart's action, and rheumatism of the heart is often diagnosed from this marking. You can tell from the Life line about how serious the results will be. 

If this break is not a health indication it will show that either a Saturnian subject, or that Saturnian qualities have caused the break in the line. The greatest care should be used in making an estimate in all of these cases. 

The type of your subject will show how much he would likely be influenced by the several types either in a health way or in his affections. If the Heart line breaks under Apollo (60) it will be nearly conclusive proof that the difficulty is a health defect. 

Examine closely all other indications bearing on heart disease, for while this defect is natural to Apollo-nians, all of this type do not necessarily have heart disease. See if the broken line, as it goes up into the Mount, grows deep and red, if so it will add to the certainty of disease.

If it is not a health indication it will tell of the affections having been influenced by Apollonian qualities, or by one of this type. This break occurring in the line under Apollo is at age 43. 

If an Apollonian subject has caused strong attraction at an earlier age it will be shown by a chance line coming from the Heart line at an earlier age on that line, and running to the Mount of Apollo (61). 

If the line breaks under Mercury (62) it will not likely be a health defect coming from any type qualities of Mercury, from the fact that the position of Mercury registers sixty years on the Heart line, and the heart's action generally gets weaker at this age, and is likely to become disturbed. 

In seeking to discover if this break is a health indication, bear in mind the age and consequent liability to heart weakness. At this age it is not likely that an affection will cause the break, for the age of youthful love is passed. If affection toward a Mercurian has influenced your client, it will much more likely be shown by a chance line similar to (61), than by this break under Mercury. The usual investigation will probably disclose a health defect; if not, reason out the break, as is done with the other Mounts. 

In all of the breaks above mentioned, we have considered that the broken line has run toward a Mount. Many breaks do not, the line simply parts and shows a broken span. These are either health defects, or breaks in affection. Reason them all out according to their size by following the general plan outlined. 

If many breaks are seen in the line (63) your client has either had a constant recurrence of weakness in the heart's action or of broken love affairs. If the breaks come close together he is likely to have heart failure. 

If the ends of these broken lines turn down instead of rising to the Mounts (64) then the head strongly influences the subject at the times the breaks occur, and cold reason fights against warm sentiment. If the broken ends are short, head does not rule completely, but if the line merges into the Head line, reason obtains the mastery over sentiment (65). 

If the break is wide at this time, the subject never entirely gets over it; if it is narrow he does, though unhappy at the time. By noting each break it can be told at what age these events occur, and by noting where the ends of the broken line go you can tell what has caused them. 

The variations are infinite, but by applying the general principles you can correctly reason out each one. If the end of the broken line drops and cuts the Head line sharply (66), the thing which caused the break, be it health or affection, will seriously impair the head at the time the line crosses the Head line. 

If at the time this cut occurs on the Head line a star is seen on the junction of the two lines (67) an explosion will occur in the Head line, caused by whatever made the Heart line break (health or affection) and brain fever or even death may ensue. 

The latter must be judged from the Life line, and the condition of the Head line after the cut occurs. 

If an island be seen in the Head line, following the cut by the Heart line (68), the head will be left in a delicate condition afterwards, this delicacy lasting as long as the island is present, the age to be read on the Head line. 

If after a break in a Heart line, the line is chained (69), it shows that the heart never fully recovers from whatever caused the break. If after a break the line has an island or islands (70) it will be delicate during the time occupied by these islands. 


If after a break a well-marked star is seen filling the break (71) the subject will die suddenly or have a very serious attack of heart disease at the age the star comes on the line. This is more certain if seen under Apollo. 

If the line breaks and is cut by a cross-bar (72), the Current can hardly get by at all, and sudden death, by heart failure, will occur in 95% of cases. 

If a break has a cross-bar on both ends of the line (73), death from heart disease will occur in 99%  of cases. 

How serious every case is, judge by the difficulty there will be to repair the damage and get the Current into its proper channel again. 

In the latter case the best repair would be a sister line joining the ends of the cross-bars (74). In this case there would be great danger at the time of the break, but the Current could be led back by the sister line to its channel again. This serious defect is also well repaired by a square (75) in which case the Current gets into the box, and though it is a serious impediment to the heart during the time this break occurs, it will likely find its way into the Heart line again if the square be a good one. 


If a break in the Heart line has a dot well marked on the end of the broken line (76) it indicates a serious attack of heart disease at the age indicated by its position on the line. 

A very large, deep dot will indicate a probable fatality, a smaller dot, serious illness which may be overcome. The star is either a brilliant sign when seen on the line, or is an explosion. 

First, locate whether it denotes illness or affection. 

If illness, then it will be:
- heart disease
- a severe attack if it be a small star, or a badly formed one (77). 

If seen under Saturn it will add the complication of rheumatism of the heart. 

If the star is large and well formed (78), with the centre exactly on the line, it will indicate the explosion. 
- This means sudden heart failure at the age on the line at which the star appears. 

If after a star the line shows chains (79) the subject will have a serious attack of heart disease from which he will never entirely recover. 

If after a star there are islands (80) the subject will have a severe attack of heart disease with delicacy afterwards, most pronounced and severe during the periods covered by the islands. 

The age at which each event occurs can be read from the line of Heart. If after a star the line becomes thin and narrow (81) it tells that the illness shown by the star destroys the vigor of the heart, which is always weak afterwards, and the affections become cold and views selfish and narrow. 


The combinations of defects, and the character of the line in its different parts are possible of infinite variation. All along the line every variation of character means a different operation of the line during the period it lasts. 

The characteristics of each formation of the line have been previously explained; so in practice apply to each part of the line the characteristics which belong to that kind of a line, reading the age at which these events occur by their position on the line. Use color to strengthen all these matters. 

Remember big red stars indicate greater intensity than big white ones, and that yellow ones show more nervous, morbid, and ugly qualities. Every defect on the line means an event either of health or affection. Make this distinction by rules already laid down, and then tell what the defect means and how serious it is.

Keep always in mind the theory of the Current, what it is trying to do, and how well the line will enable it to perform its functions. 

Think of the stream as flowing smoothly or impeded by defects. You have the types as a basis for the whole work, and it is by using and combining this knowledge, and adapting it to each particular case, that you will be enabled to reason out what each event shown on the line means, how it will affect the subject, and whether it is repaired or produces destruction. 

Read the line slowly. Do not expect the meaning to come the first time you look into a hand. 

Do not be confused because it does not, but think it over carefully. 

<!-- Above all, never allow yourself to be rushed. Don't begin to read because you feel you must "say something." Don't say anything until you have it clearly in mind. Practice will increase the rapidity with which you can work, just as the child grows from the primer to his higher readers. Get the theory in mind first, then practise until you can apply it. All my effort in this chapter has been expended to teach how to read a line by using the general rules and indications and applying them to that line. I have dealt only with changes in the Heart line itself. -->

Understand each separate Main line thoroughly. This will <!-- , and when you have learned them all you will be able to --> let you understand all the combinations. 

<!-- The illustrations in this chapter serve only to put you in the way of reasoning out the possible changes in the line - they are only a few of the thousands which are possible. You will find it excellent practise to take pencil and paper and draw different combinations for yourself, learning to reason them out. Remember, reason and good judgment must stand at your side when judging the Heart line, and all other lines as well. -->
