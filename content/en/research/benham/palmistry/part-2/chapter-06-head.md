The line of the Head is the second line which receives the Electric Current when it enters our bodies through the finger of Jupiter. It runs <!-- , is the line which may be seen tracing its way --> across the hand below the line of Heart.

<!-- It is an important line, and innumerable experiments have shown that  -->

It absolutely indicates the subject's:
- amount of mentality
- kind of mentality
- power of mental concentration
- ability to exert self-control. 

<!-- The importance of this line will be recognized when we consider what  -->

The mind plays a tremendous part in the shaping of our destiny. 

No matter how fine the rest of the human machine may be, it can never operate perfectly unless there is a proper mental attitude. 

The mental attitude cannot be what it should be unless the brain is physically healthy and the subject possesses the ability to concentrate his mind and thus go through life with definite-ness of purpose. 

Mind is the force that enables us to alter our natural life map, makes us able to modify our type qualities, and, more powerfully than any other factor, influences the life of every human being. 

The kind of mind that each subject possesses will be largely the key to his future, for it makes him whatever he is, improves or mars his natural self, builds up or tears down the strong places in his character, and acts correspondingly with the weak ones. 

Thus, the Head line will demand the closest study to correctly determine the quality and quantity of brain power present. 

<!-- The Line Of Head 239 No. 82.  -->

The brain emanates the vital force that throbs along every nerve in the body. Whatever reflects it is also a wonderful revealer of disease, especially of those disorders termed nervous. 

<!-- As the human brain is locked within the skull and is so extremely delicate and sensitive that physical examination of it cannot be made with safety, it is only when accident has laid bare certain portions that its workings can be studied. Even the closest microscopical examination fails to reveal any essential difference in structure between the brain of a man of high intellectual endowments and blameless moral life and that of a criminal of the most brutal type.

This is verified in post-mortem examinations before a body of scientific experts.  -->

The brain is so carefully protected that it cannot be studied minutely during life. This makes us <!--  that we have not yet learned to locate in it the seats --> ignorant of how it leads to good and evil actions. 

But the hand is always present to be studied. The Head line shows the inner workings of the mind. 

<!-- Therefore, for the present we must be satisfied to use the Head line rather than the brain itself to discover the workings of the mind, and we can feel satisfied that it accurately records the information. 

All of the data which is incorporated in this chapter concerning the Head line is the record of careful examinations and verifications, and it is because these numerous examinations have been so universally accurate that I unhesitatingly state that the line of Head may be relied upon as a revealer of the amount and condition of the mentality of any subject.  -->

In the same way it is most accurate in disclosing diseases due to an impairment of the brain, and extending from it to the nervous system. In beginning a study of the line of Head, your first care should be to locate it, and if it be absent, to discover that fact. 

The mind, working through the brain, is the force which operates directly on all lines. This makes the Head line seldom absent, for it is the indicator of that which produces lines. 

However, often only a single line crosses the hand. You might not know whether it is <!-- , and you may be at a loss to tell whether it is --> the Head or the Heart line. 

In 99% of cases, such a single line is the Head line and it is the Heart line which is absent. 
- I think it best to read such single lines invariably as lines of Head. 

The Head line should not run to the percussion as does the Heart line. If it runs across the hand, as in No. 82, it shows the  abundant mentality the kind to be estimated by the character and color of the line. 

A short Head line (83) indicates that:
- the subject is not so " long headed" (has not strong mentality) or
- the subject's life is short and stops where the Head line ends.

Illness and duration of life are to be read on several of the lines and not on the Life line alone.


If a short Head line also has a short Life line, matching in length with the Head line (84), the fatality is quite certain.

If a star is seen on the end of this short Head line (85) the indication will be sudden death, the star showing the explosion. 

If a star be seen on the end of both the short lines of Head and Life (86) the fatality may be read confidently if seen in the right hand, or, as threatened, if seen in the left hand.

The larger and better formed these stars, the more certain the indication. 

A cross on the end of a short Head line stops the Current, ending the mentality, and producing death.
- But it is not so surely by apoplexy or in a sudden manner as if indicated by well-formed stars.

A cross on the end of a short Head line, and of a Life line (87) is nearly as strong as a star.

These defects stop the Current, and life cannot continue unless the Current flows freely. 

With these markings note in every case the type of subject, also color of the line or sign. 

If Jupiterian (predisposed to apoplexy), Saturnian (predisposed to paralysis), Martian (who has large blood supply in brain), these indications will be more serious, especially if found red or pronouncedly yellow in color. 

In all short Head lines the accompanying signs on the Life line, Mercury line, Heart line, and Mounts must be noted, in order to distinguish whether the subject lacks mentality or is predisposed to disease, as in the above cases. 

The long Head line per se shows abundant mentality and the short line less of it. 

<!-- The Line Of Head 243 No. 86. The Line Of Head 244 No. 87. --> 

In this examination for the length of the line, proportion must always be kept in mind.

If the Head line extends across the entire hand in a straight line (88), with a Heart line normal, it will show the preponderance of head and the subject will be out of balance in this respect. 

He will:
- be avaricious
- view all things from the mental standpoint
- make sentiment subservient to interest
- be practical in all things
- be more interested in whatever is capable of producing direct results than in beautiful things which please the eye or appeal to the heart. 

If this long, straight Head line has no accompanying Heart line, the subject will be cold, heartless, merciless, miserly, avaricious, extortionate, and demanding his "pound of flesh". 

The proportionate depth and character of all the lines must be noted. 

If the Head line be straight and long and also deep, it makes a stronger combination. When the Head line without the Heart line is found also long and it is straight and deep, it makes worldly interests greater and the subject harder and more avaricious. 

If this line is also red, it makes the subject aggressive in his avarice, and if yellow he will be doubly mean and hard. 

If the Head line be long, but thinner and smaller than the other lines, the head will be on a constant strain and must not be overworked or the brain will be wrecked. 

If the line be short, narrow, and shallow, it will be a pronounced indication of small mentality. 

If all the other lines are deep and well cut, and the Head line short and thin, it shows a person easily led, weak in mentality, the servant and creature of others, never the leader. 

So, together with the length of the line, must be estimated its size and proportion to the other lines, and the subject must be placed above or below the normal balance in accordance with the proportion found. 

In every case use both hands. If the line be short in the left hand and long in the right, the subject has developed his mentality. If the line be long in the left hand and short in the right, he has retrograded mentally, or else there is danger of fatality from the short line. 

Examine at once Life line, type, and all health indications to discover which. If the line be narrow and thin in the left hand and deep and well cut in the right, the subject is improving mentally. If this combination is reversed the opposite condition is present. 

If the line be long and straight in the left hand and shows the same formation in the right, but with the Heart line absent in the right hand, the subject is naturally grasping and self-interested, and these qualities in him have been tremendously increased until he has become intensely selfish and avaricious.

By noting in this way the two hands and their changed condition of lines, you will be able to read changes from the past to a present mental attitude, and can tell the subject how he formerly regarded certain matters and how he views them at present. <!-- The Line Of Head Part 2 245 No. 88.  -->
