All things which increase the size of the Mount increase its powers and effectiveness.
- This subject will be ardent, full of desire and warmth, passionate, generous, sympathetic, and will attract others. 

He will also be strongly attracted, will marry early, and in 99% of cases the union will be fruitful. 
- This comes from the converse of the reasoning applied to the restricted line. 

This converging line also indicates long life and a strong vitality and constitution. It is the presence of warmth as opposed to cold. 

Generally:
- the longer the line of Life, the longer will be the life of the subject
- the shorter the line, the shorter will it be. 

<!-- Experience has proven, however, that this general proposition, while in the main true, -->

But this is still capable of considerable variation. If taken absolutely as stated, it may lead to error. <!-- , and this must be reduced to the minimum. --> 

In my examinations of the hands of dead persons:
- many startling confirmations of their death have been found on the Life line
- but other dead persons have well-marked Life lines which run past the age of their death.

This might lead to the belief that the Life line is inaccurate if we did not understand the matter. 

**The fact is that the Life line shows the vigor and natural health of the subject.** 

But death is marked on the Heart line, Head line, Mercury line, and is indicated by chance lines and individual signs as well, and in those hands where death has occurred and the Life line is found intact, the indication of death is present in one of the other places mentioned (see hand of Albert Frantz).

It is because severe illnesses and death have been looked for on the Life line only, that so little proficiency has been attained in palm-reading. 

The Life line has been expected to perform a greater duty than it was able to do, and received the blame for ill-success that belonged to the practitioner alone. 

The indications of death were in <!-- each --> the hand of those who have died from disease, accident, violence, hanging, or electrocution. 
- These have been absolutely verified such premises if only they were sought in the proper place. 
- Sometimes that place was in the Life line, sometimes in other lines. 

<!-- This matter I desire to make very clear at this point, for it will prevent your falling into the same mistakes which have overtaken others.  -->

When the line is found strong, good, and long, we may safely assume that the strong constitution will uphold that life in its natural course until old age is reached. 
- The shorter the line, the shorter is the period that this vitality will remain <!-- in full operation --> and the sooner will the subject have to depend on a careful handling of his forces to ensure the continuance of life. 

The two hands are most necessary in the examination of the Life line. 
- A naturally strong constitution shown by a long, deep line in the left hand may be found ruined in the right hand by a chained line.

In every case, you can read:
- the natural condition correctly from the left hand
- the present state from the right hand. 

These changes will be shown by the character of the line. 

You will often encounter a short Life line in one hand and a long one in the other. 

If the longer line occur in the right hand, this must be read as prolonging of life and strengthening of constitution. 

If the shorter is in the right hand, it must be read as the shortening of the life. 

<!-- Nowhere is it necessary to use both hands more continually than in examinations of the Life line.  -->

In all hands where good, long Life lines are seen, feel sure that the natural vigor will last a long time

in all hands where a short line is seen, there is a danger point indicated for that subject at the termination of the short line. 
- This cannot with safety be ignored by him. 

The character of the line is most important, for from it you read the muscular strength, robustness, and vigor of your subject. 

If the line be deep and well cut, the Current is coursing in a good supply through a deep channel, and your subject is strong, vigorous, full of vitality, will resist disease, and have few illnesses. 

These strong lines are found most often on phlegmatic persons, for these subjects live on muscular strength, not nervous energy. 

So the deepest lines are in the hands having the least sensitive nerves, and consequently the fewest lines. 

The lives of these subjects are more even, for they worry little and are not burdened with delicacy and poor health. They are capable of great exertion physically. In connection with consistency of the hands the deep-cut Life line is important to note. If the line be shallow and broad or chained, the subject, even with elastic consistency, will not possess the energy of one with a deep line. The subject with a deep Life line has more ability to throw off worry and remain calm in moments of excitement. 

He is endowed with vigor of constitution, is filled with self-confidence, and inspires it in others. He is intense in everything he does, work and play alike. 

If a Life line be deep and long it will show that the vitality and robustness continues during the entire life, but most Life lines become thin at the lower end, when the vitality naturally wanes. Vigor, strength, health, ardor, self-confidence, intensity, and energy sum up the attributes of the deep-cut Life line, and this line will affect all of the types. 

The strength and vigor will increase the Jupiterian propensities to "eat, drink, and be merry" leading to drunkards. 

If the third phalanx of Jupiter be very full and the color of hand and line red, your subject is likely one who has already indulged heavily. 

He has, however, only the illnesses which are produced by excess, as his strong Life line shows, and he can indulge in a good deal of dissipation before it begins to impair his vitality. This subject lives a life free from disease and generally drops with apoplexy. 

The same danger is present with a strong Martian type, especially with red color and red hair. 

The deep Life line makes the Apollonian a strong, healthy fellow, one to make his way through the world with ease. 

The Venusian is intensely passionate, and so strong in health and vitality that the exercise of natural Venusian passions is much increased. 

In all cases it is the addition of good health and great vitality to the type, and with this idea in mind you can reason out the various combinations. 

A narrow and thin line indicates less vitality, less robustness, less resistance to illness, and greater liability of the subject to be overcome by various troubles of health. 

The thin line does not mean that the subject is necessarily delicate or sickly, but it shows that he cannot endure as much hardship, exposure, or resist disease as well as a subject with a deep Life line. In all character of Life lines observe the proportion to the other lines. 

If the Life line be deep and all other lines thin or nervous, the subject will go through life with less worry and fewer nervous spells. 

If the Life line be thin and all other lines deep and well cut, the subject will be continually overstrained and health will surely suffer, for the thin Life line is not of sufficient size to carry the amount of Current which is flowing through the hand. 

The result of such a combination will be that the health will give way at some point in the line. The thin Life line is not distinctly a nervous line, yet the subject with such a line will be more nervous than one with a deep line. 

He will be apprehensive of coming evils, he seems instinctively to feel that the tension on health is great, and he fears the day when it will be overstrained. 

In choosing persons to go through great privations, such as explorers and prospectors, select those with deep and well-cut Life lines, not subjects with thin lines.
