There are so many possible combinations in Life lines.

 <!-- that an indefinite number of illustrations could be given, and yet not a fraction of the possibilities be shown.  -->


You can correctly decipher every line by:
- handling every variation of the line according to the general rules on the different characters of lines, and
- following the method of reading in 187

Back of all of these delicacies of constitution there are causes which produce them, and these causes are the health defects of the types, which in most cases are chronic ailments.

Having discovered that your subject has a weak constitution, endeavor to discover what has made it weak. 

In this examination. the type of the subject will tell to what he is predisposed.

After you have located his type or combination of types, look at the primary Mount for grilles, cross-bars, crosses, or any marking which will enable you to locate a health defect of the type. 

If one be seen, go over the list and look at nails, color, Mercury line, and from some of these you will be able to locate which one of his type health defects has undermined the constitution. 

With this information you can tell him not only that he is constitutionally weak, but what is the cause. 

If you see no health defect of his primary Mount, look to the second, and tertiary, and all the other Mounts for health defects. 

It is written somewhere, if only looked for in the right place. Sometimes a chance line will point from the delicacy on the Life line to the cause producing it, and generally it will be found on one of the Mounts. The individual signs, or as we have called some of them, "defects," in the line will locate specific points when illnesses occurred or will occur. 

These defects are cross-bars cutting the line, islands, dots, breaks, and splits. All lines which cut across the Life line interrupt or cut the Current, and at the time the cutting occurs they produce a defective operation which in the case of the Life line is one of health. 

In some cases, especially with very nervous persons, the Life line is continually cut by little lines which are fine and do not cut the Life line in two (188).

These lines show innumerable worries, the result of an intensely nervous condition, and the subject is prone to numerous small illnesses which have kept him in a continual state of depression or of ill-health. 

If these cross-bars be fine, the illnesses have not been serious but annoying, and there have been as many as there are bars cutting the Life line. If these bars be deep and cut the Life line, there have been severe illnesses.

If they be red the illness has been by fever. It is by the depth of these cross-lines that you must estimate their seriousness, and generally they will end somewhere on a Mount or line which will give you the clew to the nature of the trouble. The age at which these illnesses occur can be read from the Life line.

If a crossbar cut the Life line and end in a grille on Saturn (189), the illness will be a health defect of Saturn; which one you can determine from nails and color.


If the cross-bar go to a dot, island, or a break in the Heart line under Apollo (190), the illness is heart disease; the outcome can be read from the Heart line or the termination of the Life line. Nails and color will aid to confirm the diagnosis.

If the cross-bar run to a wavy line of Mercury (191). the illness is jaundice or severe bilious fever; age in all cases to be read from the point at which the cross-bar cuts the Life line. 

If the crossbar run to a grille on Upper Mars (192), with the Martian type strong, the trouble will be either blood disorder or throat and bronchial trouble. 

Nails will confirm the latter, or islands on the line of Mercury. If the cross-bar go to a grille or cross on the Upper Moon (193), bowel trouble or intestinal inflammation is the difficulty.

If the cross-bar run to the middle of the Mount of Moon (194), especially if grilled, gout or rheumatism is the difficulty. 

This is completely confirmed if a line with an island runs to Saturn (195). This double indication is reliable even though no grille or cross is found on the Mount of Moon. 

If the cross-bar goes to a grille, cross-bar, or cross on Lower Moon (196), the trouble is with kidneys or bladder, or from female disease.

White color and soft or flabby hands, transparent in appearance, will confirm the former; a star in the Mercury line, especially if at the point where it crosses the line of Head, will confirm the latter (197).

If the Life line is good with the above markings, the type defects are natural to the subject, as shown by the grille or other defects on the Mounts. 

However, the strong Life line shows a vigorous constitution and ability to resist and throw off disease, consequently the chronic trouble only manifests itself in a severe illness, not by a prolonged period of delicacy. 

If the Life line be thin, chained, or broad and shallow, these crossbars will be found more frequently, for the constitution is not robust and cannot shake off the type health defects as in the case of the deep line. With all cross-bars note the Life line after it is cut, and it will tell whether recovery is complete or not. 

If, after a cross-bar cutting a thin Life line and running to an island, dot, cross, or break on the Head line, the Life line has an island and becomes broad and shallow afterward (198), the subject, naturally not robust, has a severe attack of brain trouble which leaves him delicate, and from which he never regains his normal strength. 

The head is also left delicate as a result of this illness, shown by the island on the Head line. Sometimes the cross-bars cutting the Life line begin on Influence lines on the Mount of Venus (199).

In these cases, worry concerning the influence has caused the illness shown by the cross-bar. 

This is especially true if the Influence line be deep and strong. 

If the cross-bar run to a narrow quadrangle (200), it will be a sign of asthma ; the narrowing of the quadrangle as a health indication shows a tendency to suffocation, and this has been found to relate to attacks of asthma. Always see the narrow quadrangle before using this reading, as that is the thing which locates the disease ; a line running into a normal quadrangle would not give such an indication.

If a cross-bar run to a ladder-like line of Mercury (201), it shows that the illness comes from stomach trouble, as that is the weakness shown by such a Mercury line.
