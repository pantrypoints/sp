If the Life line forks at the termination (263), it shows that the Current separates, and, going in two directions, there is only one half as much chance that the life may be continued past the end of the line as with a single line. 

If both branches are deep, strong lines, it is more of an indication that life may be prolonged than if the forks are thin lines. 

This is a case where the vitality wanes, and as division is weaker than union, this forked termination of the Life line shows the rapidly dissipating vitality. 

If the line is short, small encouragement of long life can be given a subject with such a termination. 

If these forks are close together (264), it is a better indication than if they diverge widely (265).

If the line ends in 3 prongs (266), the dissipation of the vitality is more complete. This is more certain if all three of the forks are thin.  In this case, the vitality will be dissipated when this point is reached. 

If the middle fork is strong and deep (267), it may be a new lease of life beginning to manifest itself. The subject might live past the end of the line. 

A line ending in a tassel (268) shows entire dissipation of the vitality and end of the life. Such tassels are frequently seen from 60 to 656 years of age.  When it is natural for an end of the life.

If the tassel appears early in the line, it shows:
- premature dissipation of vitality
- death at the age when the tassel is seen. 

In many works on Palmistry, this tassel means "Poverty in old age." This is incorrect. 

I have seen it in the hands of old men who were rich. The vitality was fast diminishing, however, as the age neared the point of the tassel. 

Sometimes, the Life line runs to a certain age and then crosses the hand to a Mount. 

If there is no health defect on the Mount it will show that the quality of the Mount largely influences the life course of the subject. 

If a grille, cross, dot, cross-bars, or any defect on the Mount is present, the indications are that the disease peculiar to that Mount took hold of the subject at the age the line deflected from its regular course. 

For instance, if at 30 the line is so deflected and runs to the middle of Mount of Moon to a grille, gout or rheumatism will be the disease which afflicted the subject.

Whenever the line runs to a defect, the disease peculiar to the point where it stops is the one to look for. This marking running to Lower Moon is most frequent in the hands of women, and indicates female weakness.

If the line ends in a cross (270), the life will terminate at that age, and the disease can be determined by the usual search through the hand. This is a sudden ending of life, and there will be no lingering illness.

The more perfectly the cross be marked, and the deeper its lines, the more certain is the indication. If a cross-bar cuts the end of the Life line (271), it is the sudden ending of the life.

In all these cases the usual methods of examination will disclose the cause. It is absolutely necessary with every termination of the Life line to examine both hands.

If the line and termination in the left hand be good and strong, and one of the defective terminations is seen in the right, it is certain that something has changed the natural life course. The subject may have acquired a vicious habit which will shorten his days, or may have developed some serious malady.

In such a case locate the trouble, and by telling him what the outcome will be, he may be induced to abandon the habit, if such it is, and avert the catastrophe. 

In every instance by remembering what the two hands stand for, you can accurately estimate the case. If the line ends in a dot (272), your subject will die of an acute attack, the nature of which can be determined in the usual manner.

If the line ends in a star (273), the subject will die suddenly ; the cause can be located from the rest of the hand. 

You will encounter many combinations of all these signs in the termination of Life lines. By this time you have doubtless learned how to use them in combination, and can properly estimate them. 

Crosses will be found appearing in the Life line (274). These will be impediments to the life Current, and generally you will find on the Saturn line or the Apollo line some marking occurring at the same age. This change is generally the result of illness or accident. Crosses quite frequently indicate accidents.

Stars on the Life line are a menace to the life (275).

They have been verified many times as indicating sudden death. The type of the subject will have much to do with these signs. 

A fine line leaving the Life line and ending in a star near it (276) is also a dangerous sign, indicating sudden death. The star representing the explosion in the Life line, or at least an intense illumination, is not a safe indication to be found. 

The color of the line will be useful as a further confirmation of the strength or weakness of the constitution. White color diminishes the power of a deep and well-cut line, and the subject will not have as much robustness and vitality as if the line were pink. A deep and well-cut line, pink in color, will be the best for a Life line. 

Then neither deficiency nor excess of vitality is indicated, but a normal balance. Red color, with a deep line, is too intense, and the subject will be liable to febrile diseases, and also very ardent in everything, and will have strong appetites.

If stars, crosses, dots, or cross-bars are seen on a line which is very red in color, the subject will have some violent attack at the age indicated by the sign. Such a combination is most dangerous to the life. 

All markings which indicate febrile troubles or inflammations will be made more serious by a very red Life line.

Yellow color in the Life line will indicate chronic biliousness, and all the defects of health and character which are induced by bile will be aggravated. 

With such a subject the Mounts of Saturn and Mercury should be carefully studied, as well as all matters pertaining to those Mounts, for being of the bilious type, yellow color in the Life line will increase any health defect which these Mounts show. 

A wavy line or a ladder-like line of Mercury will be sure to indicate severe bilious complications and indigestion. Dots, crosses, cross-bars, breaks, or islands in the Mercury line must be looked for, as these will point directly to severe liver trouble in the shape of acute attacks of bilious fever or jaundice. If yellow shows in the Life line the whole character will be influenced by the irritating bile.

The subject will be cross, nervous, liable to fits of blues, and if any of the bad side of his type be indicated he will be vicious, and even criminal. A bad development of Saturnian or Mercurian type with a yellow line shows a trickster and cheat, and if the type be very bad indicates a vicious wretch who will delight even in murder. 

Blue color shows poor circulation and consequent heart weakness. This color present with a defective and badly colored Heart line and blue nails will indicate an advanced state of heart trouble. The bluer the Life line and the more indications of defective heart action, the more serious the estimate. With a blue Life line, stars on the line will be accurate as indication of sudden death by heart disease. 

Crosses, dots, and cross-bars are bad indications with blue color, but the star is the worst. Stars which are not directly on the line but near it, will have almost as much force as if on the line. All of the above observations in regard to color apply to thin Life lines as well as to deep and well-cut lines. 

A thin line which is exceedingly red is most dangerous, for the line is not strong enough to support the vitality shown by very red color. 

Yellow thin lines will make the subject small, petty, and mean. With chained lines or broad and shallow lines, white color makes them weaker. 

They have none of the strength which follows the presence of pink color. Subjects with thin lines are cold, sickly, complaining, and vacillating. They lack energy, and are not persons to be relied upon.

Pink color makes a broad and shallow or a chained line stronger.

The subject will have more vitality, and will not be despondent as frequently as with white color. 

Red will add more strength, but this combination is rare. When found, however, it should be regarded as no menace to these lines, for they need all the strength which can be given them.

Yellow color with broad or chained lines is a distressing combination. It will show inertia, intense nervousness, and an ugly streak of meanness in the subject. 

This combination produces a weak, sickly, nervous, petty person who will have a hard time to get along in the world. 

The line of Life is an intensely interesting study, and one which will amply repay any effort expended upon it. 

A mastery of the general principles which govern the various changes in the line, and its infinite combinations with other lines and Mounts, will enable you with practice to read it accurately. 

At first, the combinations may come slowly, but this should be no cause for discouragement. Patience and labor will enable any student to master it.
