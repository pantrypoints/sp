If the line of Affection fork at its termination (329), the affection will separate and become less strong. 
- Older palmists use this as a sign of divorce. 
- It is a likelihood of interference in the married life, but not always divorce. 
- It shows the beginning of the dissipation of the affections.

If the fork is not wide (330), the estrangement is not so serious as if it diverge greatly, as in No. 329. 

If the line end in a trident or a tassel, it shows the utter dissipation and scattering of the affection (331).


If branches droop from the line of Affection the married life will be full of sorrows and disappointments (332).

If branches rise from the line of Affection, the subject will be uplifted and the affection will be a benefit to him (333). 

If the line be broken it will indicate that the affection is interfered with or broken in some way (334). 

Look for repair signs. 

If the break is enclosed in a square, the subject will recover the disturbed affection (335).

If the line makes a hook on the Mount, the subject will lose his affection, which will not be regained (336). 

A dot on a line of Affection shows an impediment to the course of the affections (337). 
- The termination of the line shows the outcome. 


If the line ends in a fork, trident, or tassel the affection will be dissipated (338).

If after the dot, the line grows thin, the affection disappears gradually (339).

If Worry lines run from the Mount of Venus to the lines of Affection, and cut these lines, it shows that relatives are interfering with the married life of the subject (340). 



## Cutting Lines

If the cutting line runs from Influence lines on the Mount of Venus, it can show how close is the kinship of the relative who is causing the difficulty. 

If a line from a close line of Influence cuts a forked line of Affection, the married life of the subject will be interfered with by a near relative (341).

The forked line shows that the subject loses some enjoyment of the marriage relation through this interference. 

If the line of Affection end in a tassel, the reading is intensified (342). 


If a line of Affection cut by a bar has a chance line running to an island, a cross, a bar, or a dot in the Head line, an interference with the married life of the subject will result in some form of brain disturbance (343). 


In this manner, chance lines will be seen running from obstructions in the line of Affection to various parts of the hand, sometimes to defective Life lines, or health defects of the Mounts. 

In all these cases, the trouble pointed to will be brought on by an interference or blemish seen in the line of Affection. Each one of these defects in the line of Affection will indicate an event in the life of the subject. 

In all cases the lines of Affection should be read in combination with Influence lines on the Mount of Venus. As both relate to the coming into the life of a new factor, viz., someone outside of the subject himself, they are interdependent.


Be careful interpreting the marriage and home life. The goal of palmistry is to <!--  an examination of the hand is to --> give a client a better knowledge of himself. 

Unless the matter of marriage is so interwoven with his existence that the two seem inseparable, it is only gratifying curiosity to deal with it, and does no real good. 

When his career is being ruined or interfered with by adverse influences, these matters should be pointed out. Merely to tell about them in order to show whether you can do it or not, is lowering the standard of the profession. 


<!-- A surgeon would not amputate a limb to show that he knew how to amputate. , but he would do so if the limb needed amputating and the operation would help the patient.

 All palmists should proceed upon that idea. Do what is necessary for the help or guidance of the client, but nothing merely to exhibit skill. A strict adherence to this principle will win in the long run, and nowhere more surely than in the matter of the lines of Affection. -->
