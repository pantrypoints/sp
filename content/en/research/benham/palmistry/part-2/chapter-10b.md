A person with no Saturn line must depend on himself entirely. He should not trust to luck or fortunate circumstances. But if he would accomplish much in the world, it must be the result of his own efforts. 

The Saturn line may start (344) anywhere between the end of:
- the Life line and
- the Mount of Moon. 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/344.jpg)


Sometimes the line rises inside the Life line, and sometimes as high as the upper Mount of Moon. 

The course of the Saturn line is always toward the Mount of Saturn. 
- Sometimes, it reaches the Mount
- Sometimes, it falls far short. 

It always runs through the centre of the palm. 


## Starting Points

Course | Meaning
--- | ---
Rises inside the Life line, runs to the Mount of Saturn ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/345.jpg) | The subject will have material success in life and near relatives will assist him greatly
Rises from the centre of the palm (346), runs into the Mount of Saturn ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/346.jpg) | Success is largely from the subject's own efforts
Rises from the Mount of Moon, runs to the Mount of Saturn (347) ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/347.png) | Material success is from the help by one of the opposite sex. This may either be by good advice or by rendering financial aid. This is common in men where the wives have been of great assistance in their career
Starts higher up ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/348.png) | The subject will have a more negative existence for the first part of the life such as when he is so young that he can accomplish little by his own efforts. It shows that he was not born with a "silver spoon in his mouth"

The best period will begin at the time the line starts.
- The absence of the line does not mean that Nature is preventing the subject's advancement
  - It means that constant effort is needed
- The presence of a good line does show that some especial advantages are present during its existence.
  - It shows that the greatest efforts should be exerted if the largest results are possible

**The higher in the hand the line starts, the later in life will be the period of easiest sailing.** 

All other starting points are modifications of one or the other of them. 
- All readings should be modified in proportion as the source of the line is from these three pronounced centres. 


## Deficiencies

Whenever a deficiency is noted in the Saturn line you will find an explanation in some of the other lines or signs.


Course | Meaning
--- | --- 
Saturn line is absent at the start but Life line is strong. The Saturn line begins when the Life line weakens (349) ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/349.png) | The subject did little during the earlier years because he was delicate but will be productive later when his delicacy ends
Both the Saturn and Life line then might start thin but grow thicker | The subject will continue to do better in a business way as his strength increases

The Saturn line is read from the bottom. The Life line is read from the top. 

Use both hands with the Saturn line. 

Course | Meaning 
--- | --- 
The line rises late, along with a defective Head line at the start ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/350.png) | The subject will have his start in life impeded by brain weakness, and the Saturn line will not grow good until the Head line does.
The Head line is weak at the start. As soon as it recovers, the Heart line becomes weak, the Life line being thin all of this time ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/351.png) | The subject's career will be hindered first by head trouble, and then by heart weakness, and he does not begin to do his best until these have passed away.
The line rises high in the hand while the lines of Head or Heart are not defective | Look for health defects in other parts of the hand, on lines and Mounts. This is to discover the cause of the absence of the Saturn line.
The line begins low in the left hand, rising high in the right | The natural course of the line was favorable. The defects in the right hand show that something has occurred to alter the original plan. This may be health, laziness, or influences from family, friends, or outsiders. Mere chance cannot produced the change.
The absence of a Saturn line where it should normally begin | Some accident to the parents. This early period of the line covers the childhood of the subject. It will not be through his own fault that the start in life is not as good as it should be.
The line of Saturn rises high in the hand, and a line of parental influence on the Mount of Venus ends in a star early in the line ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/352.png) | The death of a parent has prevented a good start in the life of the subject. 


 <!-- alteration we must look somewhere for the unfavorable condition which has prevented the rising of the Saturn line low in the right hand.  -->

All indications on the Saturn line refer to financial affairs. Next in order the character of the Saturn line must be noted. 


If the line be not so deep as the other lines on the hand, the indications peculiar to the line are not in their proper proportions and will not be as strong as if all the lines were in balance. If the line be very deep and clear cut (353), the subject will be found to have exceptionally fine qualities, with a proper use of which he should be enabled to achieve great success. 

If this deep line extend up on to the Mount of Saturn, these favorable conditions will continue during the entire life. If the line be short, they will be present only during the length of the line, the age to be read from the line. If this deepness of the line be early in life, the subject will have his best period during childhood (354). 

This is an unfortunate marking, for at this age the subject is seldom old enough to take advantage of opportunities. 

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 3 503 No. 352 The Line Of Saturn Part 3 504 No. 353. The Line Of Saturn Part 3 505 No. 354. The deep line of Saturn is the most favorable line to possess.  -->

Course | Meaning 
--- | ---
A thin line (355) ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/355.png) | The subject has much natural advantages. But he will have to exert himself more to bring forth great results than a subject with a deep line
A deep line | The subject will still have an easier time to succeed than one with a defective line or with no line at all
A broad and shallow line (356) ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/356.png) | This is a little better than no line at all. |
If only the Saturn line is broad and shallow and the other lines are well marked | The subject will have continual struggles | 
Chained line | The career will be a hard one.
The line is chained during its entire length ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/357.png) | The subject will have continuous obstructions. Life will be a labored one, full of disappointments
The line is chained only part of the way | The difficulties will last during this condition. 


Color indicates the strength and condition of the Blood Current. 
- It does not affect the line of Saturn, as it does other lines. 
- This is because this line is not an index of the health or the disease of the subject.<!-- , and thus the line of Saturn will be the first line to which it is unnecessary to apply the color test.  -->
