Cross-bars cutting the Saturn line (367) are obstructions to the career of the subject. Each one of the bars is a separate obstruction, and by noting the depth of each you can tell how serious it is.

If only faint lines which do not cut through the Saturn line but pass over it, they indicate continual annoying interferences and impediments. 

If they cut the line in two, they are serious checks which threaten to destroy the success of the subject. The age at which each of these interferences occurs can be read from the Saturn line, their seriousness by the depth of the cutting line, their cause from other lines and signs, and their outcome by the termination of the Saturn line. 


Breaks in the line (368) are most serious.

At the time they occur some force has checked the career entirely.

These breaks indicate an entire change in the course of a subject's life-work if the line:
- takes a new character
- starts in a new direction or
- does not start at all, 


A repeatedly broken Saturn line indicates a continual number of reverses.
- The subject will have a laborious and troubled life.

Each break indicates a different misfortune, and is more or less serious as the break is wide or is repaired. 

The age of each break can be read from the Saturn line.

If the line be broken in many places but is repaired (369), the subject after numerous disappointments will fight his way eventually to success.

It will be a continual fight, however, and such a subject will require great will power to carry him along. 

With breaks in the Saturn line both hands should always be examined, for from them you will read whether all of the impediments in the line are a part of the natural plan or are the result of acquired habits, mistakes of calculation, ill health, or other causes. 

In a large majority of cases, the Saturn line is much better in the left than in the right hand.
- It shows that many of our trials are brought on by ourselves. 

If a line of Saturn be uneven (370), alternately deep and thin in character, the subject will have intermittent periods of prosperity.
- It indicates an unreliable and varying state of affairs. 
- He must use continual watchfulness in order so that what he gained will not be lost during the periods of the thinness of the line

If the line of Saturn is wavy (371), the subject will follow a constantly changing course.

- If, in addition to its wavy course, this line be uneven or defective in other ways, the subject will have increased difficulty in his journey through life.

If a line of Saturn begins deep at the base, and runs to the line of Head and there stops (372), the career of the subject will be favorable up to 30, when errors of judgment will interfere. 
- From that time he will have a harder time to get along; 
- He must rely entirely upon effort, not chance, and do the best he can to force his way. 
- His period of greatest production has passed.

After the age at which a line of Saturn stops, the subject will have to exert great effort in order to accomplish much, as it is during the life of the line that he must achieve the greater part of his results.
