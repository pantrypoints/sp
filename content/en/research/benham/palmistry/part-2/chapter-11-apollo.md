THE line of Apollo is a vertical line rising. 
- If long it rises from the upper part of the Mount of Moon
- If short it rises higher in the hand, running toward the Mount of Apollo

It sometimes ends high on that Mount, and sometimes not reaching to it.

It is also called:
- the line of the Sun
- the line of Brilliancy

To it has been ascribed the gift of great artistic talents, wealth, and fame. 

<!-- It is one of the most thoroughly misunderstood of all the lines, and the mistaken reading of it has caused practitioners many mortifications.  -->

<!-- Whenever a good line of Apollo was seen, it has been customary to "gush" about the wonderful talent the subject possessed for art, music, the stage, and various other artistic callings, of which perhaps no idea had previously entered his mind. 

Often a subject especially well fitted to be a good housewife has been made to feel indignant towards her parents by some well meaning palmist because alleged latent talents were not discovered and developed. Many such have been told that the world was the loser because they have never entered their proper sphere.

Sometimes, these great talents have been ascribed to people who were color blind or musically deaf, and both palmist and client have wondered at the failure of a good line of Apollo to give the proper indication. 

This has not been entirely the fault of practitioners, for such interpretations have been sanctioned by the best authors.  -->

In many cases conscientious palm readers have dropped the use of the Apollo line entirely, deeming it unreliable and misleading. 

<!-- This is certainly true of it according to its present understanding, and it had much better be dropped than used as extravagantly as it has been in the past.  -->

The line of Apollo, running as it does to the Mount of that name, emphasizes the Apollonian traits and qualifications.

<!-- It indicates brilliancy, and a knack for art and artistic callings". -->

<!-- Such is the reasoning from which the present interpretation of the line was derived, and it would be good reasoning if one factor had not been forgotten. -->

<!-- The Apollonian has many sides to his character; there are good, bad, and indifferent subjects of this type. He also moves in one of the three worlds, the mental, practical, or material, in any of which he may be brilliant and successful, and in any of which he may secure fame or wealth. 

But if an Apollonian who is built to shine in the material world has a good line of Apollo, and you tell him he is a great artist, you have placed him out of his sphere, and made an error which counts against the accuracy of the science of Palmistry. 

If this same subject had been told that he was brilliant in the world of material matters, perhaps a successful gamester, an owner of racehorses, a leading butcher, or foremost in other callings in which some Apollonians engage with success, the estimate would have been correct. 

It is the reading of a line of Apollo as always indicating wealth and fame derived from artistic pursuits that has impaired its usefulness and successful application. 

It is the attempt to make the line of Brilliancy always indicate brilliancy in art, which is only one of the directions it may take, and the disregard for the fact that a subject may be brilliant in many directions, that has made the reading of the line of Apollo so inaccurate.  -->

<!-- The line of Apollo, like all other lines, can only be successfully used when it is made to fit the subject. 

It is only accurate when the subject has first been understood and the line has been applied to him, and it never has been and never will be accurate when the attempt is made to force every subject to fit the line. --> 

A better name is the Line of Capability as it shows capability or possibility of accomplishing a great deal.

<!-- , the field in which the capability will best operate to be shown by Chirognomy, indicating the forces behind, which will direct the ability into some calling which produces results.

A good line of Apollo is undoubtedly an indication of the possession of the characteristics of the Apollonian, who makes friends, money, and reputation more easily than any other type.  -->

But in reading the qualities of the line be sure that you have placed the subject in his proper world, after which you can successfully apply the brilliancy indicated by the line to the affairs of that world.

There are not many really fine Apollo lines. Many hands will have no Apollo line at all. 

A fine line of Apollo shows that the subject has exceptional talents for getting on in the world.

A fine line of Apollo is ruined by:
- a flabby hand
- a weak thumb
- a poor Head line
- poor Mounts of Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus, or
- other deficiencies

<!-- In making a final estimate of the worth of any lines, these factors must all be taken into account.  -->

Having no line of Apollo does not mean that a subject will be unsuccessful.

 <!-- for, as in the case of an absent line of Saturn, the qualities that make "self-made men" may exert themselves, and produce even greater results than come from the brilliant talents which a fine line of Apollo indicates.  -->

In most cases, people with good Apollo lines rely too much on their talents, and not enough on the industry and perseverance.

This is why less talented plodders often produce greater results in life than their far more talented brethren. 

If the talents of a fine line of Apollo are coupled with energy, almost unlimited success is possible. 

<!-- It is absolutely incorrect to say that the absence of a line of Apollo indicates ill success in life, but it is true that  -->

The presence of this line makes success easier in one of the 3 worlds as shown by the three phalanges of the fingers. 

It must be understood then that in the treatment of this line, when we use the word success, it applies to effort in the world in which the subject moves. 

<!-- Remember that the proper world to which the line must be applied is determined by examination of the three worlds of the hand as a whole -->

Like the Saturn line, this line does not give any health indications. 

The effect of ill health may be seen as affecting the line, but the line itself will not give these indications. 

The length of the line determines the extent of its influence ; the longer the line the more it will sway the subject, and the shorter, the less important is it found to be.


A line of Apollo reaching from the wrist to the Mount indicates the possession of great talent, so great that it will continue to develop during the life of the subject, and he will achieve much (423).

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/423.png)

If the line begins low and runs only a short distance, the subject has talents, but they will not be productive of great results (424). 

If the line rises higher and covers the space between the Head and Heart lines, the special brilliancy of the subject will operate during the formative period of life, and will be of assistance in aiding him to pass this critical period with greater ease (425).

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/425.png)

If the line runs on to the Mount, the subject will be well endowed with Apollonian characteristics, and in whichever world he moves will be brilliant and acquire reputation (426). 

Frequently the lines of Saturn and Apollo are interdependent, and in many cases one will be strong at a time when the other is weak. 

In such an instance they operate upon each other as sister lines, and one repairs the damage to the other (427). The presence of a good line of Apollo with the Saturn line absent will compensate for the loss of that line.

If the line of Apollo be present, then disappears, and afterwards begins again, the talents of the subject during the period covered by the break in the line are simply latent (428). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/428.png)


The period of life covered by this break can be read according to the scale laid down in Chapter 4 (The Age Of The Subject). 

There may be a special cause why the line vanishes for a time, as ill health may render inoperative even the most brilliant talents. With such a break look for defects in the other lines and Mounts which may account for it. 

If during this period the Life line be in any way defective, delicate health is against the operation of the subject's talents (429). 

If at the age indicated by this space in the Apollo line, the Head line be defective, the mental power of the subject is weakened, and he cannot give the attention necessary to make his affairs successful (430). 

Similar defects seen in other portions of the hand, whether connected by chance lines to the space in the Apollo line or not, show something which has for the time being impeded the career of the subject, by suspending the operation of his strongest talents. 

To be regarded as a true line of Apollo, the line must begin low in the hand, directly under the Mount and finger of Apollo.
