If a rising split from the Head line runs to a bar on the Mount, an error in calculation will cause a check to the subject's career from which he does not recover (455). 
- Often this refers to investments made early in life, and which turn out badly.

![Apollo Bar](/graphics/palm/455.png)

A cross on the end of the line of Apollo (456) is a worse obstruction than a bar as it means:
- an absolute blemish to his reputation.
- poor judgment
  - He will make many mistakes in life, which consequently terminates unfavorably. 

All of these terminations we are presuming to happen on good lines of Apollo.

If they should occur on poorly marked, defective lines, their reading must be intensified, and made to agree proportionately with the poorness in quality of the line.

A square on the end of a line of Apollo (457) shows protection from evils of all sorts. It will exert its influence not only on the end of the life, but during the whole of it.

This is largely true of all signs that terminate a line of Apollo. But it is particularly true of the square.

If a square should surround any of the unfavorable terminations of the line, it will to a large degree mitigate them.

**An island on the end of the line of Apollo (458) is a most unfavorable indication.** 

![Apollo Island](/graphics/palm/458.png)

No matter how good the line may be, this marking will cloud his latter days as it shows the loss of money and reputation. 

A fork on the end of the line of Apollo (459) shows that:
- he has talent in more than one direction
- this diversity of talent will cause him to do less with what he has than if his efforts were concentrated.

A well marked trident on the end of the line of Apollo (460) is nearly as good a marking as a star. It indicates celebrity and wealth from mental efforts.

If two parallel sister lines are seen on the Mount one on each side of the Apollo line (461) they give their added strength to an already fine indication. 

![Apollo Star](/graphics/palm/461.png)

The line of Apollo is intensely favorable by itself, but when supported on both sides by strong sister lines, the subject will have the greatest success.

These were named by older palmists lines of reputation. 

If the Apollo line runs to the Mount, and on the Mount there are several or many vertical lines (462), the subject will have some talent in many directions, and because of this diversity he will accomplish little. 

If the Apollo line ends in a tassel (463) the subject will scatter his efforts in so many directions that he will accomplish little. Talent he has, but too diversified. 

If on the end of the Apollo line, one branch goes to the Mount of Saturn, and one to the Mount of Mercury (464), he will have combined wisdom (Saturn), brilliancy (Apollo), and shrewdness (Mercury). With this combination he will reap wealth and renown.

![Apollo](/graphics/palm/464.png)

Branches or fine lines rising from the line of Apollo (465) will increase the good effect of the line, and when seen on a good line will make the success of the subject more certain. 

His life seems buoyant enough to rise over obstacles that may get in its way. Thus he floats over the top of difficulty instead of being dragged under by it. 

Fine lines falling from the line indicate that the subject will need greater and more constant effort to achieve success.

He will have an up-hill pull, and there will be times when the load gets very heavy. He does not overcome obstacles easily, and such a line bears no such promise of a brilliant life as when the branches rise. 

Branches which leave the Apollo line and run to other lines, signs, or Mounts, will each have a special meaning, which is to be read from the place where they terminate.

A rising branch going to the Mount of Jupiter will show that, coupled with great talent, the subject has strong ambition and the power of leadership.

With this combination he will be successful, and is sure to win fame if he does not secure wealth. If in addition a star be seen on the Mount of Jupiter the ambition will be crowned with success. If a star be also seen on the Mount of Apollo (466), he is certain to achieve great renown. 

If such a marking be seen, the Chirognomic indications should at once be studied. A soft hand, large Mount of Venus, and conic tips will make him a musician. He will love melody best and those gay, tuneful compositions which appeal to the heart and move the feet. 

If a large Mount of Moon be added he will also love classical music. If the fingers be square he will have rhythm and metre, and compose well. If tips be spatulate he will have the power of execution and be a brilliant performer. If the fingers be square and the tips spatulate, he will be a composer and performer as well.

These are in the artistic world. If the practical world rules, he will be a great money-maker, will lead the business community wherever he lives, and attain celebrity in this direction. With the lower world predominating, he will be a money-maker, but loud, and coarse, and will dress and live with vulgar display.

If a branch from the Apollo line rises to the Mount of Saturn, wisdom, soberness, frugality, a scientific turn of mind, and the balancing qualities of Saturn will increase the success of the subject. 

With this combination, if his mental world predominates, he will excel in occult sciences, chemistry, physics, or mathematics. If his fingers be smooth he will be guided by inspiration in these matters ; if with knotty joints he will be the reasoner and calculator ; square fingers will give him great exactness, and spatulate tips originality. This Apollonian-Saturnian will not be led by traditions, but will think for himself. 

All of these faculties will increase the certainty of his success and fame. If a star be seen on the branch to Saturn, the qualities of that Mount will bring great success. 

If in addition one be seen on the Mount of Apollo (467), the success of the subject is more certain. 

![Apollo](/graphics/palm/467.png)

If the practical world rules, the subject will gain wealth as well as fame from his efforts, and if the lower world be strong, he will be economical, frugal, and even stingy. 

If the thumb be stiff this will be more certain. If with this marking the band be bad, the subject will be most successful in his meanness. 

If crosses, bars, dots, or other defects terminate the lines, the subject will be unsuccessful and will lose instead of gaining reputation. If the lines have sister lines on the Mounts, he will have the greatest success (468). 

If the lines should not reach the Mounts, and on the Mounts are seen many vertical lines, the subject will fail of ultimate success by reason of too great a diversity of effort (469). 

If a branch from the line of Apollo rises to the Mount of Mercury the qualities of that Mount will come to the assistance of the subject. He will have shrewdness, business ability, a scientific turn of mind, and great powers of expression, in addition to all the train of Apollonian brilliancies, and will achieve distinguished success in some direction.

If the mental world rules, this Apollonian-Mercurian will have fluency of expression, and make a successful author, writer, or speaker on any subject which he may study. If his fingers and tips be square he will choose common-sense, practical subjects. 

If conic or pointed, artistic or idealistic matters will be chosen. If spatulate be will be original in bis ideas and methods of expression, and if the fingers be smooth will depend upon inspiration. If his fingers be knotty he will have everything cut and dried, prepared in advance, and a reason for everything on the end of his tongue. 

If his fingers be long he will go into the detail, but if short, he will reach his climaxes and conclusions quickly. If the hand be elastic he will love to work, and will accomplish much, but if soft, the subject will do more thinking than executing. 

If the second phalanx of Mercury be long he will make a good doctor, especially if vertical lines be seen on the Mount of Mercury, or he may be a good lawyer and bring to bear in the pleading of his cases forensic ability from both the Apollonian and the Mercurian types. He will be studious, ingenious, and love scientific investigations. 

With every subject bring to bear all the Chirognomic indications in such cases ; thus you can tell from what standpoint every act will be executed. 

If with the subject marked as No. 470, the third phalanx of the Mercury finger is longest, he will be devoted to business, shrewd, calculating, keen, and hard to beat. 

He knows men thoroughly, reads character easily, and understands a good business proposition when it is presented. Spatulate tips will make him original, square give great regularity and system, elastic consistency will give him the power to do and to accomplish, and a large thumb the determination to use his powers. 

Such a combination is an indication of great success and wealth.

If stars be seen on the Mounts of Apollo and Mercury (470), the success is intensified; if crosses, dots, bars, or other defects, the subject will make costly mistakes. 

![Plate 470](/graphics/palm/470.png)

If with this marking the Mercury finger be crooked or twisted, or both, the subject may use his brilliant talents to get the best of people.

If a branch from the Apollo line rises to the Mount of Mars (471), the subject will have added to his Apollonian character the sterling qualities of Mars. 

Thus he will be self-reliant, able to defend himself, not easily discouraged, and if necessary will force his way through the world. If he be a mental type of subject, he will use these physical qualities to strengthen his mental ability.

If a material subject he will use his talents in the business world or he will be a soldier. If the latter he will win renown. 

If crosses, dots, bars, or other defects be seen on the Mounts of Apollo and Mars, the subject will have trials hard to overcome. 

If sister lines run beside the line on the Mount of Mars, the subject will have added renown. If a branch from the Apollo line comes from the Mount of Moon (472) the subject will have the power of imagination, the ability to paint word pictures, and a good power of expression. As an author he will be successful. 

If the hand be a musical one he will love only the classic form. If the lingers be smooth and tips conic, he will be an inspired writer and will deal in romance and poetry of a romantic character. 

If the fingers be knotty, he will write prose, and if at all poetic will incline to the epic form. If a star be seen on the end of the Apollo line the subject will achieve great renown from these spheres of action. If crosses, bars, dots, or other defects end the line, he will make errors which will interfere with his reputation. 

If a line runs from the Apollo line to a strong Mount of Venus (473) the subject will be passionately fond of music of a melodious character. 

This will be accented if the fingers be smooth and tips conic or pointed. If this subject be an instrumentalist, be will excel in expression and feeling. 

![Apollo](/graphics/palm/473.png)

If the fingers be square, he will excel in rhythm and metre, and if spatulate in technique. If he has square fingers and spatulate tips he will have both rhythm and technique. 

If with such a hand the consistency be soft or flabby, the subject will love to hear music, but will never have the energy to acquire proficiency in it. 

If a star be seen on the Mount of Apollo, the subject will achieve great distinction as a musician. If crosses, bars, dots, or other defects be seen on this line or the termination, they must be read as impediments to the musical success of the subject. 

A branch from the line of Apollo merging into the Head line (474) will indicate that the subject will receive support from his mental powers. If the Head line be strong and vigorous, it will show that a powerful brain has given him judgment and self-control which have contributed to his success.

The formation of a triangle at the point where the branch reaches the Head line is an indication of unusual mental power.

If a line from the line of Heart merges into the Apollo line (475) the subject will be much assisted by goodness of heart. Warmth of heart, sympathy, and an affectionate disposition make friends who materially assist in promoting the interests of a subject.


Influence lines from the Mount of Venus which run along the side of the line of Apollo show the assistance of relatives to the success of the subject (476). 

![Apollo](/graphics/palm/476.png)

These have often been read as legacies from relatives, but they do not necessarily indicate this particular form of help. 

They are sympathy, counsel, and support, as well as financial aid. If a line branching from the Heart line cuts the line of Apollo, the affections will stand in the way of the subject's success (477).

<!-- The line of Apollo, when based upon and fitted to the subject, can thus in many ways be made of wonderful value in the complete delineation of the hand. Standing as it does, when good, for a brilliant career, we cannot afford to pass it by because of errors that have crept into its treatment in the past. By keeping constantly in mind the fact that it does not always apply to art, but to every form of daily occupation, we can divest it of the inaccuracies that have grown around it when estimated only as relating to an artistic career. Remembering that it is the "Line of Capability," and that it indicates the possibility of a vast amount which can be accomplished in some direction, we may by the aid of Chirognomy tell in what direction the capability exists. 

By following the line from source to termination and by noting each variation in its character, each defect which may appear, all chance lines which merge into, cut, or run alongside of it, by noting the source of each of these chance lines, and by applying the qualities of this source as a help or hindrance to the line, you can reason out any formation or combination of the Apollo line which can possibly occur. -->
