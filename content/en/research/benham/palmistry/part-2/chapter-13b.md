<!-- It is from the type and Chirognomic make-up of a subject that you must determine which interpretation should be given.  -->

In every case, the Girdle shows some nervousness and some ardor. 

But to reach a correct estimate of the extent of either, you must:
- first correctly estimate the subject
- then apply the line to him. 

The person will be have intense nervousness and dejection if:
- the Mount of Venus is flat and flabby
- the Life line runs close to the thumb
- the color of the hand is white
- the third phalanges of the fingers are waist-like
- the Heart line thin

In such a case, a Girdle of Venus will not indicate lasciviousness, because the physical make-up of the person preclude such a possibility. 

Hysteria will be likely.


On the other hand, the person will have much lasciviousness, with a taste for drink and general debauchery, if:
- the Girdle of Venus is with a large Mount of Venus that is swollen, grilled
- the third phalanges of the fingers are thick
- the first phalanges are short
- the Life line runs wide into the palm
- the Heart line is deep and red
- the Mounts of Mars are full
- the color of the hand is red, with black or any approach to auburn or red hair on the hands

In this case, it is not a sign of nervousness and hysteria.


A Girdle of Venus on such a hand must be given the full strength of its old traditional interpretation. 

**All of his nervousness will become nervous energy which will be expended in gratifying animal appetites.**

The interpretation of the Girdle of Venus must depend entirely on the kind of subject. 

<!-- There is another danger from the Girdle of Venus, which comes to all types of hands which have it.  -->


## The Girdle of Venus as a Sign of Masturbation

The Girdle might show a transitory danger, or the formation of a permanent habit if not checked early in life. 

At the age of puberty, people with the Girdle of Venus tend to indulge in masturbation. 
- In people with animal hands, this arises from the passionate heat which finds its outlet in this way. 
  - With such people, the continuance of the habit is only slight because they quickly have relations with the opposite sex and do not continue it. 

In the very nervous hand, puberty brings a sense of desire.

- But in such weak physical natures, this is largely a menial condition. 
  - There is no real heat or warmth of physical passion.
  - The mind becomes inflamed and has lascivious dreams. 
  - Such people are full of imagination, but weak in physical heat. 
  - It gives them greater delight to think of intercourse than the actual experience. 
  - They easily fall victims to the habit of masturbation.

The person will, because of his imaginings, do masturbation if:
- the lower third of the Mount of Moon is largely developed
- the hand is thin, bony
- the Mount of Venus is flat
<!-- , Girdle of Venus  -->
- waisted third phalanges of the fingers
- Mounts of Mars is deficient
- Heart line is thin 

These people will find it hard to break the habit of masturbation because their lack of physical heat makes them prefer masturbation to actual intercourse. 

They:
- are shy, diffident, and retiring by nature
- do not court nor love the society of people in general, or of the opposite sex in particular.

Many such people are Saturnians.

In such a hand, if you look into the upturned palm intently, then look at the person without saying a word, an oozy perspiration will soon begin to form in the palm.

This will become more plentiful the longer you continue the experiment. 

Such subjects will not often deny that they masturbate. 

If these are seen in children's hands, ask the parents to give them good wholesome advice and plain talks to prevent the formation of this vicious habit. 


The Girdle of Venus is usually a single deep line. 

This is most often seen on the least nervous hands. This is why it is not so frequently an indication of hysteria as of increase of animal appetites.
