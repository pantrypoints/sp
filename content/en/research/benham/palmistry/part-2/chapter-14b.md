## Ring of Solomon: Occult

The Ring of Solomon is a small line rising between the fingers of Jupiter and Saturn.
- It runs downward and encircling the Mount of Jupiter, and ending near the beginning of the Life line (544). 

It is an indication of:
- a love for occult studies, and
- an ability to obtain proficiency in them if other necessary Chirognomic indications be present. 

It is most often seen in a much-lined hand, and generally a Croix Mistique is also found in the quadrangle. 

I have seen many subjects with this marking who have developed great aptitude for occult studies, and none in whose hands I have noted it have ever been lacking in a fondness for Psychology. 

It usually has great raying and lining which shows great impressionability and numerous emotions. Such subjects are always interested in new things. 

The Ring of Solomon by itself, however, is not a sign of proficiency in the realm of occult thought. 
- It is only an indication which should draw your attention in this direction. 

Before committing yourself to any extent on the occult powers of the subject, see if a good brain and other necessary adjuncts are present.

See if energy, ability to study, and perseverance are indicated. 

The cranks in the field of occult studies are the dreamy idlers who rely on inspiration or divine revelations, not on good reasoning.

Even a good Ring of Solomon will not rescue such a crank from the multitude of those who have done nothing but talk. 

People who have accomplished much in the psychic world have square or spatulate tips with knotty joints. Their success has been largely due to hard study and the application of good reasoning. <!-- The Ring Of Solomon 695 No. 544.  -->

The presence of a Ring of Solomon will help all of these students. The kind of subject on which it is seen must, however, be the guide in reading this line.


## Ring of Saturn: Restlessness, Crime, Suicide

The Ring of Saturn is a line which rises between the fingers of Jupiter and Saturn. 
- It encircles the finger of Saturn
- It terminates between the finger of Saturn and Apollo, crossing the Mount of Saturn completely (545). 
- Sometimes it makes a perfect circle
- Often it is composed of a couple of lines which cross on the Mount of Saturn.

In many cases, the circle is not entirely completed, but the ends will show that they form part of an imperfect Ring of Saturn (546). 

The presence of this line shows a disposition to jump from one occupation to another, and not to stick to any one long enough to make it successful. 

There is a lack of continuity of purpose in a subject having this marking, and poor success in his undertakings is the usual result. 

While this line, per se, does not make failure in life a necessity, it is to be seen on a great many hands where the lives have been unsuccessful. I have observed it on the hands of prisoners in penitentiaries, some of them the most desperate of their class. 

I have seen it also on the hands of a number of suicides. 

This Ring cuts completely across the Mount of Saturn and blocks the Current at that point. This:
- makes the Mount of Saturn defective
- shuts out the wisdom, seriousness, and balancing qualities of the Mount of Saturn and turns them into defects. 

These subjects will either develop into bad Saturnians, often reaching the stage where they stop at no crime, or else, as the balance-wheel is gone, they shift from one thing to another, with no continuity in any direction, until their lives are total failures. 

If in such cases the upper Mount of Mars be deficient, thumb small, and Mercury line defective, especially if showing islands or a star, the subject will give way to discouragement, and become either insane or commit suicide. 

Soft or flabby hands, vacillating Head line, weak thumbs, poor Mounts of Mars, or a large Mount of Moon are all poor companions for the Ring of Saturn. 

If with a Ring of Saturn the Head line slopes low on to a Mount of Moon which is large or grilled, or both, the subject will be imaginative in the extreme, flighty, restless, changeable, and will make nothing of himself. 

Often defects and obstructions in the line of Saturn, with the Ring of Saturn present, will show that the career of the subject has been ruined because of his lack of continuity of purpose.

The Apollo line will frequently be similarly affected. 

When searching the hand for the cause of some disaster or impediment which we see marked, the presence of a Ring of Saturn will often furnish us an explanation. 

As vacillation is indicated by a broken or islanded Head line, the Ring of Saturn with such a Head line will intensify the changeable character of the subject. 

Such a combination with a defective Saturn line will furnish an explanation of the impediments in that line. A similar combination will affect in the same manner a defective line of Apollo. 

The Lunarian is the most changeable of the types. He will be made much more so by a Ring of Saturn. 

It is hardly possible for such a subject to obtain enduring success. If the Ring of Saturn does not completely circle the Mount but is broken, it is not as unfavorable a marking as if it completed its course. 

In this case, some outlet will be left for the Current. The Mount of Saturn will not be made so defective. 

Even with this imperfect ring, however, there is a degree of its defect present, the subject having at least a tendency in that direction, and in a final estimate this fact must not be lost sight of. 

When the Ring of Saturn of two lines which cross each other on the Mount of Saturn (547) is a large cross on that Mount. This marking I have seen on several suicides. <!-- The Ring Of Saturn 696 No. 545.  -->

The Ring of Saturn warns of a grave danger. 

<!--  to the subject Knowing its meaning, be ready to search for all indications that may help him to overcome the vacillation which may ruin him. Apply Chirognomy, study his type and everything the lines can tell bearing on the subject of changeability of temperament. --> 

A strong will phalanx on the thumb with a good Head line are the best companions for a Ring of Saturn. 

With all the facts in your possession, you should be able to tell just how much influence the Ring of Saturn will exert upon any subject.
