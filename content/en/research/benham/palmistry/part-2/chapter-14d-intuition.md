The line of Intuition lies at the side of the hand near the percussion.

It rises on the Mount of Moon, and after describing a curve toward the Plain of Mars, ends on or near the Mount of Mercury.

It occupies the same position as the line of Mercury, but is distinguished from it by its curved formation, though I consider it practically a Mercury line. 

The presence of this line, if well marked, adds greatly to the intuitive faculty of a subject, though this may be only another name for Mercurian shrewdness. 

These subjects:
- receive impressions for which they cannot account, and
- form accurate opinions but are unable to give the source for these opinions

They have an added faculty of:
- sensitiveness
- keenness in estimating people
- adroit shrewdness in arriving at correct opinions concerning many of their fellows. 

Some subjects having this marking are not conscious of these faculties. They merely "feel it in their bones." 

**This faculty of receiving correct impressions from those you meet can be cultivated.** 

If a subject be unconscious of such powers and does not use them, he goes along feeling many things concerning other people, but dismisses the impressions from his mind as vain fancies. 

By allowing the impressions to take some definite form, for instance, by thinking of each person, "he impresses me favorably, or unfavorably," as the case may be, gradually the impressions will increase.

First, a subject may impress him unfavorably. The next impression may be that the subject is not honest or truthful, or that he is playing some part and not showing his real character. 

As he begins to put the impressions into words and give them form, they increase, and the ability to receive and classify them increases. 

I have noted this mark in the hands of celebrated spirit mediums (552). They tell me that:
- their inspirations seem to "come to them"
- impressions about their visitors form in their minds
- they often have mental pictures
- as they come to rely on these intuitions, **they find them increasing in number and accuracy**.

Whatever intuition is, it operates to give a mental impression from one person to another.

Those who have the line of Intuition in their hands have the highest degree of faculty of receiving these impressions.


If with a line of Intuition the hand be square, hard, and few lines be seen, the subject will dismiss his intuitions as foolishness. 

If the fingers be long, tips pointed, Mount of Moon full, Head line sloping, tip of thumb pointed, and a line of Intuition be seen, the subject will be a " Psychic." 

He will have visions, dreams, strong impressions of impending danger, and will see signs and believe in omens. He is dreamy, nervous, highly strung, and wears out easily. 

From this class genuine " Psychics" are recruited. They have been supposed to be those who can obtain the greatest proficiency in occult studies. 

They do not, however, for they do not want to study or work, but wish to rely entirely upon their impressions and visions, and, except in rare cases, never accomplish as much in any line as do those who use industrious effort thoughtfully expended. 

A deep line of Intuition will indicate the greatest amount of intuition, and broken or defective lines will show only a limited amount.

Islands in the line will show that the faculty will bring poor success, and islands in the beginning of a line of Intuition indicate a tendency toward somnambulism (553).

If the line of Head sinks low on the Mount of Moon and the line of Intuition cuts it, the mental forces will be injured by allowing too much imagination and intuition to have play. 

If a branch rises from a line of Intuition and runs to the Mount of Jupiter, the subject will be ambitious to accomplish something with his intuitive faculties; these are successful occultists (554).


If a line rises from the Hue of Intuition to the Mount of Apollo (555), the subject will achieve renown through the exercise of his intuitive faculties. 

If a hue from the line of Intuition cuts the Saturn line (556), the exercise of the intuitive faculties will impair the career of the subject.

In all of these cases, the subject will probably use these faculties as a medium or clairvoyant. 

If the line of Intuition ends in a star (557), the subject will have great success from the exercise of these faculties. 

If the Mercury development be strong, the subject will make money from the exercise of his intuitive faculties, or can do so if he wishes. 

If the Mercury development be bad the subject will resort to tricks and imposition to make money from the intuitive faculties. If crosses be seen on the line it adds to this indication. These are humbug clairvoyants, mediums, and fortunetellers. 

If a line from the line of Intuition merges into the Saturn line (558), the exercise of the intuitive faculties will assist the career of the subject. With good common-sense to back it, this line is a help to any hand. 

If the subject be so constituted that he is likely to become unbalanced from believing he is a medium or clairvoyant, a line of Intuition is a poor possession. With a careful estimate of the Chirognomic indications you can apply the line and tell what its effect will be on any subject, and this is the proper use to make of it.
