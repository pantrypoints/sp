This line is seldom seen. It runs as a sister line to the line of Mercury (559). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/559.png)


It generally occupies a slanting position rising from the inside of the base of the Mount of Moon and ending on the lower part of the upper Mount of Moon near the percussion. 


- If it goes with a strong line of Mercury and a sister line beside it, it shows a superabundance of vitality and good health
- If his hands are sensual, this superabundance will go into lascivious practices
- If his hands are not sensual, he would expend his surplus energy in whatever activity of his type

<!-- Because it occupies a slanting position, and does not rise to the top of the hand was another reason why the line was taken as indicating an operation in the lower world located at the base of the hand.  -->

If a Via Lascivia is deep and clearly marked, it will have a strong tendency to lower the subject in some directions. 

He will be more apt to think evil, even if he does not practise it.
- Temptation will more surely cause him to fall than if the marking were not in his hand. 

With a soft, pleasure-loving hand, full Mount of Venus, and a well-marked Via Lascivia, the subject will devote himself to pleasure, and will pursue it regardless of the cost in dollars and cents or in consequences.

If the Via Lascivia be seen, estimate carefully:
- the appetites of the subject
- the likelihood that he will be led where pleasure calls

If he is a voluptuary, the line will be a menace to his career.

If with such a line the Head line becomes defective, the excesses are affecting the brain. 

If with such a hand the Saturn line have islands, pleasure seeking will cause financial embarrassment. 

If with such a hand a dot or cross be seen on the Apollo line or Mount, the excesses of the subject will ruin his reputation. 

If a chance line run from a deep Via Lascivia and cut the line of Affection which ends in a fork (560), the lasciviousness of the subject will ruin his married life. 

If a rising branch from the Via Lascivia cut the Apollo line (561), the lascivious tendencies will ruin the success of the subject. The same reading applies to the line of Saturn.

If a chance line from the Via Lascivia cross the Life line (562), the lascivious practices of the subject will injure his health and cause illnesses. 

If after such cutting lines the Life line becomes defective or in any way impaired, the excesses will permanently injure the subject's health. If bars from the Via Lascivia cut the Mercury line (563), the excesses will injure the health and prospects of the subject. 

If a chance line from the Via Lascivia run to a dot in the Life line (564), the excesses will cause a severe illness at the age which the dot indicates.

If many lines from the Via Lascivia run across the Head line (565), the excesses will weaken and impair the brain, the subject will have many headaches.
- If a dot, deep bar, break, or cross occurs in the Head line after these cutting lines, the subject will have an attack of brain fever. 

If with such a combination a star be seen in the Head line he may become insane as the result of excesses. 

If a well-marked Via Lascivia be seen, with a strong line of Mars, all the lines deep and red, big Mount of Venus, thick third phalanges and short first phalanges, the subject will debauch himself continually, and if a thick or a clubbed thumb be added, will commit rape, brutal murder, arson, or any crime to accomplish his desires or to hide their commission. 

If the hand be not so animal, but the line of Mars sweeps across to the Mount of the Moon, and the Via Lascivia is present (566), the subject will drink heavily and commit intolerable excesses. If the Via Lascivia is present as a sister line to the Mercury line, it will repair that line wherever defective. 

A wavy line of Mercury with a Via Lascivia will not indicate the bad results from biliousness that would occur without it. A broken line of Mercury with a Via Lascivia will not indicate such serious stomach trouble.

If the Via Lascivia only runs part of the way alongside the Mercury line its strength will be exerted during the time it continues. Whatever period the Via Lascivia covers on the Mercury line will be correspondingly stronger as a result of the companionship. If a Mercury line runs to the Mount of Mercury, the subject will have good health and success. If the Via Lascivia runs beside this line this reading will be doubly certain. 

The Via Lascivia, it will thus appear, has a good side as well as a bad one. To determine which to attribute to a client, estimate him thoroughly Chirognomically. 

A strong Via Lascivia in a low, animal hand will be read as a menace, and danger of excess. The same line in a fine, high-minded type of hand should be read to indicate fine results. Thus Chirognomy and good judgment must again form the foundation upon which the reading of the line will rest, and with these guides you need never fail in accuracy.
