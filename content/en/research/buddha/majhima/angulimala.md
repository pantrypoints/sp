Buddha was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. 

Back then in King Pasenadi's realm, there was a bandit named Angulimala. 

He was brutal, bloody-handed, devoted to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. 

He turned villages into non-villages, towns into non-towns, settled countryside into unsettled countryside. 

Having repeatedly killed human beings, he wore a garland (mala) made of fingers (anguli).

The Buddha went into Savatthi for alms carrying his outer robe & bowl. 

<!-- Then the Buddha, early in the morning, having put on his robes and ,   -->

<!-- Having wandered for alms in Savatthi and returning from his alms round after his meal, he set his lodging in order. 

Carrying his robes & bowl, -->

He went along the road to where Angulimala was staying. 

Cowherds, shepherds, & farmers saw him going to where Angulimala was staying, and said to him:

{{< r a="People" >}}
Don't go along that road, for on that road is Angulimala. He is brutal, bloody-handed, devoted to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. 

He has turned villages into non-villages, towns into non-towns, settled countryside into unsettled countryside. 

Having repeatedly killed human beings, he wears a garland made of fingers. 

Groups of 10-40 men have gone along that road, and even they have fallen into Angulimala's hands.
{{< /r >}}


Yet, the Buddha kept going in silence.

<!-- A second time... A third time, cowherds, shepherds, & farmers said to the Buddha, "Don't go along that road, contemplative... Groups of ten, twenty, thirty, & forty men have gone along that road, and even they have fallen into Angulimala's hands." When this was said, the Buddha kept going in silence. -->

Then Angulimala saw the Buddha coming from afar and thought: 

{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
Amazing! Groups of 10-40 men have gone along this road, and even they have fallen into my hands. Yet now this contemplative comes attacking alone and without a companion. Why don't I kill him?
{{< /r >}}


So he took up his sword & shield, buckled on his bow & quiver, followed right behind the Buddha.

Then the Buddha willed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala, though running with all his might, could not catch up with the Buddha walking at normal pace. 

Then the thought occurred to Angulimala: 

{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
"Astounding! In the past I've chased & seized even a swift-running elephant, a swift-running horse, a swift-running chariot, a swift-running deer. But now, even though I'm running with all my might, I cannot catch up with this contemplative walking at normal pace."
{{< /r >}}


So he stopped and called out to the Buddha:

{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
Stop, contemplative! Stop!
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
I have stopped, Angulimala. You stop.
{{< /l >}}


Then the thought occurred to Angulimala:

{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
These Sakyan contemplatives are speakers of the truth, asserters of the truths. 

Yet this contemplative, even while walking, says, 'I have stopped, Angulimala. You stop.' Why don't I question him?
{{< /r >}}


So Angulimala the bandit asked the Buddha:

{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
While walking, you say 'I have stopped.'

But when I have stopped you say I haven't.

How have you stopped? How haven't I?"
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
I have stopped, Angulimala, once & for all, having cast off violence towards all living beings. You, though, are unrestrained towards beings. That's how I've stopped and you haven't.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Angulimala" >}}
At long last, a greatly revered great seer for my sake has come to the great forest.
Having heard your verse in line with the Dhamma, I will abandon evil.
{{< /r >}}


He hurled his sword & weapons over a cliff into a chasm, a pit.

Then the bandit paid homage to the feet of the One Well-gone, and right there requested the Going-forth.

<!-- The Awakened One, the compassionate great seer, the teacher of the world, along with its devas, said to him then: -->


{{< l a="Buddha" >}}
Come, bhikkhu.
{{< /l >}}


That in itself was bhikkhuhood for him.

Then the Buddha set out wandering toward Savatthi with Ven. Angulimala as his attendant monk.

After wandering by stages he reached Savatthi, and there he lived, near Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery.
