Its ruler wears a sarong and goes barefooted. The people cut their hair and also wear sarongs. 

Their native products are:

They calculate the value of their articles according to their equivalents in gold or silver, and then barter these articles at fixed
rates.

For example:
- 1 tong of samshu is equal to 1 tael of silver or 2 mace of gold
- 2 tong of rice are equal to 1 tael of silver
- 10 tong of rice is equal to 1 tael of gold

It sends yearly tribute to Sumatra.
