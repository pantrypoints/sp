Ctesophon is the greatest metropolis of the Arabs. 

It is 130 days land journey from Malopo, passing through 50 cities, 

Ctesophon is extremely powerful and large, and the number of soldiers and cavalry armed and equipped is very great. 

Their king is a direct successor of Mohammad, through 29 generations of 600-700 years. 

No Arab country has dared invade Ctesophon. 

<!-- The other lands of the Ta-shi have waged war against each other. But none have dared to invade this country. -->

When the king appears in public, he is covered by a black umbrella. Its handle is of gold and on the top is a jade lion with a golden moon on its back, shining like a star from afar. 

The towns and markets are cut by well-made streets. The people live lavishly.

There is a great store of precious things and of satins. There is little rice, fish, and vegetables. The people eat cakes, meat and sulo (butter).

Its products are:
- gold and silver
- engraved high quality glassware
- white yue-no cloth
- liquid storax

The people like to wear turbans and clothes of fine snow-white cotton. Every seven days, they cut their hair and nails, and five times daily they pray.

They are Muslims. The Caliphs are the descendants of the Prophet, and are foreigners visit to give them honor.

collecting his notes as falling between the years 1242 and
1258, the reign of the last Abbaside Caliph Musta'§im.
The only event Chau appears to have known of in the life of the Prophet is that mentioned
previously in the vaguest terms (supra, p. 117) and which corresponds roughly with A. D. 610, the
10 date of Mohammed's Call. Six hundred years counted from that date (or even for that matter from

on the top of the king's baldachin must have been a crescent, since, as an emblem, it would
15 otherwise have been taken for «a sun». The origin of the crescent among the Turks is wrapped in
mystery, and this passage, (written before the year 1178), seems to support A. Mailer's con-

When the lord of Pissilo shows himself in public, he is accompanied by more than 1,000 mounted retainers in full iron armor, the officers wearing coats of mail. He receives the orders of Iraq.

The people eat baked meal cakes, and mutton. Their almanac is correct in terms of the hot and cold seasons of the year. But they do not use the lunar calendar.
