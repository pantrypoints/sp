## 35. Cairo (Mulanpi)

Cario is west of Arabia which is separated by the Red Sea which has many countries. 

The biggest Arab ships go to Cairo.

This is reached from Topanti in Arabia after sailing for 100 days. A big ship has several thousand men. On board are stores of wine and provisions and weaving looms. 

Its exports are extraordinary:
- wheat grains 3 inches long
- melons six feet round, enough for a meal for 20-30 men. 
- pomegranates weigh 5 catties
- peaches weight 2 catties
- citrons that weight over twenty cattles and have leaves 3-4 feet long

Rice and wheat are kept in silos for tens of years without spoiling. 

Its local products are foreign sheep several feet high and have as big as a fan. In the spring-time they slit open their bellies and take out tens of catties of fat. They sew them up again, and the sheep live on. If the fat were not removed, the animal would swell up and die.

It can be reached from Aden Mulanpi by land in 200 days. During such time, humans and beasts must drink a lot to avoid dying of thirst.

There are also 10 tigers held with iron chains. 100 men watch them. 50 men hold the chains.

There are also an hundred club-bearers and thirty hawk-bearers.

1,000 horsemen surround and guard him and 300 body-slaves bear bucklers and swords.

Two men carry the king's weapons before him. 100  kettle-drummers follow him on horseback.

The whole pageant is very grand. 

The people live on on cakes and meat. They eat no rice. 

The weather is dry. 

The government extends over 16 provinces with a  circumference of over 60 stages. 

When rain falls, the people's farming is washed out and destroyed. 

Its river is very clear and has sweet water. Its source is unknown.

If there is a year of drought, the rivers of all other countries get low, and this river alone remains with the abundance of water for farming. 

This happens each year. Old men of 70-80 years cannot remember when it last rained.

An old tradition says that third generation of P'u-lo-hung when Shi-su a descendant in the
seized the government, he was afraid that the land would suffer from drought on account
of there being no rain. 

So he chose a tract of land near the river
he established 360 villages to grow wheat. In this way, the whole country would have food everyday. Each of these villages supplied it for one day so that these villages supplied food for a year. 

Furthermore, it has a city called Kieye on the bank of this river.


Every 2-3 years, an old man comes out of this river. His hair is black and short, his beard is hoary.

He sits on a rock in the water so that only half his body is visible. If he is thus seen
taking up water in his hands, washing his face and cutting his nails, the
strange being is recognized, and they go near him, kneel before him and
say:

This river has water-camels and water-horses who come up on the bank to eat the herbs. But they go back into the water as soon as they see a man.

## 37. Alexandria (Okonto)

This belongs to Egypt

According to tradition, in olden times, a stranger named Tsukoni built a great tower by the shore under which the earth was dug out and two rooms were made, well connected and very well secreted. 

In one vault was grain, in the other were arms. 

The tower was 200 chang high. Four horses abreast could ascend to 2/3 of its
height. In the centre of the building
was a great well connecting with the big river'.

To protect it from surprise, all of Alexandria guarded this tower.  In its upper and lower parts, 20,000 men could defend it or sally out to fight.

Its peak had a wondrous great mirror. It could detect foreign warships which made sudden attacks and warn the troops in time. 

In recent years, a foreigner asked to be given work in the guard-house of the tower to sprinkle and sweep. 

For years, no one suspected him. Suddenly, he stole the mirror one day and threw it into the sea and then fled.

to Egypt on a secret mission. Led into the presence of el-Walid, he said that he had fled from the

court of the Greek king to save his
life, and that he wished to become a mussulman. This he did,
he gained the confidence of the Caliph by disclosing to him the existence of
hidden treasures in Damascus and other places in Syria. One day he told el-Walid that when
Alexander had got possession of the property and the precious stones of Sheddad, son of Ad, or
10 of other Arab kings in Egypt and in Syria, he had built vaults and subterranean chambers,
covered over with vaults and arches. In these he put all his treasures,iingots, coin and precious
stones. Above these vaults he built the Pharos, which was not less than a thousand cubits high,
and on the top of it he placed a mirror and a guard. As soon as an enemy appeared in the
offing, the watchmen cried out to the neighbouring posts and, by means of signals, warned the

15 remotest ones. So the inhabitants were warned, ran to the defense of the city, and foiled the
enemy's attempt. On hearing this the Caliph sent the eunuch with some soldiers who pulled down
half of the tower and destroyed the mirror.
The people
of Alexandria and of the other cities
saw the ruse, and that they would be its victims, and the eunuch, fearing lest the Caliph should
soon hear of his perfidy, fled during the night and made oif on a ship which he had got ready in
20 case of need. Edrisi, I, 298 says a fire burnt on the Pharos continually, but he does not
mention the mirror. Cf. Yaliut, 263-4, who docs not believe this tale.
Conf. Abulfeda, II, Pt. 2, 144, who says the mirror was of airon of China». Leo Afri-
canus, Historic of Africa, III, 864 (Hakl. Soc. edit.), says it was a «steele-glasse by the hidden
vertue of which glasse as many ships as passed by while the glasse was uncovered should imme-
25 diately be set on
fire;
but the said glasse being broken by the Mahumetans, the secret vertue
thereof vanished)).
