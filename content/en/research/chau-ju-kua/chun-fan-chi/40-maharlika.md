## Territories 

### Manila 麻逸

The kingdom of Maharlika* (Ma-i) is north of Borneo. Its capital has over 1,000 families settled together along both banks of a creek [Pasig River]. 


{{< n n="Ma-i is a shortcut for May-nila which means 'having blue'. Nila is Sanskrit for blue. The color blue represents the caste of free citizens called Maharlika based on the precolonial caste system. It is improper to call the people of the Philippines as 'Manilans' just as we do not call all the French as 'Paris-ians'. Instead, we call it France as a reference to the Frankish people. We extend this to the Philippines to call the country as Maharlikans as a reference to the majority caste. This is supported by the Chinese characters for Ma-i 麻逸 where 逸 signifies moving freely." >}} 


<!-- </p><p>We apply the Maharlikan caste system as progressive taxation where the datus (ruling class and high net worth people) are taxed more and the maharlika (free citizens). The aliping namamahay (servants and low-class workers) and aliping sagigilid (criminals, vagrants) are not taxed. The description by Chau-ju-kua also explains why federalism is the natural system for Maharlika and also for Indonesia. The unitary system can work with the Arab nations since Islam and the Persian system already has been in force for a long time.</p><p>The caste system manifests in modern countries as the rich caste versus the poor caste. We explain the current caste system in the Philippines at the bottom</p> -->



The Maharlikans cover themselves with a sheet of cotton cloth or hide the lower part of the body with a sarong. There are bronze images of gods of unknown origin, scattered about in the grassy wilderness.

Theft is rare. 
<!-- Pirates seldom come to this country. -->

When merchant ships arrive in their territory, they enter the harbor and anchor before the government market. 

<!-- When trading ships enter the bay, they stop in front of the officials' place which is the place for bartering.   -->
- This “government market” is their place for bartering. 

Officials board the ships and mingle freely with the merchants. 

The chiefs are fond of white umbrellas. This is why the traders offer them as gifts.

Their trading customs are as follows.

Local traders gather in crowds, and freely step over the bamboo fences to take goods away. 

At first, this seems incomprehensible. But afterwards, the merchants slowly identify who carried off which item, and nothing is ever lost. 

These traders then carry the goods to other islands for trade. 

They typically return only around the eighth or ninth month.

They repay the ship merchants with what they earned. 

Some, however, do not return by the expected time. Thus, ships that trade in Maharlika are the last to come home.

<!-- After a ship has been boarded, the natives mix freely with the ship's crew.  -->

<!-- The Maharlikan traders assemble in crowds and carry the goods away with them in baskets.  -->

<!-- Even if the foreign merchants do not know the Maharlikan traders and cannot distinguish them, there will be no loss. -->

<!--  if one initially does not know them, and can but slowly distinguish the men who
there will yet be no loss. --> 

<!-- - The native traders will bring those goods to other islands for barter. It will take 8-9 months* for them to return.
- They then repay the foreign merchants with what they had obtained for the goods.
- Some, however, do not return within the proper time**. This delay is why vessels trading with Maharlika are the last to return home. -->

{{< n n="The foreign merchants would leave a representative or envoy behind to make sure that the goods would be returned on the next visit." >}}

{{< n n="Here, Filipino time is consistent with Maharlikan time. This is why 'truth' (katotohanan) is the first constitutional virtue suggested" >}}


The following places belong to Maharlika:

- Visayas
- Babuyan (Paipuyen) 
- Mindanao (Pulilu)
- Luzon
- Butuan (Likintung or Dongliuxin)
- Bulacan (Lihan)


### Maharlikan Exports

![Beeswax](https://www.buzzaboutbees.net/images/sticks-of-natural-beeswax.jpg)

Their exports are:

- yellow beeswax
- cotton cloth
- pearls
- tortoise-shell
- medicinal betel-nuts*
- yuta cloth (udapu)

{{< n n="This is clear proof of the influence of the babaylans which were the feminine priest caste that also concocted herbal medicine. It shows that the Babaylan caste had export potential which contributed to Maharlika's GDP. This is why Maharlikanism advocates the advancement of Maharlikan herbal medicines to catch up with Indian Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine" >}}



#### Maharlikan Imports

Foreign merchants barter for these with:

- porcelain vessels
- trade-gold
- iron censers or cauldrons
- lead for bullets
- multicolored glass beads
- iron needles*
- similar goods

{{< n n="This is consistent with the observation of Pigafetta and Jagor that Maharlikan manufacturing was very weak. This is why Talino is also an important constitutional virtue" >}}


<!-- Notes.

1) According to Blumentritt, Versuch einer Ethnographie der Philippinen, 65. Mait, meaning othe country of the Blacks», was tte name of the island of Mindoro. See B. Laufcr, 252. Considering that our author says
Relations of the Chinese to the Philippine Islands, 251 that the Babuyan islands off the N. coast of Luzon, and Polillo island off the E. coast are a part of Ma-i, it seems fair to assume that the latter name is used by him as applying to Mindoro and 25 Luzon at all events, if not to the whole Philippine group. The name of Ma-i was first heard of in China in A. D. 982 when some traders from that country brought valuable merchandise to Canton. Hervey St. Denis, Ethnographie, II, 502.

2) When Magellan discovered the Philippines, he found the people worshipping Referring to Qebu, Pigafetta says= «These idols are made idols. of wood, they are concave or hollowed 30 out behind, and the feet turned upwards; they have a large face, with four large teeth like those of a wild boar, and they are all painted)). Eirst The images Voyage round the World, (Hakl. Soc. edit.), 96. referred to by our author were probably of a like description. In the seventeenth century Spanish writers mention the idols of the Negritos of the Philippines and their many gods. A. Reed, Negritos of Zambales, 26.

3) On Babuyan islands, off the N. coast of E. coast of Luzon. The other three names are not be Lingayen, an important port on the W. coast of Luzon, Liu-sin San-sii, see infra, p. 161. Pai-p'u-yen are the Luzon.

On the term «trade-gold)), see supra p. 82. -->



## Visayas (41: San-yu 三嶼) 

The Visayas* (Sanyu or Three Islands) belong to Maharlika:

- Panay-Cebu (Jiamayen) 
- Palawan 
- Leyte-Samar (Pakinung or Bajinong)

{{< n n="This proves that Visayas and Sri Vijaya do not mean 'victory'. Instead, vija means 3 or tiga. In this way, Visayas means 3 islands just as Sri Vijaya (Sanfotsi) means 3 nations as Sumatran, Malay, and Southern Thai" >}}


Each has its own tribes scattered over the islands. Together these three islands are called San-yu [Visa-yas].

When ships arrive there, the natives come out to trade with them.

Their local customs are about the same as those of Maharlika. Each settlement contains over a thousand households.

The land is full of steep hills and jagged peaks that rise like walls. They build houses of woven thatch, clinging to lofty and dangerous spots.


There are no springs in the mountains. And so the women carry 2-3 jars suspended from head-straps, fetching water from streams, climbing as though on level ground.



In the remotest valleys, there lives another tribe called Aetas (Hai-tan) who are small, with round yellow eyes and curly hair and exposed teeth.

They nest in treetops. Sometimes, parties of 3-5 lurk in the jungle and shoot arrows on passers-by without being seen. Many have fallen victims to them. 

When given a porcelain bowl, they eagerly pick it up and leap away joyfully.

![Aeta archer](https://aetaarchery.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/aeta-archer-2.jpg)


When merchants arrive at a settlement, they do not dare go ashore immediately.

First, they anchor mid-stream and beat drums to summon the traders.

The people then race out in small boats, bringing cotton cloth, yellow wax, foreign cloth, and coconut mats to trade. 

If the prices cannot be settled, the local chiefs come to negotiate.

Merchants present them with silk umbrellas, porcelain, and rattan baskets, and they leave 1-2 men as hostages. 

Only then do they disembark for trade. Once trading ends, the hostages are returned. Ships usually stay no more than 3-4 days before moving on.

The various tribes surrounding the San-yu islands are not under a single authority.

Their mountains lean toward the northeast. When the south wind blows, the waters crash into the mountains with violent waves, making anchorage impossible. 

This is why ships trading with San-yu typically set sail home in the 4th or 5th month.

Goods used for barter include porcelain, black silk, patterned silk, multicolored beads, lead net-weights, and white tin.


#### Visayan Exports

Foreign traders arrive by announcing their presence by beating drums then moor their ships midstream. The Visayans race to the ship in small boats, carrying the following for barter:
- cotton
- yellow wax
- native cloth
- coconut-heart mats

If the prices of goods cannot be agreed upon, the chief of the local traders must go in person, in order to come to an understanding. 

The natives are then offered gifts of:
- silk umbrellas
- porcelain
- rattan baskets

The foreign merchants hold one or two natives as hostages on board while they go on shore to trade. They return those hostages after trading is finished.

A ship will only anchor for 3-4 days and then move to another place. The Visayan settlements are along the coast are not connected by common jurisdiction. They are are all independent. 

The coast faces south-west. During the south-west monsoon, ships are unable to anchor there. This is why the traders to the Visayas do the return trip in May or June. 

#### Visayan Imports

The following are exchanged in barter:

- porcelain
- black damask
- various other silks
- beads of all colors
- leaden sinkers for nets
- tin 


### Mindanao

Mindanao (Pulilu) is connected with the Visayas, but its settlements are somewhat more prosperous. 

But most of the people are of a cruel disposition and fond of attacking and robbing*. 

{{< n n="This manifests as the 'rido' clan-war culture and piracy in Sulu. A suggestion to soften such a culture is to overwhelm them with effeminate KPop" >}}


The sea around them contains stones called lu-gu, sharp as thorns or dried wooden barbs, sharper than swords or halberds. 

<!-- The sea thereabout is full of bare ribs of rock with jagged teeth like blasted trees, their points and edges sharper than swords and lances.  -->

Ships passing nearby must twist and turn to avoid them.

From here come coral-trees, the tsinglangkan, and the shanhu varieties. But they are very difficult to get. 

Their local customs and trade practices are the same as the Visayas.


<!-- Notes. Kia-ma-yen is probably CalamiAn, the largest pf the Calamianes group of islands, N. E.
of Palawan; Pa-lau-yu may be Palawan, and Pa-ki-nung, it would seem, should be Busuanga Island.
Laufer, op. sup. cit., 252, note 1, identifies Pa-lau-yu with Penon de Cor6n, near the E. end of
Busuanga, and famous as one of the places where edible bird's nests are gathered.

2) The Aeta {Aigta or Inagta, appears to be the original form of the word, de Quatre-fages, Distribution des Negritos,
6), the negrito aboriginals of the Philippines; they still occupy the most mountainous and inaccessible parts of Luzon.  -->
