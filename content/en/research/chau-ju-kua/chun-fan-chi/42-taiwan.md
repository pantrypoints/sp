## 30. Northern Taiwan

Northern Taiwan (Liukiu) is 5-6 days sail east of Canton. 

The king's family name is Huan-ssi. But the natives call him Kolau. 

His lives in Polotantung. It has a threefold mound and a palisade surrounded by running water and protected by thorn hedges, and the eaves of the palace building have many figures of birds and beasts carved upon them.


Both sexes bind their hair with white hempen cord and coil it up in a knot at the back of the head. 

They make clothes of different patterns from hempen cloth and (ornamented with) feathers.

They have no noteworthy products. The people are given to robbery. This is why traders do not go there. Sometimes, they gather yellow wax, native gold, buffalo tails and jerked leopard meat to the Visayas for sale. By its side are Southern Taiwan and Tanmayen.
