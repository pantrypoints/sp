## 1. CAMPHOR

Nau-tzi, or camphor, comes from Brunei <!-- called according to some Fo-ni --> and Pin-su.

It is wrongly said to come from Palembang, Sumatra because that place is a hub for foreign trade. 

The camphor-tree is like the pine-tree, growing in the remotest hills and valleys.

As long as the branches and trunk continue unhurt, the tree will contain the gum even for hundreds and thousands of years. 

Otherwise, it will evaporate.


The natives go in teams of several tens of men when they gather camphor from the hills. They are provided with clothes made of tree bark and and with supplies of sago for food.

They go in different directions. Whenever they find any camphor-trees, they fell them with hatchets, as many as ten or more.

They cut these lengthwise. Each one then cut these into boards. They notch these along the sides and cross-wise to produce chinks. A wedge is forced into them to colect the camphor. 

The camphor which forms crystals is called plum flower camphor because it resembles the plum flower. 

An inferior quality is called gold foot camphor. 

Broken bits are called rice camphor. With splinters, it is called grey camphor.

After all the camphor has been removed from the wood, it is called camphor chips. 


Nowadays people break these chips into small bits and mix them with sawdust. They put it in a porcelain vessel, hermetically sealed by another
vessel. When baked in hot ashes, the vapour formed by the mixture condenses and forms lumps called collected camphor.
It is used for women's head ornaments.

Camphor oil is an oily kind of camphor with a pungent aroma. It is used to moisten incense, or mixing with oil.

Chang {^m)- Nan-yufe-pi-ki (of the eighteenth century), 5,io, says that lung-nau (baroos camphor)
5 comes from Fo-ta-ni ('^
;^ Patani?). The Cantonese mix it with chang-nau (i. e., camphor
from the Laurus camphora) which comes from Shau-chou (^^
in Kuang-tung); hence its
name of shau-naun. In northern China camphor is usually called ch'au-nau (iM B^) from Ch'au-
ch6u, also in Kuang-tung, and not far distant from Shau-chou. This latter name ck'.au-nau must
be the correct form. See also Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, 346 (J. 0. B. K. A. S., XXV).
10 Linschoten, Voyage to the East Indies, II, 118 (Hakl. Soc. edit.) remarks that one pound of
Borneo camphor was worth one hundred pounds of Chin-cheu (i. e., Chinese) camphor.
4) Marsden, op. cit, 123 says= «The camphire oil is a valuable domestic medicine, and
much used by the Sumatrans
It is rather a liquid and volatile resin, distilling from one
species of the camphire tree, without any oleaginous quality».
15
Our author states (supra, p. 67) that camphor was also a product of Tan-ma-ling, of Java
(p. 77), and of Ling-ya-ssi-kia (p. 68) Chou K'ii-fei adds Chu-lien. See supra, p, 100, n. -->


## 2. FRANKINCENSE

Ju-hiang (milk incense), or hun-lu-hiang comes from the from the depths of the remotest mountain Valleys of 3 Arab countries:
- Ma-lo-pa
- Shi-ho
- Nu-fa, 

The tree which yields this drug may be compared to the sung or pine tree. 

Its trunk is notched with a hatchet, upon which the resin flows out. 

It hardens into incense and gathered and made into lumps. It is transported on elephants towards the Arab coast and are bartered in Sumatra. This is why it is commonly collected in Sumatra.

The Customs authorities in Sumatra classify it into 13, based on the strength of its fragrance. 

1. Kien-hiang or picked incense is the very best kind. It is round and of the size of the end of a finger. It is commonly called ti-ju or dripping milk
2. Ping-ju or potted milk is the second quality. Its colour is inferior to that of the picked incense. It is placed in pots. 
3-5. The ping-hiang variety has 3 grades:
  - superior
  - medium
  - inferior
6-8. Tai-hiang or bag incense is put in bags and has 3 grades too
9. The ju-ta kind is mixed with gravel
10. Hei-ta is black. 
11. Shu-shi hei-ta is water-damaged incense with its aroma turned, and colour spoiled while on board the ship.
12. Cho-siau is mixed incense of various qualities and consisting of broken pieces. 
13. Chan-mo powder is cho-siau passed through a sieve and made into dust.

## 5. SWEET BENZOIN

The best kin-yen-hiang comes from Cambodia. 

The Arab kind is of inferior quality.

People think that this comes from Sumatra <!-- San-fo-ts'i --> when it is really imported from there from Arabia and then into China. 

This incense is the juice of a tree. It has different kinds:
- a black one
- a pale yellow one
- a snow-white one, on being broken open, which is the best
- one with gravel, as the inferior kind

Its aroma is so strong that it may be
