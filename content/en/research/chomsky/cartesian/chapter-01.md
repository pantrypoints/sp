Descartes makes only scant reference to language in his writings. 

<!-- Yet certain observations about the nature of language play a significant role in the formulation of his general point of view. -->

He did a careful and intensive study of the limits of mechanical explanation. This carried him beyond physics to physiology and psychology.

He became convinced that an animal is an automaton.5

This led to an important and influential system of speculative physiology. 

He concluded that man has unique abilities that cannot be accounted for on purely mechanistic grounds, though human bodily function and behavior is explained mechanistically. 

The essential difference between man and animal is exhibited most clearly by human language. Man can form new statements which express new thoughts and which are appropriate to new situations. 

He thinks that we can think of a machine that can utters words. But it is not conceivable that such a machine should produce different arrangements of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer  as the dullest of men can do. (CSM I, 39)6

<!-- , and even words which correspond to bodily actions causing a change in its organs (for instance, if you touch it in one place it asks what you want of it; if you touch it in another place it cries out that you are hurting it, and so on). -->


This ability to use language must not be confused with “natural movements which express passions and which can be imitated by machines as well as by animals.” 

The crucial difference is that automata “could never use words or put together other signs as we do in order to declare our thoughts for others.”

This is a specific human ability, independent of intelligence. 

Thus, there are no men so dull-witted or stupid who cannot arrange words together in order to make their thoughts understood.

But no animal can do this. (CSM I, 39–40)

 <!-- whereas there is no other animal, however perfect and well endowed it may be, that can do the same. -->

This difference is not caused by peripheral physiological differences. Animals are not incapable of language because they lack the necessary organs.

Magpies and parrots can utter words, yet they cannot speak as we do. They cannot show that they are thinking what they are saying.

On the other hand, men born deaf and dumb can invent their own signs to make themselves understood*.

<!-- In short, then, man has a species-specific capacity, a  which cannot be attributed to peripheral organs or related to general intelligence7 and which manifests itself in what we may refer to as the -->

Therefore, man has unique type of intellectual organization that allows the “creative aspect” of ordinary language use.

 <!-- – its property being both unbounded in scope and stimulus-free.  -->

Thus Descartes maintains that human language is the effect of the free expression of thought.

 <!-- or for appropriate response in any new context and is undetermined by any fixed association of utterances to external stimuli or physiological states (identifiable in any noncircular fashion).8  -->

<!-- Arguing from the presumed impossibility of a mechanistic explanation for the creative aspect of normal use of language, -->

This makes Descartes conclude that the human mind is different from those of animals.
- The mind is a substance whose essence is thought.


<!-- in addition to body it is necessary to attribute mind – a substance whose essence
is thought – to other humans.  -->

<!-- From the arguments that he offers for the association of mind to bodies that “bear a resemblance” to his, it seems clear that the postulated -->

This substance is the “creative principle” alongside the “mechanical principle” that accounts for bodily function. 
- Human reason “is a universal instrument which can serve for all contingencies” 
- Whereas the organs of an animal or machine “need some special adaptation for any particular action.”9

<!-- The crucial role of language in Descartes’s argument is brought out still more clearly in his subsequent correspondence.  -->

In Descartes' letter to the Marquis of Newcastle (1646), he asserts that our external actions show that our body contains a soul with thoughts.

 <!-- – with the exception of spoken words or other signs having reference to particular topics without expressing any passion.”10 -->

The final condition is added to exclude “cries of joy or sadness and the like” as well as “whatever can be taught by training to animals.” (CSMK, 303)11 

He writes that:
- all men use human language to express his thoughts
- no animal can use a sign to express to other animals*
  - He uses this as proof that animals have no thoughts 

{{< n n="Animals communicate by Physiognomy, as the use of facial expressions, because their 5th chakra is undeveloped">}}

 <!-- goes on, then, to repeat the arguments in the Discourse on the Method, emphasizing once again that there is  -->

<!-- no man so imperfect as not to use language for the  and no “animal so perfect as to use a sign to make
other animals understand something which bore no relation to its passions”;  -->

<!-- and, once again, pointing to the very perfection of animal instinct as an indication of lack of thought and as a proof that animals are mere automata. -->

This is written in a 1649 letter to Henry More:

I think that animals lack thought because no animal has used real speech using a word or sign that relates to thought alone and not to natural impulse.

<!-- Within a single species some of them are more perfect than others, as humans are too.

This can be seen in horses and dogs, some of which learn what they are taught much better than others; and all animals easily communicate to us, by voice or bodily movement, their natural impulses of anger, fear, hunger and so on.

Yet in spite of all these facts, it has never been observed that any
 -->
 <!-- Such speech is the only certain sign of thought hidden in a body. -->

All human beings use words or signs no matter how stupid and insane they may be.

<!-- , even though they may have no tongue and organs of voice; but no animals do. Consequently this can be taken as a real specific difference between humans and animals. (CSMK, 366)12,13 -->




Descartes assigns mind only to humans because of:
- the diversity of human behavior
- its appropriateness to new situations
- man’s capacity to innovate
  - This  is shown by the creative aspect of language use

He regards this capacity as beyond the limitations of any imaginable mechanism. 

Thus a proper psychology requires a “creative principle” alongside the “mechanical principle” that accounts for:
- all other aspects of the inanimate and animate world and
- a significant range of human actions and “passions”.

<!-- Descartes’s observations on language in relation to the problem of mechanistic explanation were elaborated in an  
.14 --> 

In an interesting study by Cordemoy, Descartes wanted to know if there were other minds other than the human. 

<!-- His problem in this study is to determine whether it is necessary to assume the existence of other minds.15  -->

<!-- A great deal of the complexity of human behavior is irrelevant to demonstrating that other persons are not mere automata, since it can be explained on hypothetical physiological terms, in terms of reflex and tropism. 

Limitations of such explanations are suggested by the fact that “they confidently approach something that will destroy them, and abandon what could save them” (p. 7). 

This suggests that their actions are governed by a will, like his own. -->

His best evidence is from speech.

<!-- , by the connection I find among the words I constantly hear them utter ... -->

<!-- For although I readily conceive that a mere machine could utter some words, I know at the same time that if there was a particular order among the springs that distribute the wind or open the pipes from which the sounds came then they could never change it; so that as soon as the first sound is heard, those which usually follow it will also necessarily be heard, provided that the machine does not lack wind – whereas the words I hear uttered by bodies constructed like mine almost never follow the same sequence. 

These words are the same as those I would use to explain my thoughts to other subjects capable of conceiving them. 

Finally, the more I attend to the effect produced by my words when I utter them before these bodies, the more it seems they are understood, and the words they utter correspond so perfectly to the sense of my words that there is no reason to doubt that a soul produces in them what my soul produces in me. (pp. 8–10) -->

Cordemoy argues that there can be no mechanistic explanation for the novelty, coherence, and relevance of normal speech.*

{{< n n="The mechanistic explanation for human speech is given by AI as large language models" >}} 

<!-- He emphasizes, however, that care must be exercised in using ability to speak as evidence for the inadequacy of mechanistic explanation. 

The fact that articulate sounds are produced or that utterances can be imitated in itself proves nothing, as this can be explained in mechanical terms. 

Nor is it of any relevance that “natural signs” may be produced that express internal states or that specific signs may be produced that are contingent on the presence of external stimuli. It is only the
ability to innovate, and to do so in a way which is appropriate to novel situations
and which yields coherent discourse, that provides crucial evidence. “To speak
is not to repeat the same words that one has heard, but... to utter different words
in response to those” (p. 19). 

To show that other persons are not automata, one must provide evidence that their speech manifests this creative aspect, that it is appropriate to whatever may be said by the “experimenter”; “... if I find, by all the observations I can make, that they use language [La Parole] as I do, then I will have an infallible reason to believe that they have a soul as I do” (p. 21).
Possible types of experiment are then outlined. 

For example, one can construct new “conventional signs” [signes d’institution]:
I see that I can agree with others that what ordinarily signifies one thing will signify
another, and that this has the result that only those with whom I make this agreement
seem to understand what I am thinking. (pp. 22–23)

Similarly, evidence is provided when I see that these bodies produce signs that bear no relation to their present state or to
their preservation; when I see that these signs match those which I would produce to
express my thoughts; when I see that they give me ideas which I did not have previously
and which refer to things that I already had in mind; and finally when I see a close
correlation between their signs and mine; (pp. 28–29)
or by behavior that indicates “that they intended to deceive me” (pp. 30–31).
Under such circumstances, when many experiments of this sort have succeeded,
“it will not be reasonable for me to believe that they are not like me” (p. 29) -->


He emphasizes the innovative aspect of intelligent performance. 

<!-- 
Thus, ... the new thoughts that come through our conversations with other men are a sure sign to all of us that they have a mind like ours; (p. 185)
... our whole reason for believing that there are minds united with the bodies of men who speak to us is that they often give us new thoughts that we did not have, or they oblige us to change the thoughts that we did have... (p. 187) -->

Cordemoy consistently maintains that the “experiments” that reveal the limitations of mechanical explanation are those which involve the use of language.

<!-- – in particular, what we have called its creative aspect. -->

Cordemoy is working completely within the framework of Cartesian assumptions.
