The important things are:
- the emphasis on the creative aspect of language use
- the fundamental distinction between human language and the purely functional and stimulus-bound animal communication

<!-- rather than the Cartesian attempts to account for human abilities.  -->

<!-- Subsequent discussion rarely attempts to meet the Cartesian arguments regarding the limitations of mechanical explanation. -->

Descartes argued that there must be a “thinking substance” to account for the facts that he cites. 

This proposal is countered by the claim that a more complex organization of the body can account for human abilities.

But no serious attempt is made to show how this might be possible. Descartes, Cordemoy, and others tried to show how animal behavior and human bodily functions can be explained as physical organization. 

La Mettrie, for example, holds that man is simply the most complex of machines. 

<!-- “He is to the ape and the cleverest of animals what the Huyghen’s planetary clock is to one of Julien Leroy’s  watches” (p. 34; MaM, p. 140).16 There is, in his opinion, no difficulty in accounting for thought on mechanical principles. “I believe thought to be so little incompatible with organised matter, that it seems to be one of its properties, like electricity, motive power, impenetrability, extension, etc.” (p. 35; MaM, pp. 143–144). -->

There should be no obstacle in principle to teaching an ape to speak. It is only “a defect in the speech organs” that stands in
the way, and this can be overcome by proper training (p. 11; MaM, p. 100). 

<!-- “I hardly doubt at all that if this animal were perfectly trained, we would succeed in teaching him he might at last be taught to utter sounds and consequently to learn a language.  -->

<!-- Then he would no longer be a wild man, nor an imperfect man, but a perfect man, a little man of the town” (p. 12; MaM, p. 103). -->

Similarly, a talking machine is not beyond imagination. 

<!-- “If it took Vaucanson more artistry to make his flautist than his duck, he would have needed even more to make a speaking machine, which can no longer be considered impossible ...” (p. 34; MaM, pp. 140–141).

Several years before the publication of L’Homme Machine, in a slight and presumably only semi-serious work,  -->

Bougeant produced one of the very few attempts to refute explicitly the Cartesian argument that human and animal language differ fundamentally 17.

But it actually reaffirms the Cartesian position.

 <!-- regarding human and animal language. -->

He claims that “animals speak and understand each other just as well as we do, and sometimes better”. They:
- can be trained to respond to signals
- exhibit their “various feelings” by external signs
- can work in cooperation.

 <!-- (for example, beavers, to whom he ascribes a language that has much in common with those “language games” that Wittgenstein regards as “primitive forms” of human language). -->

However, he recognizes that:
- “the language of animals is entirely limited to expressing limited feelings.

 <!-- of their passions, which may all be reduced to a small number” (p. 152).  -->

<!-- “It is necessary that they always repeat the same expression, and that this repetition last as long as the object occupies their attention” (p. 123).  -->

They have no “abstract or metaphysical ideas”:

They have only direct cognitions that are completely limited to the material objects that strike their senses. 

Man is infinitely superior in his language, as in his ideas, being incapable of expressing himself without composing his speech of proper names and relative terms, which determine its sense and application. (p. 154)

Animals have only names for various “passions that they feel” (p. 155). They cannot produce “a phrase which is personalized and composite [personifiée et composée] as we do” (p. 156):

Why has nature given animals the faculty of speech? 

<!-- Solely so they can express to each other their desires and feelings, and thereby satisfy their needs and whatever may be necessary for their preservation. 

I know that language in general has quite a different objective, which is to express ideas, cognitions, reflections, reasonings.  -->

Nature has endowed animals with knowledge only of what is useful to them or necessary for the survival of the species and of individuals. Consequently, they have:
- no abstract ideas
- no metaphysical reasoning
- no enquiry or curiosity about the objects around them
- no knowledge except how to conduct themselves, keep well, avoid whatever may harm them, and acquire goods. 

<!-- Nor has one ever seen them engaged in public discussion, or argument about causes and effects. They know only the life of an animal. (pp. 99–100) -->

In short, animal “language” remains completely within the bounds of mechanical explanation as this was conceived by Descartes and Cordemoy.

Neither La Mettrie nor Bougeant comes to grips with the problem raised by Descartes – the problem posed by the creative aspect of language use.

Human language is free from control by identifiable external stimuli or internal physiological states. And so it can serve as a general instrument of thought and self-expression rather than merely as a communicative device of report, request, or command.18 

<!-- Modern attempts to deal with the problem of intelligent behavior are hardly more satisfactory.  -->

Ryle, in his critique of “Descartes’s myth”19 simply avoids the issue entirely. 

He claims that the Cartesians should have been “asking by what criteria intelligent behavior is actually distinguished from non-intelligent behavior” (p. 21) rather than seeking an explanation for the former. 

Properly understood, these are not mutually exclusive alternatives. 

The criteria that Ryle discusses differ little, in principle, from Cordemoy’s proposed “experiments”.

Ryle is content simply to cite the fact that “intelligent behavior” has certain properties.20 But the Cartesians were concerned with the problem of accounting for such behavior without being able to provide an explanation in mechanical terms.

<!-- It can hardly be claimed that we have advanced significantly beyond the seventeenth century in determining the characteristics of intelligent behavior, the means by which it is acquired, the principles that govern it, or the nature of the structures that underlie it. 

One may choose to ignore these problems, but no coherent argument has been offered that suggests that they are either unreal or beyond investigation. -->

Modern linguistics has also failed to deal with the Cartesian observations regarding human language in any serious way. 

Bloomfield, for example, observes that in a natural language “the possibilities of combination are practically infinite,” so that there is no hope of accounting for language use on the basis of repetition or listing.

But he has nothing further to say about the problem beyond the remark that the speaker utters new forms “on the analogy of similar forms which he has heard.”21 

Similarly, Hockett attributes innovation completely to “analogy.”22 

Similar remarks can be found in Paul, Saussure, Jespersen, and many others. 

<!-- To attribute the creative aspect of language use to “analogy” or “grammatical patterns” is to use these terms in a completely metaphorical way, with no clear sense and with no relation to the technical usage of linguistic theory. 

It is no less empty than Ryle’s description of intelligent behavior as an exercise of “powers” and “dispositions” of some mysterious sort, or the attempt to account for the normal, creative use of language in terms of “generalization” or “habit” or “conditioning.” 

A description in these terms is incorrect if the terms have anything like their technical meanings, and highly misleading otherwise, in so far as it suggests that the capacities in question can somehow be accounted for as just a “more complicated case” of something reasonably well understood. -->

<!-- We have seen that the Cartesian view, as expressed by Descartes and Cordemoy as well as by such professed anti-Cartesians as Bougeant, is that in its normal use, 

Human language is free from stimulus control and does not serve a merely communicative function, but is rather an instrument for the free expression of thought and for appropriate response to new situations.23 

These observations concerning what we have been calling the creative aspect of language use are elaborated in several ways in the eighteenth and early 19th centuries, as we shall see directly. At the same time,  -->
