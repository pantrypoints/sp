The study of the creative aspect of language-use develops from the assumption that linguistic and mental processes are virtually identical

Language provides the primary means for:
- free expression of thought and feeling
- the functioning of the creative imagination. 

Similarly, much of the substantive discussion of grammar, throughout the development of what we have been calling “Cartesian linguistics,” derives from this assumption.

The Port-Royal Grammar, for example, begins the discussion of syntax with the observation that there are “three operations of our minds: conceiving, judging, and reasoning” (p. 27), of which the third is irrelevant to grammar (it is taken up in the Port-Royal Logic, which appeared two years later, in 1662).

From the manner in which concepts are combined in judgments, the Grammar deduces what it takes to be the general form of any possible grammar, and it proceeds to elaborate this universal underlying structure from a consideration of “the natural manner in which we express our thoughts” (p. 30).64 Most sub- sequent attempts to develop a schema of universal grammar proceed along the same lines.

James Harris’s Hermes, which does not bear the imprint of the Port-Royal
Grammar to the extent usual in eighteenth-century work, also reasons from the
structure of mental processes to the structure of language, but in a somewhat
different way. In general, he maintains, when a man speaks, “his Speech or
Discourse is a publishing of some Energie or Motion of his soul” (p. 223).65 

The “powers of the soul” are of two general types: perception (involving the senses and the intellect) and volition (the will, passions, appetites –” all that moves to Action whether rational or irrational” (p. 224). It follows that there are two kinds of linguistic acts: to assert, that is, “to publish some Perception either of the Senses or the Intellect”; or to “publish volitions,” that is, to interrogate, com- mand, pray, or wish (p. 224). 

The first type of sentence serves “to declare ourselves to others”; the second, to induce others to fulfill a need. Continuing in this way, we can analyze the volitional sentences in terms of whether the need is “to have some perception informed” or “some volition gratified” (the interrogative and requisitive modes, respectively); the requisitive is further analyzed as imperative or precative, depending on whether the sentence is addressed to inferiors or non-inferiors). Since both interrogatives and requisitives serve “to answer to a need,” both types “require a return” – a return in words or deeds, to the requisitive, and in words alone, to the interrogative (p. 293f.).66 Thus the framework for the analysis of types of sentences is provided by a certain analysis of mental processes.

Pursuing the fundamental distinction between body and mind, Cartesian linguistics characteristically assumes that language has two aspects. In partic- ular, one may study a linguistic sign from the point of view of the sounds that constitute it and the characters that represent these signs or from the point of view of their “signification,” that is, “the manner in which men use them for signifying their thoughts” (Port-Royal Grammar, p. 41). 

Cordemoy announces his goal in similar terms: “in this discourse I make a precise survey of everything that speech [la Parole] derives from the soul and everything it borrows from the body” (Discours physique de la parole, Preface). Similarly, Lamy begins his rhetoric by distinguishing between “the soul of words” (that is, “their mental [spiritual] aspect,” “what is particular to us” – the capacity of expressing “our ideas”) from “their body” – “their corporeal aspect,” “what the birds that imitate the voices of men have in common with us,” namely, “the sounds, which are signs of their ideas” (De L’art de parler).

In short, language has an inner and an outer aspect. A sentence can be studied
from the point of view of how it expresses a thought or from the point of view of
its physical shape, that is, from the point of view of either semantic interpreta-
tion or phonetic interpretation.

Using some recent terminology, we can distinguish the “deep structure” of a sentence from its “surface structure.” The former is the underlying abstract struc- ture that determines its semantic interpretation; the latter, the superficial organiza- tion of units which determines the phonetic interpretation and which relates to the physical form of the actual utterance, to its perceived or intended form. In these terms, we can formulate a second fundamental conclusion of Cartesian linguistics, namely, that deep and surface structures need not be identical. The underlying organization of a sentence relevant to semantic interpretation is not necessarily revealed by the actual arrangement and phrasing of its given components.

This point is brought out with particular clarity in the Port-Royal Grammar, in which a Cartesian approach to language is developed for the first time, with considerable insight and subtlety.67 The principal form of thought (but not the only one – cf. p. 79 below) is the judgment, in which something is affirmed of something else. Its linguistic expression is the proposition, the two terms of which are the “subject, which is that of which one affirms” and the “predicate, which is that which is predicated” (p. 29; PRG 67). The subject and the attribute may be simple, as in “Earth is round”, or complex [composé], as in “An able magistrate is a man useful to the republic” or “Invisible God created the visible world.” Furthermore, in such cases as these, the propositions contain, at least in our mind, several judgments, from which one can make as many propositions.

Thus, for example, when I say “Invisible God created the visible world” 3 judgments that pass through my mind are included in this proposition. For I judge: 

(1) that God is invisible;
(2) that He created the world;
(3) that the world is visible;

Of these three propositions, the second is the principal and essential one of the
original proposition. But the first and the third are only subordinate, and comprise only
part of the principal proposition – the first composing its subject, the third its predicate.

In other words, the deep structure underlying the proposition “Invisible God
created the visible world” consists of three abstract propositions, each express-
ing a certain simple judgment, although its surface form expresses only the
subject-attribute structure. Of course, this deep structure is implicit only; it is not
expressed but is only represented in the mind:
Now these subordinate propositions are often in our mind, without being expressed in
words, as in the example cited [viz. “Invisible God created the visible world”]. 

It is sometimes possible to express the deep structure in a more explicit way, in
the surface form, “as when I reduce the above example to these terms: ‘God
WHO is invisible created the world WHICH is visible’” (pp. 68–69; PRG 100).
But it constitutes an underlying mental reality – a mental accompaniment to the
utterance – whether or not the surface form of the utterance that is produced
corresponds to it in a simple, point-by-point manner.

In general, constructions of a noun with a noun in apposition, an adjective, or
a participle are based on a deep structure containing a relative clause: “all these
modes of speech include the relative pronoun in their meaning, and may be
resolved by using it” (p. 69; PRG 100). The same deep structure may be realized
differently in different languages, as when Latin has “video canem currentem,”
and French “Je voy un chien qui court” (pp. 69–70; PRG 100). The position of
the relative pronoun in the “subordinate proposition” [proposition incidente] is
determined by a rule that converts deep structure to surface structure. We see
this, for example, in such phrases as “God whom I love” and “God by whom the
world has been created.”

In such cases,
the relative pronoun is always placed at the beginning of the proposition (although,
according to the meaning it ought to be only at the end), unless it is governed by a
preposition, for the preposition comes first, at least ordinarily. (p. 71; PRG 101)
In the case of each of the sentences just discussed, the deep structure consists
of a system of propositions, and it does not receive a direct, point-by-point expression in the actual physical object that is produced. To form an actual sentence from such an underlying system of elementary propositions, we apply certain rules (in modern terms, grammatical transformations). 

In these examples, we apply the rule preposing the relative pronoun that takes the place of the noun of the incident proposition (along with the preposition that precedes it, if there is one). We may then, optionally, go on to delete the relative pronoun, at the same time deleting the copula (as in “Dieu invisible”) or changing the form of the verb (as in “canis currens”). Finally, we must, in certain cases, interchange the order of the noun and the adjective (as in “un habile magistrat”).68

The deep structure that expresses the meaning is common to all languages, so
it is claimed, being a simple reflection of the forms of thought. The transforma-
tional rules that convert deep to surface structure may differ from language to
language. The surface structure resulting from these transformations does not
directly express the meaning relations of the words, of course, except in the
simplest cases. It is the deep structure underlying the actual utterance, a
structure that is purely mental, that conveys the semantic content of the sen-
tence. This deep structure is, nevertheless, related to actual sentences in that
each of its component abstract propositions (in the cases just discussed) could
be directly realized as a simple propositional judgment.

The theory of essential and incident propositions as constituent elements of
deep structure is extended in the Port-Royal Logic69 with a more detailed
analysis of relative clauses. There, a distinction is developed between explica-
tive (nonrestrictive or appositive) and determinative (restrictive) relative
clauses. The distinction is based on a prior analysis of the “comprehension”
and “extension” of “universal ideas,”70 in modern terms, an analysis of meaning
and reference. The comprehension of an idea is the set of essential attributes that
define it, together with whatever can be deduced from them; its extension is the
set of objects that it denotes:

The comprehension of an idea is the constituent parts which make up the idea, none of
which can be removed without destroying the idea. For example, the idea of a triangle is
made up of the idea of having three sides, the idea of having three angles, and the idea of
having angles whose sum is equal to two right angles, and so on.

The extension of an idea is the objects to which the word expressing the idea can be
applied. The objects which belong to the extension of an idea are called the inferiors of
that idea, which with respect to them is called the superior. Thus, the general idea of
triangle has in its extension triangles of all kinds whatsoever. (p. 51; PRL 39–40)
In terms of these notions, we can distinguish such “explications” as “Paris,
which is the largest city in Europe” and “man, who is mortal” from “determi-
nations” such as “transparent bodies, wise men” or “a body which is trans-
parent, men who are pious” (pp. 59–60, 118; PRL 44–45, 89):

A complex expression is a mere explication if either (1) the idea expressed by the
complex expression is already contained in the comprehension of the idea expressed  by the principal word of the complex expression, or (2) the idea expressed by the
complex expression is the idea of some accidental characteristic of all the inferiors of
an idea expressed by the principal word.


A complex expression is a determination if the extension of the idea expressed by
the complex term is less than the extension of the idea expressed by the principal
word. 


In the case of an explicative relative clause, the underlying deep structure actually implies the judgment expressed by this clause, when its relative pronoun is replaced by its antecedent. For example, the sentence “men, who were created to know and love God, ...” implies that men were created to know and love God. Thus an explicative relative clause has the essential properties of conjunction. But in the case of a restrictive relative clause (a determination), this is obviously not true.

Thus in saying “Men who are pious are charitable,” we do not affirm either that men are pious or that men are charitable. In stating this proposition, we form a complex idea by joining together two simple ideas – the idea of man and the idea of piety – and we judge that the attribute of being charitable is part of this complex idea. Thus the subordinate clause asserts nothing more than that the idea of piety is not incompatible with the idea of man. Having made this judgment we then consider what idea can be affirmed of this complex idea of pious man. (p. 119; PRL 89–90) Similarly, consider the expression “The doctrine which identifies the sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body, which was taught by Epicurus, is unworthy of a philosopher.”71

This contains the subject “The doctrine which ... taught by Epicurus” and the predicate “unworthy of a philosopher.” The subject is complex, containing the restrictive relative clause “which identifies the sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body” and the explicative relative clause “which was taught by Epicurus.” The relative pronoun in the latter has as its antecedent the complex expression “the doctrine which identifies the sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body.” Since the clause “which was taught by Epicurus” is explicative, the original sentence does imply that the doctrine in question was taught by Epicurus. But the relative pronoun of the restrictive clause cannot be replaced by its antecedent, “the doctrine,” to form an assertion implied by the full sentence.

 Once again, the complex phrase
containing the restrictive relative clause and its antecedent expresses a single
complex idea formed from the two ideas of a doctrine and of identifying the
sovereign good with the sensual pleasure of the body. All this information must
be represented in the deep structure of the original sentence, according to the
Port-Royal theory, and the semantic interpretation of this sentence must proceed
in the manner just indicated, utilizing this information (pp. 119–120; PRL 90).

A restrictive relative clause is based on a proposition, according to the Port-Royal theory, even though this proposition is not affirmed when the relative clause is used in a complex expression. What is affirmed in an expres-
sion such as men who are pious, as noted above, is no more than the compat-
ibility of the constituent ideas. Hence in the expression “minds which are square
are more solid than those which are round,” we may correctly say that the
relative clause is “false,” in a certain sense, since “the idea of being square” is
not compatible with “the idea of mind understood as the principle of thought”
(p. 124; PRL 93).

Thus sentences containing explicative as well as restrictive relative clauses
are based on systems of propositions (that is, abstract objects constituting the
meanings of sentences);72 but the manner of interconnection is different in the
case of an explicative clause, in which the underlying judgment is actually
affirmed, and a determinative clause, in which the proposition formed by
replacing the relative pronoun by its antecedent is not affirmed but rather
constitutes a single complex idea together with this noun.

These observations are surely correct, in essence, and must be accommodated
in any syntactic theory that attempts to make the notion “deep structure” precise
and to formulate and investigate the principles that relate deep structure to
surface organization. In short, these observations must be accommodated in
some fashion in any theory of transformational generative grammar. Such a
theory is concerned precisely with the rules that specify deep structures and
relate them to surface structures and with the rules of semantic and phonological
interpretation that apply to deep and surface structures respectively. It is, in
other words, in large measure an elaboration and formalization of notions that
are implicit and in part expressly formulated in such passages as those just
discussed. In many respects it seems to me quite accurate, then, to regard the
theory of transformational generative grammar, as it is developing in current
work, as essentially a modern and more explicit version of the Port-Royal
theory.

In the Port-Royal theory, the relative pronoun that occurs in the surface form
does not always have the dual function of standing for a noun and connecting
propositions. It may be “shorn of its pronominal nature” and may thus serve
only the latter role. For example, in such sentences as “I suppose that you will be
wise” and “I tell you that you are wrong” we find that, in the deep structure,
“these propositions, ‘you will be wise’, ‘you are wrong’, make up only part of
the whole propositions ‘I suppose ...’ and ‘I tell you ...’” 

The Grammar goes on to argue that infinitival constructions play the same
role in the verbal system that relative clauses play in the nominal system,
providing a means for extending the verbal system through the incorporation
of whole propositions: “the infinitive is, among the other moods of the verb,
what the relative is among the other pronouns” (pp. 111–112; PRG 139); like the
relative pronoun, “the infinitive has, over and above the affirmation of the verb, the power to join the proposition in which it appears to another proposition”.

Thus the meaning of “scio malum esse fugiendum” is
conveyed by a deep structure based on the two propositions expressed by the
sentences “scio” and “malum est fugiendum.” The transformational rule (in
modern terms) that forms the surface structure of the sentence replaces “est” by
“esse”, just as the transformations that form such sentences as “Dieu (qui est)
invisible a créé le monde (qui est) visible” perform various operations of
substitution, reordering, and deletion on the underlying systems of propositions.
“And from this has come the fact that in French we almost always render the
infinitive by the indicative of the verb and the particle ‘que’: ‘Je sais que le mal
est à fuir’” (p. 112; PRG 140). In this case, the identity of deep structure in Latin
and French may be somewhat obscured by the fact that the two languages use
slightly different transformational operations to derive the surface forms.
The Grammar goes on to point out that indirect discourse can be analyzed in
a similar way.74 If the underlying embedded proposition is interrogative, it is the
particle “if” rather than “that” that is introduced by the transformational rule, as
in “They asked me if I could do that,” where the “discourse which is reported” is
“Can you do that?” Sometimes, in fact, no particle need be added, a change of
person being sufficient, as in “He asked me: Who are you?” as compared with
“He asked me who I was”.


Summarizing the Port-Royal theory in its major outlines, a sentence has an
inner mental aspect (a deep structure that conveys its meaning) and an outer,
physical aspect as a sound sequence. Its surface analysis into phrases may not
indicate the significant connections of the deep structure by any formal mark or
by the actual arrangement of words. The deep structure is, however, represented
in the mind as the physical utterance is produced. The deep structure consists of
a system of propositions, organized in various ways. 

The elementary proposi-
tions that constitute the deep structure are of the subject-predicate form, with
simple subjects and predicates (i.e., categories instead of more complex
phrases). Many of these elementary objects can be independently realized as
sentences. It is not true, in general, that the elementary judgments constituting
the deep structure are affirmed when the sentence that it underlies is produced;
explicative and determinative relatives, for example, differ in this respect. To
actually produce a sentence from the deep structure that conveys the thought
that it expresses, it is necessary to apply rules of transformation that rearrange,
replace, or delete items of the sentence. Some of these are obligatory, further
ones optional. Thus “God, who is invisible, created the world, which is visible”
is distinguished from its paraphrase, “Invisible God created the visible world,”
by an optional deletion operation, but the transformation that substitutes a
relative pronoun for the noun and then preposes the pronoun is obligatory.


This account covers only the sentences based exclusively on judgments. But
these, although the principal form of thought, do not exhaust the “operations of  our minds,” and “one must still relate to what occurs in our mind the conjunctions, disjunctions, and other similar operations of our minds, and all the other
movements of our souls, such as desires, commands, questions, etc.” (p. 29;
PRG 67). In part, these other “forms of thought” are signified by special
particles such as “and,” “not,” “or,” “if,” “therefore,” etc. (pp. 137–138; PRG
168). But with respect to these sentence types as well, an identity of deep
structure may be masked through divergence of the transformational means
whereby actual sentences are formed, corresponding to intended meanings. A
case in point is interrogation. In Latin, the interrogative particle ne “has no
object outside the mind, but only marks the movement of the soul, by which we
wish to know a thing” (p. 138; PRG 168). As for the interrogative pronoun, “it is
nothing more than a pronoun to which the signification of ‘ne’ is added; that is
to say, which, beyond taking the place of a noun like the other pronouns, further
marks this movement of the soul which desires to know something and which
demands to be instructed about it” (p. 138; PRG 168). But this “movement of
the soul” can be signified in various ways other than by the addition of a
particle, for example, by vocal inflection or inversion of word order, as
in French, where the pronominal subject is “transported” to the position
following the person marker of the verb (preserving the agreement of the
underlying form). These are all devices for realizing the same deep structure.

Notice that the theory of deep and surface structure as developed in the
Port-Royal linguistic studies implicitly contains recursive devices and thus
provides for infinite use of the finite means that it disposes, as any adequate
theory of language must. We see, moreover, that, in the examples given, the
recursive devices meet certain formal conditions that have no a priori necessity.
In both the trivial cases (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, etc.) and the more
interesting ones discussed in connection with relatives and infinitives, the
only method for extending deep structures is by adding full propositions of a
basic subject-predicate form. The transformational rules of deletion, rearrange-
ment, etc., do not play a role in the creation of new structures. The extent to
which the Port-Royal grammarians may have been aware of or interested in
these properties of their theory is, of course, an open question.

In modern terms, we may formalize this view by describing the syntax of a
language in terms of two systems of rules: a base system that generates deep
structures and a transformational system that maps these into surface structures.
The base system consists of rules that generate the underlying grammatical
relations with an abstract order (the rewriting rules of a phrase-structure gram-
mar); the transformational system consists of rules of deletion, rearrangement,
adjunction, and so on. The base rules allow for the introduction of new
propositions (that is, there are rewriting rules of the form A → ...S..., where
S is the initial symbol of the phrase-structure grammar that constitutes the base); 

there are no other recursive devices. Among the transformations are those which
form questions, imperatives, etc., when the deep structure so indicates (i.e.,
when the deep structure represents the corresponding “mental act” in an appro-
priate notation).75

The Port-Royal grammar is apparently the first to develop the notion of
phrase structure in any fairly clear way.76 It is interesting, therefore, to notice
that it also states quite clearly the inadequacy of phrase-structure description for
the representation of syntactic structure and that it hints at a form of transforma-
tional grammar in many respects akin to that which is being actively studied
today.
