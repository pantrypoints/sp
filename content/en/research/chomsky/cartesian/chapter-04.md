We have so far extracted from “Cartesian linguistics” certain characteristic and
quite important doctrines regarding the nature of language and have, quite
sketchily, traced their development during the period from Descartes to
Humboldt. 

As a by-product of this study of langue, and against the background
of rationalist theory of mind, certain views emerged as to how language is
acquired and used. After a long interlude, these views are once again beginning
to receive the attention that they deserve, although their appearance (like the
reappearance of the central ideas of transformational grammar) was, in fact, a
largely independent development.

The central doctrine of Cartesian linguistics is that the general features of
grammatical structure are common to all languages and reflect certain funda-
mental properties of the mind. It is this assumption which led the philosophical
grammarians to concentrate on “grammaire générale” rather than “grammaire
particulière” and which expresses itself in Humboldt’s belief that deep analysis
will show a common “form of language” underlying national and individual
variety.107 There are, then, certain language universals that set limits to the
variety of human language.108 The study of the universal conditions that
prescribe the form of any human language is “grammaire générale.” Such
universal conditions are not learned; rather, they provide the organizing princi-
ples that make language learning possible, that must exist if data are to lead to
knowledge. By attributing such principles to the mind, as an innate property, it
becomes possible to account for the quite obvious fact that the speaker of a
language knows a great deal that he has not learned.
In approaching the question of language acquisition and linguistic universals
in this way, Cartesian linguistics reflects the concern of seventeenth-century
rationalistic psychology with the contribution of the mind to human knowledge.
Perhaps the earliest exposition of what was to become a major theme, through-
out most of this century, is Herbert of Cherburys De Veritate (1624),109 in which
he develops the view that there are certain “principles or notions implanted in
the mind” that “we bring to objects from ourselves ... [as] ... a direct gift of
Nature, a precept of natural instinct” (p. 133). Although these Common Notions
“are stimulated by objects,” nevertheless, “no one, however wild his views,  

imagines that they are conveyed by objects themselves” (p. 126). Rather, they
are essential to the identification of objects and the understanding of their
properties and relations. Although the “intellectual truths” comprised among
the Common Notions “seem to vanish in the absence of objects, yet they cannot
be wholly passive and idle seeing that they are essential to objects and objects to
them ... It is only with their aid that the intellect, whether in familiar or new
types of things, can be led to decide whether our subjective faculties have
accurate knowledge of the facts” (p. 105). By application of these intellectual
truths, which are “imprinted on the soul by the dictates of Nature itself,” we can
compare and combine individual sensations and interpret experience in terms of
objects, their properties, and the events in which they participate Evidently,
these interpretive principles cannot be learned from experience in their entirety,
and they may be independent of experience altogether. According to Herbert:
[They] are so far from being drawn from experience or observation that, without several
of them, or at least one of them, we could have no experience at all nor be capable of
observations. For if it had not been written in our soul that we should examine into the
nature of things (and we do not derive this command from objects), and if we had not
been endowed with Common Notions, to that end, we should never come to distinguish
between things, or to grasp any general nature. Vacant forms, prodigies, and fearful
images would pass meaninglessly and even dangerously before our minds, unless there
existed within us, in the shape of notions imprinted in the mind, that analogous faculty by
which we distinguish good from evil. From where else could we have received knowl-
edge? In consequence, anyone who considers to what extent objects in their external
relationship contribute to their correct perception; who seeks to estimate what is con-
tributed by us, or to discover what is due to alien or accidental sources, or again to innate
influences, or to factors arising from nature, will be led to refer to these principles. We
listen to the voice of nature not only in our choice between what is good and evil,
beneficial and harmful, but also in that external correspondence by which we distinguish
truth from falsehood, we possess hidden faculties which when stimulated by objects
quickly respond to them. (pp. 105–106)
It is only by the use of these “inborn capacities or Common Notions” that the
intellect can determine “whether our subjective faculties have exercised their
perceptions well or ill” (p. 87). This “natural instinct” thus instructs us in the
nature, manner, and scope of what is to be heard, hoped for, or desired” (p. 132).
Care must be taken in determining what are the Common Notions, the innate
organizing principles and concepts that make experience possible. For Herbert,
the “chief criterion of Natural Instinct” is “universal consent” (p. 139). But two
qualifications are necessary. First, what is referred to is universal consent among
“normal men” (p. 105). That is, we must put aside “persons who are out of their
minds or mentally incapable” (p. 139) and those who are “headstrong, foolish,
weak-minded and imprudent” (p. 125). And although these faculties “may not
ever be entirely absent,” and “even in madmen, drunkards, and infants extra-
ordinary internal powers may be detected which minister to their safety” 

(p. 125), still we can expect to find universal consent to Common Notions only
among the normal, rational, and clearheaded. Second, appropriate experience is
necessary to elicit or activate these innate principles; “it is the law or destiny of
Common Notions and indeed of the other forms of knowledge to be inactive
unless objects stimulate them” (p. 120). In this respect, the common notions are
like the faculties of seeing, hearing, loving, hoping, etc., with which we are born
and which “remain latent when their corresponding objects are not present, and
even disappear and give no sign of their existence” (p. 132). But this fact must
not blind us to the realization that “the Common Notions must be deemed not so
much the outcome of experience as principles without which we should have no
experience at all” and to the absurdity of the theory that “our mind is a clean
sheet, as though we obtained our capacity for dealing with objects from objects
themselves” (p. 132).
The common notions are “all intimately connected” and can be arranged into
a system (p. 120); and although “an infinite number of faculties may be
awakened in response to an infinite number of new objects, all the Common
Notions which embrace this order of facts may be comprehended in a few
propositions” (p. 106). This system of common notions is not to be identified
with “reason.” It simply forms “that part of knowledge with which we were
endowed in the primeval plan of Nature,” and it is important to bear in mind that
“it is the nature of natural instinct to fulfil itself irrationally, that is to say,
without foresight.” On the other hand, “reason is the process of applying
Common Notions as far as it can” (pp. 120–121).
In focusing attention on the innate interpretive principles that are a precondi-
tion for experience and knowledge and in emphasizing that these are implicit
and may require external stimulation in order to become active or available to
introspection, Herbert expressed much of the psychological theory that under-
lies Cartesian linguistics, just as he emphasized those aspects of cognition that
were developed by Descartes and, later, by the English Platonists, Leibniz, and
Kant.110
The psychology that develops in this way is a kind of Platonism without
preexistence. Leibniz makes this explicit in many places. Thus he holds that
“nothing can be taught us of which we have not already in our minds the idea,”
and he recalls Plato’s “experiment” with the slave boy in the Meno as proving
that “the soul virtually knows those things [i.e., truths of geometry, in this case],
and needs only to be reminded (animadverted) to recognize the truths.
Consequently, it possesses at least the idea upon which these truths depend.
We may say even that it already possesses those truths, if we consider them as
the relations of the ideas” (§26).111
Of course, what is latent in the mind in this sense may often require appro-
priate external stimulation before it becomes active, and many of the innate
principles that determine the nature of thought and experience may well be 

applied quite unconsciously. This Leibniz emphasizes, in particular, throughout
his Nouveaux Essais.
That the principles of language and natural logic are known unconsciously112
and that they are in large measure a precondition for language acquisition rather
than a matter of “institution” or “training” is the general presupposition of
Cartesian linguistics.113 When Cordemoy, for example, considers language
acquisition (op. cit., pp. 40ff.), he discusses the role of instruction and condition-
ing of a sort, but he also notices that much of what children know is acquired quite
apart from any explicit instruction,114 and he concludes that language learning
presupposes possession of “wholly developed reason [la raison toute entière] for
indeed this way of learning to speak is the result of discernment so great and
reason so perfect that it is impossible to conceive of any more marvelous” (p. 59).
Rationalist conclusions reappear with some of the romantics as well. Thus
A. W. Schlegel writes that “human reason may be compared to a substance
which is infinitely combustible but does not burst into flame on its own: a spark
must be thrown into the soul” (“De l’étymologie en général,” p. 127).
Communication with an already formed intellect is necessary for reason to
awaken. But external stimulation is only required to set innate mechanisms to
work; it does not determine the form of what is acquired. In fact, it is clear “that
this acquisition [of language] through communication already presupposes the
ability to invent language” (Kunstlehre, p. 234). In a certain sense, language is
innate to man; namely, “in the truer philosophical sense in which everything
that, according to the usual view, is innate to man, can only be brought forth
through his own activity” (ibid., p. 235). While Schlegel’s precise intentions,
with many such remarks, might be debated, in Humboldt the Platonism with
respect to language acquisition is quite clear. For Humboldt, “to learn is ...
always merely to regenerate” (op. cit., p. 126). Despite superficial appearances,
a language “cannot properly be taught but only awakened in the mind; it can
only be given the threads by which it develops on its own account”; thus
languages are, in a sense, “self-creations” [Selbstschöpfungen] of individuals
(p. 50; Humboldt 1999: 43–4):
Language-learning of children is not an assignment of words, to be deposited in memory
and rebabbled by rote through the lips, but a growth in linguistic capacity with age and
practice. (p. 71)
That in children there is not a mechanical learning of language, but a development of
linguistic power, is also proven by the fact that since the major abilities of humans are
allotted a certain period of life for their development, all children, under the most diverse
conditions, speak and understand at about the same age, varying only within a brief time-
span. (p. 72; Humboldt 1999: 58)
In short, language acquisition is a matter of growth and maturation of
relatively fixed capacities, under appropriate external conditions. The form of 

the language that is acquired is largely determined by internal factors; it is
because of the fundamental correspondence of all human languages, because of
the fact that “human beings are the same, wherever they may be” [der Mensch
überall Eins mit dem Menschen ist], that a child can learn any language
(p. 73).115 The functioning of the language capacity is, furthermore, optimal
at a certain “critical period” of intellectual development.
It is important to emphasize that seventeenth-century rationalism approaches
the problem of learning – in particular, language learning – in a fundamentally
nondogmatic fashion. It notes that knowledge arises on the basis of very scattered
and inadequate data and that there are uniformities in what is learned that are in no
way uniquely determined by the data itself (see note 114). Consequently, these
properties are attributed to the mind, as preconditions for experience. This is
essentially the line of reasoning that would be taken, today, by a scientist interested
in the structure of some device for which he has only input–output data. In
contrast, empiricist speculation, particularly in its modern versions, has character-
istically adopted certain a priori assumptions regarding the nature of learning (that
it must be based on association or reinforcement, or on inductive procedures of an
elementary sort – e.g., the taxonomic procedures of modern linguistics, etc.) and
has not considered the necessity for checking these assumptions against the
observed uniformities of “output” – against what is known or believed after
“learning” has taken place. Hence the charge of a priorism or dogmatism often
leveled against rationalistic psychology and philosophy of mind seems clearly to
be misdirected. (For further discussion, see the references in note 110.)
The strong assumptions about innate mental structure made by rationalistic
psychology and philosophy of mind eliminated the necessity for any sharp
distinction between a theory of perception and a theory of learning. In both
cases, essentially the same processes are at work; a store of latent principles is
brought to the interpretation of the data of sense. There is, to be sure, a differ-
ence between the initial “activation” of latent structure and the use of it once it
has become readily available for the interpretation (more accurately, the deter-
mination) of experience. The confused ideas that are always latent in the mind
may, in other words, become distinct (see note 111), and at this point they can
heighten and enhance perception. Thus, for example, a
skilful and expert limner will observe many elegancies and curiosities of art, and be
highly pleased with several strokes and shadows in a picture, where a common eye can
discern nothing at all; and a musical artist hearing a consort of exact musicians playing
some excellent composure of many parts, will be exceedingly ravished with many
harmonical airs and touches, that a vulgar ear will be utterly insensible of. (Cudworth,
op. cit., p. 446; Cudworth 1996: 109)
It is the “acquired skill” that makes the difference; “the artists of either kind have
many inward anticipations of skill and art in their minds” that enable them to
interpret the data of sense in a way that goes beyond the “mere noise and sound  

and clatter” provided by passive sense, just as the informed mind can interpret
the “vital machine of the universe” in terms of “interior symmetry and harmony
in the relations, proportions, aptitudes and correspondence of things to one
another in the great mundane system” (ibid.). Similarly, in looking at and
“judging of” a picture of a friend, one makes use of a “foreign and adventitious”
but preexistent idea (pp. 456–457; Cudworth 1996: 109). Once this distinction
between learning and perception has been noted, however, the essential parallel
between the cognitive processes that are involved outweighs the relatively
superficial differences, from the point of view of this rationalist doctrine. For
this reason, it is often unclear whether what is being discussed is the activity of
the mind in perception or in acquisition – that is, in selecting an already distinct
idea on the occasion of sense, or in making distinct what was before only
confused and implicit.
Descartes’s theory of cognition is clearly summarized in his Comments on a
Certain Broadsheet (1648):
...if we bear well in mind the scope of our senses and what it is exactly that reaches our
faculty of thinking by way of them, we must admit that in no case are the ideas of things
presented to us by the senses just as we form them in our thinking. So much so that there
is nothing in our ideas which is not innate to the mind or the faculty of thinking, with the
sole exception of those circumstances which relate to experience, such as the fact that we
judge this or that idea which we now have immediately before our mind refers to a certain
thing situated outside us. We make such a judgement not because these things transmit
the ideas to our mind through the sense organs, but because they transmit something
which, at exactly that moment, gives the mind occasion to form these ideas by means of
the faculty innate to it. Nothing reaches our mind from external objects through the sense
organs except certain corporeal motions ... But neither the motions themselves nor the
figures arising from them are conceived by us exactly as they occur in the sense organs ...
Hence it follows that the very ideas of the motions themselves and of the figures are
innate in us. The ideas of pain, colours, sounds, and the like must be all the more innate if,
on the occasion of certain corporeal motions, our mind is to be capable of representing
them to itself, for there is no similarity between these ideas and the corporeal motions. Is
it possible to imagine anything more absurd than that all the common notions within our
mind arise from such motions and cannot exist without them? I would like our author to
tell me what the corporeal motion is that is capable of forming some common notion to
the effect that ‘things which are equal to a third thing are equal to each other’, or any other
he cares to take. For all such motions are particular, whereas the common notions are
universal and bear no affinity with, or relation to, the motions. (CSM I, 304–305)
Rather similar ideas are developed at length by Cudworth.116 He distin-
guished the essentially passive faculty of sense from the active and innate
“cognoscitive powers” whereby men (and men alone) “are enabled to under-
stand or judge of what is received from without by sense.” This cognoscitive
power is not a mere storehouse of ideas, but “a power of raising intelligible ideas
and conceptions of things from within itself” (p. 425; Cudworth 1996: 75). The
function of sense is “the offering or presenting of some object to the mind, to



give it an occasion to exercise its own activity upon.” Thus, for example, when
we look into the street and perceive men walking, we are relying, not merely on
sense (which shows us at most surfaces – i.e., hats and clothes – and, in fact, not
even objects), but on the exercise of the understanding, applied to the data of
sense (pp. 409–410; Cudworth 1996: 57–59).117 The “intelligible forms by
which things are understood or known, are not stamps or impressions passively
printed upon the soul from without, but ideas vitally protended or actively
exerted from within itself.” Thus prior knowledge and set play a large role in
determining what we see (e.g., a familiar face in a crowd) (pp. 423–424;
Cudworth 1996: 74). It is because we use intellectual ideas in perception “that
those knowledges which are more abstract and remote from matter, are more
accurate, intelligible and demonstrable, – than those which are conversant about
concrete and material things,” as Aristotle has observed (p. 427; Cudworth
1996: 78).118 This claim is illustrated by a discussion of our conceptions of
geometrical figures (pp. 455f.; Cudworth 1996: 103ff.). Obviously every sensed
triangle is irregular, and if there were a physically perfect one, we could not
detect this by sense; “and every irregular and imperfect triangle [is] as perfectly
that which it is, as the most perfect triangle.” Our judgments regarding external
objects in terms of regular figures, our very notion of “regular figure” therefore
have their source in the “rule, pattern and exemplar” which are generated by the
mind as an “anticipation.” The concept of a triangle or of a “regular propor-
tionate and symmetrical figure” is not taught but “springs originally from nature
itself,” as does, in general, the human concept of “pulchritude and deformity in
material objects”; nor can the a priori truths of geometry be derived from sense.
And it is only by means of these “inward ideas” produced by its “innate
cognoscitive power” that the mind is able to “know and understand all external
individual things” (p. 482; Cudworth 1996: 101–128 passim).
Descartes had discussed the same question in very similar terms, in his Reply
to Objections V:
Hence, when in our childhood we first happened to see a triangular figure drawn on
paper, it cannot have been this figure that showed us how we should conceive of the true
triangle studied by geometers, since the true triangle is contained in the figure only in the
way in which a statue of Mercury is contained in a rough block of wood. But since the
idea of the true triangle was already in us, and could be conceived by our mind more
easily than the more composite figure of the triangle drawn on paper, when we saw the
composite figure we did not apprehend the figure we saw, but rather the true triangle.
(CSM II, 262)
For Cudworth, the interpretation of sensory data in terms of objects and their
relations, in terms of cause and effect, the relations of whole and part, symmetry,
proportion, the functions served by objects and the characteristic uses to which
they are put (in the case of all “things artificial” or “compounded natural
things”), moral judgments, etc., is the result of the organizing activity of the 


mind (pp. 433f.; Cudworth 1996: 83–100). The same is true of the unity of
objects (or, for example, of a melody); sense is like a “narrow telescope” that
provides only piecemeal and successive views, but only the mind can give “one
comprehensive idea of the whole” with all its parts, relations, proportions, and
Gestalt qualities. It is in this sense that we speak of the intelligible idea of an
object as not “stamped or impressed upon the soul from without, but upon
occasion of the sensible idea excited and exerted from the inward active and
comprehensive power of the intellect itself” (p. 439; Cudworth 1996: 91).119
Ideas of this sort regarding perception were common in the seventeenth
century but were then swept aside by the empiricist current, to be revived
again by Kant and the romantics.120 Consider, for example, Coleridge’s remarks
on active processes in perception:
Instances in which a knowledge given to the mind quickens and invigorates the faculties
by which such knowledge is attainable independently cannot have escaped the most
ordinary observer, and this is equally true whether it be faculties of the mind or of the
senses ... It is indeed wonderful both how small a likeness will suffice a full apprehen-
sion of sound or sight when the correspondent sound or object is foreknown and
foreimagined and how small a deviation or imperfection will render the whole confused
and indistinguishable or mistaken where no such previous intimation has been received.
Hence all unknown languages appear to a foreigner to be spoken by the natives with
extreme rapidity and to those who are but beginning to understand it with a distressing
indistinction.121
Does nature present objects to us without exciting any act on our part, does she present
them under all circumstances perfect and as it were ready made? Such may be the notion
of the most unthinking ... not only must we have some scheme or general outline of the
object to which we could determine to direct our attention, were it only to have the power
of recognizing it ...122
It is, once again, with Humboldt that these ideas are applied most clearly to
the perception and interpretation of speech. He argues that there is a fundamen-
tal difference between the perception of speech and the perception of unarticu-
lated sound (cf. note 38). For the latter, “an animal’s sensory capacity” would
suffice. But human speech perception is not merely a matter of “mere mutual
evocation of the sound and the object indicated” (Verschiedenheit, p. 70;
Humboldt 1999: 57). For one thing, a word is not “an impression of the object
in itself, but rather of its image, produced in the soul” (p. 74). But, furthermore,
speech perception requires an analysis of the incoming signal in terms of the
underlying elements that function in the essentially creative act of speech
production, and therefore it requires the activation of the generative system
that plays a role in production of speech as well, since it is only in terms of these
fixed rules that the elements and their relations are defined. The underlying
“rules of generation” must, therefore, function in speech perception. If it were
not for its mastery of these, if it were not for its ability “to actualize every 

possibility” the mind would no more be able to deal with the mechanisms of
articulated speech than a blind man is able to perceive colors. It follows, then,
that both the perceptual mechanisms and the mechanisms of speech production
must make use of the underlying system of generative rules. It is because of the
virtual identity of this underlying system in speaker and hearer that communi-
cation can take place, the sharing of an underlying generative system being
traceable, ultimately, to the uniformity of human nature (cf. pp. 101–102 above
and note 115). In brief,
There can be nothing present in the soul, save by one’s own activity, and understanding
and speaking are but different effects of this power of speech. Conversing together is
never comparable with a transfer of material. In the understander, as in the speaker, the
same thing must be developed from the inner power of each; and what the former
receives is merely the harmoniously attuning stimulus ... In this way language in its
entirety resides in every human being, which means, however, nothing else but that
everyone possesses an urge governed by a specifically modified, limiting and confining
power, to bring forth gradually the whole of language from within himself, or when
brought forth to understand it, as outer or inner occasion may determine.
But understanding could not, as we have just found, be based upon inner spontaneity,
and communal speech would have to be something other than mere mutual arousal of the
hearer’s speech capacity, did not the diversity of individuals harbor the unity of human
nature, fragmented only into separate individualities. (p. 70; Humboldt 1999: 57 [with
modifications])
Even in the case of perception of a single word, an underlying system of
generative rules must be activated. It would be inaccurate, Humboldt maintains,
to suppose that speaker and hearer share a store of clear and totally formed
concepts. Rather, the perceived sound incites the mind to generate a correspond-
ing concept by its own means:
[People] do not understand one another by actually exchanging signs for things, nor by
mutually occasioning one another to produce exactly and completely the same concept;
they do it by touching in one another the same link in the chain of their sensory ideas and
internal conceptualizations, by striking the same note on their mental instrument, where-
upon matching but not identical concepts are engendered in each. (p. 213; Humboldt
1999: 152)
In short, speech perception requires internal generation of a representation both
of the signal and the associated semantic content.
Contemporary research in perception has returned to the investigation of the
role of internally represented schemata or models123 and has begun to elaborate
the somewhat deeper insight that it is not merely a store of schemata that
function in perception but rather a system of fixed rules for generating such
schemata.124 In this respect too, it would be quite accurate to describe current
work as a continuation of the tradition of Cartesian linguistics and the psychol-
ogy that underlies it.
