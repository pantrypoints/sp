{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The superior man:
- regards righteousness as the thing material
- gives operation to it according to the Rules of Propriety
- lets it issue in humility
- becomes complete in sincerity

The trouble of the superior man will be his own lack of ability. It will be no trouble to him that others do not know him. 

Such a man thinks that it is hard to end his days and leave a name to be no longer named. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The superior man is exacting of himself. The common man is exacting of others. 

A superior man:
- has self-respect
- does not strive
- is sociable, yet no party man. 

He does not promote a man because of his words, or pass over the words because of the man.

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
Is there one word upon which the whole life may proceed?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
It is Reciprocity. What you do not yourself desire, do not put before others. 

So far as I have to do with others, whom do I over-censure? Whom do I over-praise? 

If there be something in them that looks very praiseworthy, that something I put to the test. 

I would have the men of the present day to walk in the straight path whereby those of the Three Dynasties have walked.

I have arrived as it were at the annalist's blank page. Once he who had a horse would lend it to another to mount. Now, alas! it is not so. 

Artful speech is the confusion of Virtue. Impatience over little things introduces confusion into great schemes.

We should inquire what is disliked and preferred by the masses. 

A man may give breadth to his principles. It is not principles (in themselves) that give breadth to the man.

Not to retract after committing an error may itself be called error. 

I do not profit by passing the whole day without food and the whole night without sleep occupied with my thoughts.
- I were better engaged in learning. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The superior man deliberates on how he may walk in truth, not upon what he may eat.
- The farmer may plough, and be on the way to want.
- The student learns, and is on his way to emolument. 

To live a right life is the concern of men of nobler minds. Poverty gives them none.

Whatsoever the intellect may attain to, unless the humanity within is powerful enough to keep guard over it, is assuredly lost, even though it be gained. 

If there be intellectual attainments, and the humanity within is powerful enough to keep guard over them, yet, unless (in a ruler) there be dignity in his rule, the people will fail to show him respect.

Again, given the intellectual attainments, and humanity sufficient to keep watch over them, and also dignity in ruling, yet if his movements be not in accordance with the Rules of Propriety, he is not yet fully qualified.

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The superior man might not be conversant with petty details, and yet may have important matters put into his hands. 

The inferior man might not be charged with important matters, yet may be conversant with the petty details.

Good-fellowship is more to men than fire and water. I have seen men stepping into fire and into water, and meeting with death thereby.

I have not yet seen a man die from planting his steps in the path of good-fellowship. 

Rely on good nature. 'Twill not allow precedence even to a teacher.

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
The superior man is inflexibly upright, and does not take things on trust.

In serving your prince, make your service the serious concern, and let salary be a secondary matter. 

Where instruction is to be given, there must be no distinction of persons.
- Where men's methods are not identical, there can be no planning by one on behalf of another. 

In speaking, perspicuity is all that is needed.

### Confucius and the Blind Music-master

The blind music-master Mien paid him a visit. On his approaching the steps, the Master called out:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Steps
{{< /l >}}


And on his coming to the mat, he said:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Mat
{{< /l >}}


When all in the room were seated, the Master told him:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
So-and-so is here, so-and-so is here.
{{< /l >}}


When the music-master had left, Tsz-chang asked him:

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
Is that the way to speak to the music-master?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Well, it is certainly the way to assist him.
