Yang Ho wanted to interview Confucius. But Confucius failed to go and see him. So he sent a pig as a present to his house. 

Confucius went to return his acknowledgments for it when he was not at home. They met, however, on the way.

He said to Confucius:

{{< r a="Yang-Ho" >}}
Come, I want a word with you. 

Does a man have good-will towards his fellow-men if he:
- allows his country to go on in blind error and
- hugs and hides his own precious gifts?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
He cannot. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Yang-Ho" >}}
Is a man who likes to take part in the public service but is constantly letting slip his opportunities, wise? 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
He cannot. The days and months are passing; and the years do not wait for us.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Yang-Ho" >}}
True, I will take office.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
While by nature we approximate towards each other, by experience we go far asunder.

Only the supremely wise and the most deeply ignorant do not alter.
{{< /l >}}


The Master once, on his arrival at Wu-shing, heard the sound of stringed instruments and singing. 

His face beamed with pleasure, and he said laughingly:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
To kill a cock why use an ox-knife?
{{< /l >}}
 

{{< r a="Governor Tsz-Yu" >}}
In former days, sir, I heard you say, 'Let the superior man learn right principles, and he will be loving to other men; let the ordinary person learn right principles, and he will be easily managed.'
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
[To his disciples] "Sirs, what he says is right. What I said just now was only in play.
{{< /l >}}


Kung-shan Fuh-jau was in revolt against the government and was holding to his district of Pi.
- He invited the Master who showed an inclination to go. 

Tsz-Lu was averse to this:

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
You can never go, that is certain. How should you feel you must go to that person?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Well, he who has invited me must surely not have done so without a sufficient reason! 
{{< /l >}}


If my services were enlisted, I might create for him another East Chow don't you think so?"

Tsz-chang asked Confucius about the virtue of philanthropy.

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
It is the being able to put in practice 5 qualities, in any place under the sun." 

They are: dignity, indulgence, faithfulness, earnestness, kindness. 

If you show dignity you will not be mocked; if you are indulgent you will win the multitude; if faithful, men will place their trust in you; if earnest, you will do something meritorious; and if kind, you will be enabled to avail yourself amply of men's services."

Pih Hih sent the Master an invitation, and he wanted to go.

Tsz-Lu (seeing this) said to him:

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
In former days, sir, you said: 'A superior man will not enter the society of one who does not that which is good in matters concerning himself'

This man is in revolt, with Chung-man in his possession

If you go to him, how will the case stand?" 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Yes, those are indeed my words. But is it not said, 'What is hard may be rubbed without being made thin,' and 'White may be stained without being made black'?

I am surely not a gourd! How am I to be strung up like that kind of thing�and live without means?

I will tell you of the six words with their six obfuscations
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
They are these 6 virtues, cared for without care for any study about them:

1. philanthropy
2. wisdom
3. faithfulness
4. straightforwardness
5. courage
6. firmness

The 6 obfuscations resulting from not liking to learn about them are respectively: 

1. fatuity
2. mental dissipation
3. mischievousness
4. perversity
5. insubordination
6. impetuosity
