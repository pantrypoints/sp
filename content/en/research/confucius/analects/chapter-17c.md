Once Ju Pi wanted to interview Confucius who excused himself because of ill-health.

But while the attendant was passing out through the doorway with the message he took his lute and sang, in such a way as to let him hear him. 

Tsai Wo questioned him respecting the 3 years' mourning.

He replied that one full 12-month was a long time:
- If gentlemen were for 3 years to cease observing the rules of propriety, propriety would suffer.
- If for 3 years they neglected music, music must certainly die out

Nature  has taught us that when the old year's grain is finished, the new has sprung up for us.

All the changes[32] in procuring fire by friction have been gone through in the 4 seasons, then surely a 12-month might suffice. 

The Master asked him:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Would you be satisfied to return to better food and put on fine clothes?"
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Tsai-Wo" >}}
Yes 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Then do so. 

But to a gentleman, who is in mourning for a parent:
- the choicest food will not be palatable
- listening to music will not be pleasant
- the comforts of home will not make him happy in mind. 

Hence he does not do as you suggest. But if you are now happy in your mind, then do so.

Tsai-Wo went out. 

The Master went on to say:

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
This man has a lack of human feeling. 

After a child has lived 3 years, it then breaks away from the tender nursing of its parents.

This 3 years' mourning is the customary mourning prevalent all over the empire.

Can this man have enjoyed the 3 years of loving care from his parents?

Ah, it is difficult, to know what to make of those who are all day long cramming themselves with food and are without anything to apply their minds to!

Are there no dice and chess players? Better, perhaps, join in that pursuit than do nothing at all!

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
Does a gentleman make much account of bravery?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
He counts righteousness higher. A gentleman who is brave without being just may become turbulent. 

A common person who is brave and not just may end in becoming a highwayman.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
I suppose a gentleman will have his aversions as well as his likings?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Yes, he will dislike those who talk much about other people's ill-deeds.

He will dislike:
- those who, when occupying inferior places, utter defamatory words against their superiors. 
- those who, though they may be brave, have no regard for propriety
- those hastily decisive and venturesome spirits who are nevertheless so hampered by limited intellect.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
You, too, Tsz-Kung have your aversions, have you not?"
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Kung" >}}
I dislike:
- those plagiarists who wish to pass for wise persons
- those people who wish their lack of humility to be taken for bravery
- those divulgers of secrets who think to be accounted straightforward
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Of all others, servants are the most difficult people to care for. Approach them in a familiar manner, and they take liberties. Keep them at a distance, and they grumble. 

When a man meets with odium at forty, he will do so to the end.
