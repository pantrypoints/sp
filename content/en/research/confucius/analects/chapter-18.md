{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
In the reign of the last king of the Yin dynasty, there were 3 men of philanthropic spirit*:

1. The viscount of Wei, who withdrew from him
2. The viscount of Ki, who became his bondsman
3. Pi-kan, who reproved him and suffered death

Hwi of Liu-hi was the Chief Criminal Judge and was thrice dismissed.

{{< n n="Adam Smith said that before the rise of the commercial system, rulers were philantrophic because there were few ways to  sell the excess productivity of society" >}}

 

A person remarked to him, "Can you not yet bear to withdraw?" 

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
If I act in a straightforward way in serving men, whither in these days should I go, where I should not be thrice dismissed? Were I to adopt crooked ways in their service, why need I leave the land where my parents dwell?" 
{{< /l >}}

Duke King of Ts'i remarked respecting his attitude towards Confucius: 


{{< r a="Duke" >}}
"If he is to be treated like the Chief of the Ki family, I cannot do it. I should treat him as somewhere between the Ki and Mang Chiefs. I am old and not competent to avail myself of him.
{{< /r >}}


Confucius, hearing of this, went away. 

The Ts'i officials presented to the Court of Lu a number of female musicians. 

Ki Hwan accepted them. For 3 days, no Court was held.

Confucius went away. Tsieh-yu, the madman [33] of Ts'u, was once passing Confucius, singing as he went along.

He sang:

{{< r a="Tsieh-yu" >}}
Ha, the phoenix! Ha, the phoenix! How is Virtue lying prone! Vain to chide for what is o'er, Plan to meet what's yet in store. 
{{< /r >}}

<!-- {{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Let alone! Let alone! Risky now to serve a throne.
{{< /l >}} -->

Confucius alighted, wishing to talk to him. But the man hurried along and left him.

Chang-tsu and Kieh-nih [34] were working together on some ploughed land. Confucius was passing by them, and sent Tsz-Lu to ask where the ford was.

{{< r a="Chang-tsu" >}}
Who is the person driving the carriage?
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
Confucius
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Chang-tsu" >}}
Is he of Lu?
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
Yes
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Chang-tsu" >}}
He knows then where the ford is
{{< /r >}}


Tsz-Lu then asked it Kieh-nih.

{{< r a="Kieh-nih" >}}
You are a follower of Confucius of Lu, are you not? These waters rise and overflow their bounds, 'tis so with all throughout the empire; and who is he that can alter the state of things?

You are a follower of a learned man who withdraws from his chief; had you not better be a follower of such as have forsaken the world?
{{< /r >}}


He went on with his harrowing, without stopping. 

Tsz-Lu went and informed his Master of all this. 

He was deeply touched, and said:


{{< r a="Tsz-Lu" >}}
One cannot herd on equal terms with beasts and birds. 

If I am not to live among these human folk, then with whom else should I live? Only when the empire is well ordered shall I cease to take part in the work of reformation.
