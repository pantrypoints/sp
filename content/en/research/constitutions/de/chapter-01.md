Last amended by the Act of 19 December 2022

The Parliamentary Council, meeting in public session at Bonn am Rhein on 23 May 1949, confirmed that the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which was adopted by the Parliamentary Council on 8 May 1949, was ratified in the week of 16 to 22 May 1949 by the parliaments of more than two thirds of the participating German Länder.

By virtue of this fact the Parliamentary Council, represented by its Presidents, has signed and
promulgated the Basic Law.

The Basic Law is hereby published in the Federal Law Gazette pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article
145.

## Preamble

Conscious of their responsibility before God and man, Inspired by the determination to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united Europe, the German people, in the exercise of their constituent power, have adopted this Basic Law. Germans in the Länder of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland- Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.

and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of
the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall
be no censorship.

of young persons and in the right to personal honour.
(3) Arts and sciences, research and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching shall not release
any person from allegiance to the constitution.
Article 6
[Marriage – Family – Children]
(1) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the state.

upon them. The state shall watch over them in the performance of this duty.

(2) Parents and guardians shall have the right to decide whether children shall receive religious
instruction.

be obliged against their will to give religious instruction.
(4) The right to establish private schools shall be guaranteed. Private schools that serve as
alternatives to state schools shall require the approval of the state and shall be subject to the laws of
the Länder. Such approval shall be given when private schools are not inferior to the state schools in
terms of their educational aims, their facilities or the professional training of their teaching staff and
when segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents will not be encouraged thereby.
Approval shall be withheld if the economic and legal position of the teaching staff is not adequately
assured.
(5) A private elementary school shall be approved only if the education authority finds that it serves a
special educational interest or if, on the application of parents or guardians, it is to be established as a
denominational or interdenominational school or as a school based on a particular philosophy and no
state elementary school of that type exists in the municipality.
(6) Preparatory schools shall remain abolished.
Article 8

constitutional order or the concept of international understanding shall be prohibited.

economic conditions.
Article 10
[Privacy of correspondence, posts and telecommunications]
(1) The privacy of correspondence, posts and telecommunications shall be inviolable.
(2) Restrictions may be ordered only pursuant to a law. If the restriction serves to protect the free
democratic basic order or the existence or security of the Federation or of a Land, the law may provide
that the person affected shall not be informed of the restriction and that recourse to the courts shall be
replaced by a review of the case by agencies and auxiliary agencies appointed by the legislature.
Article 11
[Freedom of movement]
(1) All Germans shall have the right to move freely throughout the federal territory.
(2) This right may be restricted only by or pursuant to a law, and only in cases in which the absence of
adequate means of support would result in a particular burden for the community, or in which such
restriction is necessary to avert an imminent danger to the existence or the free democratic basic
order of the Federation or of a Land, to combat the danger of an epidemic, to respond to a grave
accident or natural disaster, to protect young persons from serious neglect or to prevent crime.
Article 12
[Occupational freedom]

and their place of training. The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or
pursuant to a law.

traditional duty of community service that applies generally and equally to all.

Article 12a
[Compulsory military and alternative civilian service]
(1) Men who have attained the age of eighteen may be required to serve in the Armed Forces, in the
Federal Border Police, or in a civil defence organisation.
(2) Any person who, on grounds of conscience, refuses to render military service involving the use of
arms may be required to perform alternative service. The duration of alternative service shall not
exceed that of military service. Details shall be regulated by a law, which shall not interfere with the
freedom to make a decision in accordance with the dictates of conscience and which shall also
provide for the possibility of alternative service not connected with units of the Armed Forces or of the
Federal Border Police.
(3) Persons liable to compulsory military service who are not called upon to render service pursuant to
paragraph (1) or (2) of this Article may, when a state of defence is in effect, be assigned by or
pursuant to a law to employment involving civilian services for defence purposes, including the
protection of the civilian population; they may be assigned to public employment only for the purpose
of discharging police functions or such other sovereign functions of public administration as can be
discharged only by persons employed in the public service. The employment contemplated by the first
sentence of this paragraph may include services within the Armed Forces, in the provision of military
supplies or with public administrative authorities; assignments to employment connected with
supplying and servicing the civilian population shall be permissible only to meet their basic
requirements or to guarantee their safety.
(4) If, during a state of defence, the need for civilian services in the civilian health system or in
stationary military hospitals cannot be met on a voluntary basis, women between the age of eighteen
and fifty-five may be called upon to render such services by or pursuant to a law. Under no
circumstances may they be required to render service involving the use of arms.

and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
(5) Prior to the existence of a state of defence, assignments under paragraph (3) of this Article may be
made only if the requirements of paragraph (1) of Article 80a are met. In preparation for the provision
of services under paragraph (3) of this Article that demand special knowledge or skills, participation in
training courses may be required by or pursuant to a law. In this case the first sentence of this
paragraph shall not apply.
(6) If, during a state of defence, the need for workers in the areas specified in the second sentence of
paragraph (3) of this Article cannot be met on a voluntary basis, the right of German citizens to
abandon their occupation or place of employment may be restricted by or pursuant to a law in order to
meet this need. Prior to the existence of a state of defence, the first sentence of paragraph (5) of this
Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis.
Article 13
[Inviolability of the home]
(1) The home is inviolable.
(2) Searches may be authorised only by a judge or, when time is of the essence, by other authorities
designated by the laws and may be carried out only in the manner therein prescribed.
(3) If particular facts justify the suspicion that any person has committed an especially serious crime
specifically defined by a law, technical means of acoustical surveillance of any home in which the
suspect is supposedly staying may be employed pursuant to judicial order for the purpose of
prosecuting the offence, provided that alternative methods of investigating the matter would be
disproportionately difficult or unproductive. The authorisation shall be for a limited time. The order shall
be issued by a panel composed of three judges. When time is of the essence, it may also be issued by
a single judge.
(4) To avert acute dangers to public safety, especially dangers to life or to the public, technical means
of surveillance of the home may be employed only pursuant to judicial order. When time is of the
essence, such measures may also be ordered by other authorities designated by a law; a judicial
decision shall subsequently be obtained without delay.
(5) If technical means are contemplated solely for the protection of persons officially deployed in a
home, the measure may be ordered by an authority designated by a law. The information thereby
obtained may be otherwise used only for purposes of criminal prosecution or to avert danger and only
if the legality of the measure has been previously determined by a judge; when time is of the essence,
a judicial decision shall subsequently be obtained without delay.
(6) The Federal Government shall report to the Bundestag annually as to the employment of technical
means pursuant to paragraph (3) and, within the jurisdiction of the Federation, pursuant to paragraph
(4) and, insofar as judicial approval is required, pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Article. A panel
elected by the Bundestag shall exercise parliamentary oversight on the basis of this report. A
comparable parliamentary oversight shall be afforded by the Länder.
(7) Interferences and restrictions shall otherwise only be permissible to avert a danger to the public or
to the life of an individual or, pursuant to a law, to confront an acute danger to public safety and order,
in particular to relieve an accommodation shortage, to combat the danger of an epidemic or to protect
young persons at risk.
Article 14
[Property – Inheritance – Expropriation]
(1) Property and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed. Their content and limits shall be defined
by the laws.
(2) Property entails obligations. Its use shall also serve the public good.
(3) Expropriation shall only be permissible for the public good. It may only be ordered by or pursuant
to a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation. Such compensation shall be
determined by establishing an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those
affected. In case of dispute concerning the amount of compensation, recourse may be had to the
ordinary courts.
Article 15
[Nationalisation]
Land, natural resources and means of production may, for the purpose of nationalisation, be
transferred to public ownership or other forms of public enterprise by a law that determines the nature
and extent of compensation. With respect to such compensation the third and fourth sentences of
paragraph (3) of Article 14 shall apply, mutatis mutandis.
Article 16
[Citizenship – Extradition]
Page 4 of 46Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice
and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
(1) No German may be deprived of his citizenship. Loss of citizenship may occur only pursuant to a
law and, if it occurs against the will of the person affected, only if he does not become stateless as a
result.
(2) No German may be extradited to a foreign country. The law may provide otherwise for extraditions
to a member state of the European Union or to an international court, provided that the rule of law is
observed.
Article 16a
[Right of asylum]
(1) Persons persecuted on political grounds shall have the right of asylum.
(2) Paragraph (1) of this Article may not be invoked by a person who enters the federal territory from a
member state of the European Communities or from another third state in which application of the
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and of the Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is assured. The states outside the European Communities to
which the conditions referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph apply shall be specified by a law
requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. In the cases specified in the first sentence of this paragraph,
measures to terminate an applicant’s stay may be implemented without regard to any legal challenge
that may have been instituted against them.
(3) By a law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat, states may be specified in which, on the basis of
their laws, enforcement practices and general political conditions, it can be safely concluded that
neither political persecution nor inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment exists. It shall be
presumed that a foreigner from such a state is not persecuted, unless he presents evidence justifying
the conclusion that, contrary to this presumption, he is persecuted on political grounds.
(4) In the cases specified by paragraph (3) of this Article and in other cases that are plainly unfounded
or considered to be plainly unfounded, the implementation of measures to terminate an applicant’s
stay may be suspended by a court only if serious doubts exist as to their legality; the scope of review
may be limited, and tardy objections may be disregarded. Details shall be determined by a law.
(5) Paragraphs (1) to (4) of this Article shall not preclude the conclusion of international agreements of
member states of the European Communities with each other or with those third states which, with
due regard for the obligations arising from the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, whose enforcement must
be assured in the contracting states, adopt rules conferring jurisdiction to decide on applications for
asylum, including the reciprocal recognition of asylum decisions.
Article 17
[Right of petition]
Every person shall have the right individually or jointly with others to address written requests or
complaints to competent authorities and to the legislature.
Article 17a
[Restriction of basic rights in specific instances]
(1) Laws regarding military and alternative service may provide that the basic right of members of the
Armed Forces and of alternative service freely to express and disseminate their opinions in speech,
writing and pictures (first clause of the first sentence of paragraph (1) of Article 5), the basic right of
assembly (Article 8) and the right of petition (Article 17), insofar as it permits the submission of
requests or complaints jointly with others, be restricted during their period of military or alternative
service.
(2) Laws regarding defence, including protection of the civilian population, may provide for restriction
of the basic rights of freedom of movement (Article 11) and inviolability of the home (Article 13).
Article 18
[Forfeiture of basic rights]
Whoever abuses the freedom of expression, in particular the freedom of the press (paragraph (1) of
Article 5), the freedom of teaching (paragraph (3) of Article 5), the freedom of assembly (Article 8), the
freedom of association (Article 9), the privacy of correspondence, posts and telecommunications
(Article 10), the rights of property (Article 14) or the right of asylum (Article 16a) in order to combat the
free democratic basic order shall forfeit these basic rights. This forfeiture and its extent shall be
declared by the Federal Constitutional Court.
Article 19
[Restriction of basic rights – Legal remedies]
Page 5 of 46Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice
and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
(1) Insofar as, under this Basic Law, a basic right may be restricted by or pursuant to a law, such law
must apply generally and not merely to a single case. In addition, the law must specify the basic right
affected and the Article in which it appears.
(2) In no case may the essence of a basic right be affected.
(3) The basic rights shall also apply to domestic legal persons to the extent that the nature of such
rights permits.
(4) Should any person’s rights be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If
no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts. The second
sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 10 shall not be affected by this paragraph.
