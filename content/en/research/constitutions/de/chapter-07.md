with this legislation with respect to:

[Bills]
Page 18 of 46Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice
and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
(1) Bills may be introduced in the Bundestag by the Federal Government, by the Bundesrat or from the
floor of the Bundestag.
(2) Federal Government bills shall first be submitted to the Bundesrat. The Bundesrat shall be entitled
to comment on such bills within six weeks. If for important reasons, especially with respect to the
scope of the bill, the Bundesrat demands an extension, the period shall be increased to nine weeks. If
in exceptional circumstances the Federal Government, on submitting a bill to the Bundesrat, declares
it to be particularly urgent, it may submit the bill to the Bundestag after three weeks or, if the
Bundesrat has demanded an extension pursuant to the third sentence of this paragraph, after six
weeks, even if it has not yet received the Bundesrat’s comments; upon receiving such comments, it
shall transmit them to the Bundestag without delay. In the case of bills to amend this Basic Law or to
transfer sovereign powers pursuant to Article 23 or 24, the comment period shall be nine weeks; the
fourth sentence of this paragraph shall not apply.
(3) Bundesrat bills shall be submitted to the Bundestag by the Federal Government within six weeks.
In submitting them the Federal Government shall state its own views. If for important reasons,
especially with respect to the scope of the bill, the Federal Government demands an extension, the
period shall be increased to nine weeks. If in exceptional circumstances the Bundesrat declares a bill
to be particularly urgent, the period shall be three weeks or, if the Federal Government has demanded
an extension pursuant to the third sentence of this paragraph, six weeks. In the case of bills to amend
this Basic Law or to transfer sovereign powers pursuant to Article 23 or 24, the comment period shall
be nine weeks; the fourth sentence of this paragraph shall not apply. The Bundestag shall consider
and vote on bills within a reasonable time.
Article 77
[Legislative procedure – Mediation Committee]
(1) Federal laws shall be adopted by the Bundestag. After their adoption the President of the
Bundestag shall forward them to the Bundesrat without delay.
(2) Within three weeks after receiving an adopted bill, the Bundesrat may demand that a committee for
joint consideration of bills, composed of Members of the Bundestag and of the Bundesrat, be
convened. The composition and proceedings of this committee shall be regulated by rules of
procedure adopted by the Bundestag and requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. The members of the
Bundesrat on this committee shall not be bound by instructions. When the consent of the Bundesrat is
required for a bill to become law, the Bundestag and the Federal Government may likewise demand
that such a committee be convened. Should the committee propose any amendment to the adopted
bill, the Bundestag shall vote on it a second time.
(2a) Insofar as its consent is required for a bill to become law, the Bundesrat, if no request has been
made pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph (2) of this Article or if the mediation proceeding has
been completed without a proposal to amend the bill, shall vote on the bill within a reasonable time.
(3) Insofar as its consent is not required for a bill to become law, the Bundesrat, once proceedings
under paragraph (2) of this Article are completed, may within two weeks object to a bill adopted by the
Bundestag. The time for objection shall begin, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph
(2) of this Article, upon receipt of the bill as re-adopted by the Bundestag, and in all other cases upon
receipt of a communication from the chairman of the committee provided for in paragraph (2) of this
Article to the effect that the committee’s proceedings have been concluded.
(4) If the objection is adopted by the majority of the votes of the Bundesrat, it may be rejected by a
decision of the majority of the Members of the Bundestag. If the Bundesrat adopted the objection by a
majority of at least two thirds of its votes, its rejection by the Bundestag shall require a two-thirds
majority, including at least a majority of the Members of the Bundestag.
Article 78
[Passage of federal laws]
A bill adopted by the Bundestag shall become law if the Bundesrat consents to it or fails to make a
demand pursuant to paragraph (2) of Article 77 or fails to enter an objection within the period
stipulated in paragraph (3) of Article 77 or withdraws such an objection or if the objection is overridden
by the Bundestag.
Article 79
[Amendment of the Basic Law]
(1) This Basic Law may be amended only by a law expressly amending or supplementing its text. In
the case of an international treaty regarding a peace settlement, the preparation of a peace settlement
or the phasing out of an occupation regime or designed to promote the defence of the Federal
Republic, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of making clear that the provisions of this Basic Law do
Page 19 of 46Service provided by the Federal Ministry of Justice
and the Federal Office of Justice ‒ www.gesetze-im-internet.de
not preclude the conclusion and entry into force of the treaty, to add language to the Basic Law that
merely makes this clarification.
(2) Any such law shall be carried by two thirds of the Members of the Bundestag and two thirds of the
votes of the Bundesrat.
(3) Amendments to this Basic Law affecting the division of the Federation into Länder, their
participation in principle in the legislative process, or the principles laid down in Articles 1 and 20 shall
be inadmissible.
Article 80
[Issuance of statutory instruments]
(1) The Federal Government, a Federal Minister or the Land governments may be authorised by a law
to issue statutory instruments. The content, purpose and scope of the authority conferred shall be
specified in the law. Each statutory instrument shall contain a statement of its legal basis. If the law
provides that such authority may be further delegated, such subdelegation shall be effected by
statutory instrument.
(2) Unless a federal law otherwise provides, the consent of the Bundesrat shall be required for
statutory instruments issued by the Federal Government or a Federal Minister regarding fees or basic
principles for the use of postal and telecommunication facilities, basic principles for levying of charges
for the use of facilities of federal railways or the construction and operation of railways, as well as for
statutory instruments issued pursuant to federal laws that require the consent of the Bundesrat or that
are executed by the Länder on federal commission or in their own right.
(3) The Bundesrat may submit to the Federal Government drafts of statutory instruments that require
its consent.
(4) Insofar as Land governments are authorised by or pursuant to federal laws to issue statutory
instruments, the Länder shall also be entitled to regulate the matter by a law.
Article 80a
[State of tension]
(1) If this Basic Law or a federal law regarding defence, including protection of the civilian population,
provides that legal provisions may be applied only in accordance with this Article, their application,
except when a state of defence has been declared, shall be permissible only after the Bundestag has
determined that a state of tension exists or has specifically approved such application. The
determination of a state of tension and specific approval in the cases mentioned in the first sentence
of paragraph (5) and the second sentence of paragraph (6) of Article 12a shall require a two-thirds
majority of the votes cast.
(2) Any measures taken pursuant to legal provisions by virtue of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be
rescinded whenever the Bundestag so demands.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this Article, the application of such legal provisions shall also be
permissible on the basis of and in accordance with a decision made by an international body within the
framework of a treaty of alliance with the approval of the Federal Government. Any measures taken
pursuant to this paragraph shall be rescinded whenever the Bundestag, by the vote of a majority of its
Members, so demands.
Article 81
[Legislative emergency]
(1) If, in the circumstances described in Article 68, the Bundestag is not dissolved, the Federal
President, at the request of the Federal Government and with the consent of the Bundesrat, may
declare a state of legislative emergency with respect to a bill, if the Bundestag rejects the bill although
the Federal Government has declared it to be urgent. The same shall apply if a bill has been rejected
although the Federal Chancellor had combined it with a motion under Article 68.
(2) If, after a state of legislative emergency has been declared, the Bundestag again rejects the bill or
adopts it in a version the Federal Government declares unacceptable, the bill shall be deemed to have
become law to the extent that it receives the consent of the Bundesrat. The same shall apply if the
Bundestag does not pass the bill within four weeks after it is reintroduced.
(3) During the term of office of a Federal Chancellor, any other bill rejected by the Bundestag may
become law in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article within a period of six months after
the first declaration of a state of legislative emergency. After the expiry of this period, no further
declaration of a state of legislative emergency may be made during the term of office of the same
Federal Chancellor.
(4) This Basic Law may neither be amended nor abrogated nor suspended in whole or in part by a law
enacted pursuant to paragraph (2) of this Article.

Article 82

(1) Laws enacted in accordance with the provisions of this Basic Law shall, after countersignature, be
certified by the Federal President and promulgated in the Federal Law Gazette. The Federal Law
Gazette may be maintained in electronic form. Statutory instruments shall be certified by the authority
that issues them. Details regarding promulgation and the form of countersignature and certification of
laws and statutory instruments shall be regulated by a federal law.
(2) Every law or statutory instrument shall specify the date on which it shall take effect. In the absence
of such a provision, it shall take effect on the fourteenth day after the day on which the Federal Law
Gazette containing it was published.
