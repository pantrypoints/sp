Article 83

[Execution by the Länder]
The Länder shall execute federal laws in their own right insofar as this Basic Law does not otherwise
provide or permit.

Article 84
[Länder administration – Federal oversight]

1. Where the Länder execute federal laws in their own right, they shall provide for the establishment of the requisite authorities and regulate their administrative procedures. If federal laws provide otherwise, the Länder may enact derogating regulations. If a Land has enacted a derogating regulation pursuant to the second sentence, subsequent federal statutory provisions regulating the organisation of authorities and their administrative procedure shall not be enacted until at least six months after their promulgation, provided that no other determination has been made with the consent of the Bundesrat. The third sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 72 shall apply, mutatis mutandis. In exceptional cases, owing to a special need for uniform federal legislation, the Federation may regulate the administrative procedure with no possibility of separate Land legislation. Such laws shall require the consent of the Bundesrat. Federal laws may not entrust municipalities and associations of municipalities with any tasks.

(2) The Federal Government, with the consent of the Bundesrat, may issue general administrative
provisions.

(3) The Federal Government shall exercise oversight to ensure that the Länder execute federal laws in
accordance with the law. For this purpose the Federal Government may send commissioners to the
highest Land authorities and, with their consent or, where such consent is refused, with the consent of
the Bundesrat, also to subordinate authorities.
(4) Should any deficiencies that the Federal Government has identified in the execution of federal laws
in the Länder not be corrected, the Bundesrat, on application of the Federal Government or of the
Land concerned, shall decide whether that Land has violated the law. The decision of the Bundesrat
may be challenged in the Federal Constitutional Court.
(5) With a view to the execution of federal laws, the Federal Government may be authorised by a
federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat to issue instructions in particular cases. They shall
be addressed to the highest Land authorities unless the Federal Government considers the matter
urgent.

Article 85
[Execution by the Länder on federal commission]

(1) Where the Länder execute federal laws on federal commission, establishment of the authorities
shall remain the concern of the Länder, except insofar as federal laws enacted with the consent of the
Bundesrat otherwise provide. Federal laws may not entrust municipalities and associations of
municipalities with any tasks.
(2) The Federal Government, with the consent of the Bundesrat, may issue general administrative
provisions. It may provide for the uniform training of civil servants and other salaried public employees.
The heads of intermediate authorities shall be appointed with its approval.
(3) The Land authorities shall be subject to instructions from the competent highest federal authorities.
Such instructions shall be addressed to the highest Land authorities unless the Federal Government
considers the matter urgent. Implementation of the instructions shall be ensured by the highest Land
authorities.
(4) Federal oversight shall extend to the legality and appropriateness of execution. For this purpose
the Federal Government may require the submission of reports and documents and send
commissioners to all authorities.

Article 86
[Federal administration]
Where the Federation executes laws through its own administrative authorities or through federal
corporations or institutions established under public law, the Federal Government shall, insofar as the
law in question makes no special stipulation, issue general administrative provisions. The Federal
Government shall provide for the establishment of the authorities insofar as the law in question does
not otherwise provide.

Article 87
[Matters]
(1) The foreign service, the federal financial administration and, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 89, the administration of federal waterways and shipping shall be conducted by federal
administrative authorities with their own administrative substructures. A federal law may establish
Federal Border Police authorities and central offices for police information and communications, for
the criminal police and for the compilation of data for purposes of protection of the constitution and of
protection against activities within the federal territory which, through the use of force or acts
preparatory to the use of force, endanger the external interests of the Federal Republic of Germany.
(2) Social insurance institutions whose jurisdiction extends beyond the territory of a single Land shall
be administered as federal corporations under public law. Social insurance institutions whose
jurisdiction extends beyond the territory of a single Land but not beyond that of three Länder shall,
notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, be administered as Land corporations under
public law, if the Länder concerned have specified which Land shall exercise supervisory authority.
(3) In addition, autonomous federal higher authorities as well as new federal corporations and
institutions under public law may be established by a federal law for matters on which the Federation
has legislative power. When the Federation is confronted with new responsibilities with respect to
matters on which it has legislative power, federal authorities at intermediate and lower levels may be
established, with the consent of the Bundesrat and of a majority of the Members of the Bundestag, in
cases of urgent need.

Article 87a
[Armed Forces]
(1) The Federation shall establish Armed Forces for purposes of defence. Their numerical strength
and general organisational structure must be shown in the budget.
(1a) For the purpose of strengthening its ability to honour its alliance obligations and its defence
capability, the Federation may establish a special trust with its own credit authorisation for a single
amount of up to 100 billion euros. Paragraph (3) of Article 109 and paragraph (2) of Article 115 shall
not apply to the credit authorisation. Details shall be regulated by a federal law.
(2) Apart from defence, the Armed Forces may be employed only to the extent expressly permitted by
this Basic Law.
(3) During a state of defence or a state of tension the Armed Forces shall have the power to protect
civilian property and to perform traffic control functions to the extent necessary to accomplish their
defence mission. Moreover, during a state of defence or a state of tension, the Armed Forces may
also be authorised to support police measures for the protection of civilian property; in this event the
Armed Forces shall cooperate with the competent authorities.
(4) In order to avert an imminent danger to the existence or free democratic basic order of the
Federation or of a Land, the Federal Government, if the conditions referred to in paragraph (2) of
Article 91 obtain and forces of the police and the Federal Border Police are insufficient, may employ
the Armed Forces to support the police and the Federal Border Police in protecting civilian property
and in combating organised armed insurgents. Any such employment of the Armed Forces shall be
discontinued if the Bundestag or the Bundesrat so demands.

Article 87b
[Federal Defence Administration]
(1) The Federal Defence Administration shall be conducted as a federal administrative authority with
its own administrative substructure. It shall have jurisdiction for personnel matters and direct
responsibility for satisfaction of the procurement needs of the Armed Forces. Responsibilities
connected with pensions for injured persons or with construction work may be assigned to the Federal
Defence Administration only by a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. Such consent
shall also be required for any laws to the extent that they empower the Federal Defence
Administration to interfere with rights of third parties; this requirement, however, shall not apply in the
case of laws regarding personnel matters.
(2) In addition, federal laws concerning defence, including recruitment for military service and
protection of the civilian population, may, with the consent of the Bundesrat, provide that they shall be
executed, wholly or in part, either by federal administrative authorities with their own administrative
substructures or by the Länder on federal commission. If such laws are executed by the Länder on
federal commission, they may, with the consent of the Bundesrat, provide that the powers vested in
the Federal Government or in the competent highest federal authorities pursuant to Article 85 be
transferred wholly or in part to federal higher authorities; in this event the law may provide that such
authorities shall not require the consent of the Bundesrat in issuing general administrative provisions
pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 85.

Article 87c
[Production and utilisation of nuclear energy]
Laws enacted under item 14 of paragraph (1) of Article 73 may, with the consent of the Bundesrat,
provide that they shall be executed by the Länder on federal commission.

Article 87d
[Air transport administration]

(1) Air transport administration shall be conducted under federal administration. Air traffic control
services may also be provided by foreign air traffic control organisations which are authorised in
accordance with European Community law.
(2) By a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat, responsibilities for air transport
administration may be delegated to the Länder acting on federal commission.

Article 87e
[Rail transport administration]
(1) Rail transport with respect to federal railways shall be administered by federal authorities.
Responsibilities for rail transport administration may be delegated by a federal law to the Länder
acting in their own right.
(2) The Federation shall discharge rail transport administration responsibilities assigned to it by a
federal law, above and beyond those regarding federal railways.
(3) Federal railways shall be operated as enterprises under private law. They shall remain the property
of the Federation to the extent that their activities embrace the construction, maintenance and
operation of the lines. The transfer of federal shares in these enterprises under the second sentence
of this paragraph shall be effected pursuant to a law; the Federation shall retain a majority of the
shares. Details shall be regulated by a federal law.
(4) The Federation shall ensure that, in developing and maintaining the federal railway system as well
as in offering services over this system, other than local passenger services, due account is taken of
the interests and especially the transportation needs of the public. Details shall be regulated by a
federal law.
(5) Laws enacted pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (4) of this Article shall require the consent of the
Bundesrat. The consent of the Bundesrat shall also be required for laws regarding the dissolution,
merger or division of federal railway enterprises, the transfer of federal railway lines to third parties or
the abandonment of such lines or affecting local passenger services.
Article 87f
[Posts and telecommunications]
(1) In accordance with a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat, the Federation shall
ensure the availability of adequate and appropriate postal and telecommunications services
throughout the federal territory.
(2) Services within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be provided as a matter of private
enterprise by the firms succeeding to the special trust Deutsche Bundespost and by other private
providers. Sovereign functions in the area of posts and telecommunications shall be discharged by
federal administrative authorities.
(3) Notwithstanding the second sentence of paragraph (2) of this Article, the Federation, by means of
a federal institution under public law, shall discharge particular responsibilities relating to the firms
succeeding to the special trust Deutsche Bundespost as prescribed by a federal law.

Article 88
[The Federal Bank – The European Central Bank]
The Federation shall establish a note-issuing and currency bank as the Federal Bank. Within the
framework of the European Union, its responsibilities and powers may be transferred to the European
Central Bank, which is independent and committed to the overriding goal of assuring price stability.

Article 89
[Federal waterways – Administration of waterways]
(1) The Federation shall be the owner of the former Reich waterways.
(2) The Federation shall administer the federal waterways through its own authorities. It shall exercise
those state functions relating to inland shipping which extend beyond the territory of a single Land,
and those functions relating to maritime shipping, which are conferred on it by a law. Insofar as federal
waterways lie within the territory of a single Land, the Federation on its application may delegate their
administration to that Land on federal commission. If a waterway touches the territory of two or more
Länder, the Federation may commission that Land which is designated by the affected Länder.
(3) In the administration, development and new construction of waterways, the requirements of land
improvement and of water management shall be assured in agreement with the Länder.
Article 90
[Federal roads and motorways]
(1) The Federation shall remain the owner of the federal motorways and other federal trunk roads.
This ownership shall be inalienable.
(2) The administration of the federal motorways shall be a matter for the federal administrative
authorities. The Federation may make use of a company under private law to discharge its
responsibilities. This company shall be in the inalienable ownership of the Federation. Third parties
shall have no direct or indirect holding in the company and its subsidiaries. Third parties shall have no
holdings in the framework of public-private partnerships in road networks comprising the entire federal
motorway network or the entire network of other federal trunk roads in a Land or significant parts of
these networks. Details shall be regulated by a federal law.
(3) The Länder, or such self-governing corporate bodies as are competent under Land law, shall
administer on federal commission the other federal trunk roads.
(4) At the request of a Land, the Federation may assume administrative responsibility for the other
federal trunk roads insofar as they lie within the territory of that Land.

Article 91
[Internal emergency]
(1) In order to avert an imminent danger to the existence or free democratic basic order of the
Federation or of a Land, a Land may call upon police forces of other Länder, or upon personnel and
facilities of other administrative authorities and of the Federal Border Police.
(2) If the Land where such danger is imminent is not itself willing or able to combat the danger, the
Federal Government may place the police in that Land and the police forces of other Länder under its
own orders and deploy units of the Federal Border Police. Any such order shall be rescinded once the
danger is removed or at any time on the demand of the Bundesrat. If the danger extends beyond the
territory of a single Land, the Federal Government, insofar as is necessary to combat such danger,
may issue instructions to the Land governments; the first and second sentences of this paragraph
shall not be affected by this provision.
