## Chapter 1: Internal Market

## Section 1: Establishment And Functioning Of The Internal Market

### Article 3-130

1. The Union shall adopt measures with the aim of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the internal market, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution. 

2. The internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of persons, services, goods and capital is ensured in accordance with the Constitution.

3. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt European regulations and decisions determining the guidelines and conditions necessary to ensure balanced progress in all the sectors concerned.

4. When drawing up its proposals for achieving the objectives set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Commission shall take into account the extent of the effort that certain economies showing differences in development will have to sustain for the establishment of the internal market and it
may propose appropriate measures.

If these measures take the form of derogations, they must be of a temporary nature and must cause the least possible disturbance to the functioning of the internal market.

### Article 3-131

Member States shall consult each other with a view to taking together the steps needed to prevent the
functioning of the internal market being affected by measures which a Member State may be called
upon to take in the event of serious internal disturbances affecting the maintenance of law and order,
in the event of war, serious international tension constituting a threat of war, or in order to carry out
obligations it has accepted for the purpose of maintaining peace and international security.

### Article 3-132

If measures taken in the circumstances referred to in Articles III-131 and III-436 have the effect of
distorting the conditions of competition in the internal market, the Commission shall, together with
the Member State concerned, examine how these measures can be adjusted to the rules laid down in
the Constitution.

By way of derogation from the procedure laid down in Articles III-360 and III-361, the Commission
or any Member State may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice if the Commission or
Member State considers that another Member State is making improper use of the powers
provided for in Articles III-131 and III-436. The Court of Justice shall give its ruling in camera.


## SECTION 2: FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND SERVICES

Subsection 1: Workers

### Article 3-133

1. Workers shall have the right to move freely within the Union.

2. Any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards
employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment shall be prohibited.

3. Workers shall have the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public
security or public health:

(a) to accept offers of employment actually made;

(b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;

(c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions
governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or
administrative action;

(d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to
conditions which shall be embodied in European regulations adopted by the Commission.

4. This Article shall not apply to employment in the public service.

### Article 3-134

European laws or framework laws shall establish the measures needed to bring about freedom of
movement for workers, as defined in Article 3-133. They shall be adopted after consultation of the
Economic and Social Committee.
Such European laws or framework laws shall aim, in particular, to:
(a) ensure close cooperation between national employment services;
(b) abolish those administrative procedures and practices and those qualifying periods in respect of
eligibility for available employment, whether resulting from national legislation or from
agreements previously concluded between Member States, the maintenance of which would form
an obstacle to liberalisation of the movement of workers;
(c) abolish all such qualifying periods and other restrictions provided for either under national
legislation or under agreements previously concluded between Member States as impose on
workers of other Member States conditions regarding the free choice of employment other than
those imposed on workers of the State concerned;
(d) set up appropriate machinery to bring offers of employment into touch with applications for
employment and to facilitate the achievement of a balance between supply and demand in the
employment market in such a way as to avoid serious threats to the standard of living and level of
employment in the various regions and industries.
Article 3-135
Member States shall, within the framework of a joint programme, encourage the exchange of young
workers.
Article 3-136
1. In the field of social security, European laws or framework laws shall establish such measures as
are necessary to bring about freedom of movement for workers by making arrangements to secure
for employed and self-employed migrant workers and their dependants:
(a) aggregation, for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefit and of calculating the
amount of benefit, of all periods taken into account under the laws of the different countries;
(b) payment of benefits to persons resident in the territories of Member States.
2. Where a member of the Council considers that a draft European law or framework law referred
to in paragraph 1 would affect fundamental aspects of its social security system, including its scope,
cost or financial structure, or would affect the financial balance of that system, it may request that the
matter be referred to the European Council. In that case, the procedure referred to in Article 3-396
shall be suspended. After discussion, the European Council shall, within four months of this
suspension, either:
(a) refer the draft back to the Council, which shall terminate the suspension of the procedure
referred to in Article 3-396, or
(b) request the Commission to submit a new proposal; in that case, the act originally proposed shall
be deemed not to have been adopted.


Subsection 2: Freedom of establishment

### Article 3-137

Within the framework of this Subsection, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited. Such prohibition shall also apply to restrictions on the setting-up of agencies, branches or subsidiaries by nationals of any Member State established in the territory of any Member State.

Nationals of a Member State shall have the right, in the territory of another Member State, to take up
and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, in particular
companies or firms within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 3-142, under the
conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the Member State where such establishment
is effected, subject to Section 4 relating to capital and payments.

### Article 3-138

1. European framework laws shall establish measures to attain freedom of establishment as regards
a particular activity. They shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.

2. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall carry out the duties devolving
upon them under paragraph 1, in particular:

(a) by according, as a general rule, priority treatment to activities where freedom of establishment
makes a particularly valuable contribution to the development of production and trade;

(b) by ensuring close cooperation between the competent authorities in the Member States in order
to ascertain the particular situation within the Union of the various activities concerned;

(c) by abolishing those administrative procedures and practices, whether resulting from national
legislation or from agreements previously concluded between Member States, the maintenance of
which would form an obstacle to freedom of establishment;

(d) by ensuring that workers from one Member State employed in the territory of another
Member State may remain in that territory for the purpose of taking up activities therein as
self‑employed persons, where they satisfy the conditions which they would be required to satisfy
if they were entering that State at the time when they intended to take up such activities;

(e) by enabling a national of one Member State to acquire and use land and buildings situated in the
territory of another Member State, insofar as this does not conflict with the principles laid down
in Article 3-227(2);

(f) by effecting the progressive abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment in every branch
of activity under consideration, both as regards the conditions for setting up agencies, branches
or subsidiaries in the territory of a Member State and as regards the conditions governing the
entry of personnel belonging to the main establishment into managerial or supervisory posts in
such agencies, branches or subsidiaries;
(g) by coordinating to the necessary extent the safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of
members and others, are required by Member States of companies or firms within the meaning of

that State are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.
European laws or framework laws may exclude certain activities from application of this Subsection.

Article 3-140

of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States providing for
special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.

2. European framework laws shall coordinate the national provisions referred to in paragraph 1.

### Article 3-141

1. European framework laws shall make it easier for persons to take up and pursue activities as self-

(b) the coordination of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in
Member States concerning the taking-up and pursuit of activities as self-employed persons.
2. In the case of the medical and allied and pharmaceutical professions, the progressive abolition of
restrictions shall be dependent upon coordination of the conditions for the exercise of such
professions in the various Member States.

### Article 3-142

Companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered
office, central administration or principal place of business within the Union shall, for the purposes
of this Subsection, be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States.
‘Companies or firms’ means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including
cooperative societies, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which
are non-profit-making.

### Article 3-143

Member States shall accord nationals of the other Member States the same treatment as their own
nationals as regards participation in the capital of companies or firms within the meaning of the
second paragraph of Article 3-142, without prejudice to the application of the other provisions of
the Constitution.
Subsection 3
Freedom to provide services

Article 3-144
Within the framework of this Subsection, restrictions on freedom to provide services within
the Union shall be prohibited in respect of nationals of Member States who are established in a
Member State other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.
European laws or framework laws may extend this Subsection to service providers who are nationals
of a third State and who are established within the Union.

### Article 3-145

Services shall be considered to be ‘services’ for the purposes of the Constitution where they are
normally provided for remuneration, insofar as they are not governed by the provisions relating to
freedom of movement for persons, goods and capital.
‘Services’ shall in particular include:

(a) activities of an industrial character;

(b) activities of a commercial character;

(c) activities of craftsmen;

(d) activities of the professions.

Without prejudice to Subsection 2 relating to freedom of establishment, the person providing a
service may, in order to do so, temporarily pursue his or her activity in the Member State where the
service is provided, under the same conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals.

### Article 3-146

1. Freedom to provide services in the field of transport shall be governed by Section 7 of Chapter III
relating to transport.

2. The liberalisation of banking and insurance services connected with movements of capital shall
be effected in step with the liberalisation of movement of capital.

### Article 3-147

1. European framework laws shall establish measures to achieve the liberalisation of a specific
service. They shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.

2. European framework laws referred to in paragraph 1 shall as a general rule give priority to those
services which directly affect production costs or the liberalisation of which helps to promote trade in
goods.

### Article 3-148

The Member States shall endeavour to undertake liberalisation of services beyond the extent required
by the European framework laws adopted pursuant to Article 3-147(1), if their general economic
situation and the situation of the economic sector concerned so permit.
To this end, the Commission shall make recommendations to the Member States concerned.

### Article 3-149
