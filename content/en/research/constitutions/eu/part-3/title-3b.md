Subsection 1: Customs union

### Article 3-151

1. The Union shall comprise a customs union which shall cover all trade in goods and which shall
involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties on imports and exports and of all
charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption of a common customs tariff in their relations with
third countries.

2. Paragraph 4 and Subsection 3 on the prohibition of quantitative restrictions shall apply to
products originating in Member States and to products coming from third countries which are in free
circulation in Member States.

3. Products coming from a third country shall be considered to be in free circulation in a
Member State if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges
having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied in that Member State, and if they have
not benefited from a total or partial drawback of such duties or charges.

4. Customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited
between Member States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.

5. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the European regulations and
decisions fixing Common Customs Tariff duties.

6. In carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this Article the Commission shall be guided by:

(a) the need to promote trade between Member States and third countries;

(b) developments in conditions of competition within the Union insofar as they lead to an
improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings;

(c) the requirements of the Union as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods; in
this connection the Commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of competition
between Member States in respect of finished goods;

(d) the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of Member States and to ensure rational
development of production and an expansion of consumption within the Union.

Subsection 2: Customs cooperation

### Article 3-152 

Within the scope of application of the Constitution, European laws or framework laws shall establish
measures in order to strengthen customs cooperation between Member States and between them and
the Commission.

Subsection 3: Prohibition of quantitative restrictions

### Article 3-153 

Quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be
prohibited between Member States.

###  Article 3-154

Article 3-153 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit
justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and
life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or
archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or
restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised
restriction on trade between Member States.

### Article 3-155

1. Member States shall adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that
no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists
between nationals of Member States.

This Article shall apply to any body through which a Member State, in law or in fact, either directly or
indirectly supervises, determines or appreciably influences imports or exports between
Member States. It shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to others.

2. Member States shall refrain from introducing any new measure which is contrary to the
principles laid down in paragraph 1 or which restricts the scope of the Articles dealing with the
prohibition of customs duties and quantitative restrictions between Member States.

3. If a State monopoly of a commercial character has rules which are designed to make it easier to
dispose of agricultural products or obtain for them the best return, steps should be taken in applying
this Article to ensure equivalent safeguards for the employment and standard of living of the
producers concerned.
