### Article 3-170

1. No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any
internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic
products.

Furthermore, no Member State shall impose on the products of other Member States any internal
taxation of such a nature as to afford indirect protection to other products.

2. Where products are exported by a Member State to the territory of another Member State, any
repayment of internal taxation shall not exceed the internal taxation imposed on them whether
directly or indirectly.

3. In the case of charges other than turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect
taxation, remissions and repayments in respect of exports to other Member States may not be granted
and countervailing charges in respect of imports from Member States may not be imposed unless the
provisions contemplated have been previously approved for a limited period by a European decision
adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.

### Article 3-171

A European law or framework law of the Council shall establish measures for the harmonisation of
legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation provided that
such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal
market and to avoid distortion of competition. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting
the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.

SECTION 7: COMMON PROVISIONS

#### Article 3-172

1. Save where otherwise provided in the Constitution, this Article shall apply for the achievement
of the objectives set out in Article 3-130. European laws or framework laws shall establish measures
for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in
Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Such laws shall be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to fiscal provisions, to those relating to the free movement of
persons or to those relating to the rights and interests of employed persons.
3. The Commission, in its proposals submitted under paragraph 1 concerning health, safety,
environmental protection and consumer protection, shall take as a base a high level of protection,
taking account in particular of any new development based on scientific facts. Within their respective
powers, the European Parliament and the Council shall also seek to achieve this objective.
4. If, after the adoption of a harmonisation measure by means of a European law or framework law
or by means of a European regulation of the Commission, a Member State deems it necessary to
maintain national provisions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 3-154, or relating to
the protection of the environment or the working environment, it shall notify the Commission of
these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them.
5. Moreover, without prejudice to paragraph 4, if, after the adoption of a harmonisation measure
by means of a European law or framework law or by means of a European regulation of the
Commission, a Member State deems it necessary to introduce national provisions based on new
scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment on
grounds of a problem specific to that Member State arising after the adoption of the harmonisation
measure, it shall notify the Commission of the envisaged provisions and the reasons for them.
6. The Commission shall, within six months of the notifications referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,
adopt a European decision approving or rejecting the national provisions involved after having
verified whether or not they are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on
trade between Member States and whether or not they constitute an obstacle to the functioning of
the internal market.
In the absence of a decision by the Commission within this period the national provisions referred to
in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be deemed to have been approved.
When justified by the complexity of the matter and in the absence of danger to human health, the
Commission may notify the Member State concerned that the period referred to in this paragraph
will be extended for a further period of up to six months.
7. When, pursuant to paragraph 6, a Member State is authorised to maintain or introduce national
provisions derogating from a harmonisation measure, the Commission shall immediately examine
whether to propose an adaptation to that measure.
8. When a Member State raises a specific problem on public health in a field which has been the
subject of prior harmonisation measures, it shall bring it to the attention of the Commission which
shall immediately examine whether to propose appropriate measures.
9. By way of derogation from the procedure laid down in Articles III-360 and III-361, the
Commission and any Member State may bring the matter directly before the Court of Justice of the
European Union if it considers that another Member State is making improper use of the powers
provided for in this Article.
10. The harmonisation measures referred to in this Article shall, in appropriate cases, include a
safeguard clause authorising the Member States to take, for one or more of the non‑economic
reasons referred to in Article 3-154, provisional measures subject to a Union control procedure.

Article 3-173

Without prejudice to Article 3-172, a European framework law of the Council shall establish
measures for the approximation of such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the
Member States as directly affect the establishment or functioning of the internal market. The Council
shall act unanimously after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social
Committee.

Article 3-174
Where the Commission finds that a difference between the provisions laid down by law, regulation or
administrative action in Member States is distorting the conditions of competition in the
internal market and that the resultant distortion needs to be eliminated, it shall consult the
Member States concerned.

If such consultation does not result in agreement, European framework laws shall establish the
measures necessary to eliminate the distortion in question. Any other appropriate measures provided
for in the Constitution may be adopted.

Article 3-175
1. Where there is reason to fear that the adoption or amendment of a provision laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action of a Member State may cause distortion within the meaning of
Article 3-174, a Member State desiring to proceed therewith shall consult the Commission. After
consulting the Member States, the Commission shall address to the Member States concerned a
recommendation on such measures as may be appropriate to avoid the distortion in question.
2. If a Member State desiring to introduce or amend its own provisions does not comply with
the recommendation addressed to it by the Commission, other Member States shall not be required,
pursuant to Article 3-174, to amend their own provisions in order to eliminate such distortion. If the
Member State which has ignored the recommendation of the Commission causes distortion
detrimental only to itself, Article 3-174 shall not apply.
Article 3-176
In the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market, European laws or
framework laws shall establish measures for the creation of European intellectual property rights to
provide uniform intellectual property rights protection throughout the Union and for the setting up
of centralised Union‑wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements.
A European law of the Council shall establish language arrangements for the European intellectual
property rights. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting the European Parliament.
