Article 3-209

The Union and the Member States, having in mind fundamental social rights such as those set out in
the European Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community
Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, shall have as their objectives the promotion of
employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation
while the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, dialogue between management
and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the
combating of exclusion.

To this end the Union and the Member States shall act taking account of the diverse forms of national
practices, in particular in the field of contractual relations, and the need to maintain the
competitiveness of the Union economy.
They believe that such a development will ensue not only from the functioning of the internal
market, which will favour the harmonisation of social systems, but also from the procedures
provided for in the Constitution and from the approximation of provisions laid down by law,
regulation or administrative action of the Member States.

Article 3-210
1. With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 3-209, the Union shall support and
complement the activities of the Member States in the following fields:
(a) improvement in particular of the working environment to protect workers' health and safety;
(b) working conditions;
(c) social security and social protection of workers;
(d) protection of workers where their employment contract is terminated;
(e) the information and consultation of workers;
(f) representation and collective defence of the interests of workers and employers, including co-
determination, subject to paragraph 6;
(g) conditions of employment for third-country nationals legally residing in Union territory;
(h) the integration of persons excluded from the labour market, without prejudice to Article 3-283;
(i) equality between women and men with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment
at work;
(j) the combating of social exclusion;
(k) the modernisation of social protection systems without prejudice to point (c).

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:
(a) European laws or framework laws may establish measures designed to encourage cooperation
between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges
of information and best practices, promoting innovative approaches and evaluating experiences,
excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States;
(b) in the fields referred to in paragraph 1(a) to (i), European framework laws may establish
minimum requirements for gradual implementation, having regard to the conditions and
technical rules obtaining in each of the Member States. Such European framework laws shall
avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back
the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.
In all cases, such European laws or framework laws shall be adopted after consultation of the
Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, in the fields referred to in paragraph 1(c), (d), (f) and (g),
European laws or framework laws shall be adopted by the Council acting unanimously after
consulting the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social
Committee.
The Council may, on a proposal from the Commission, adopt a European decision making the
ordinary legislative procedure applicable to paragraph 1(d), (f) and (g). It shall act unanimously after
consulting the European Parliament.
4. A Member State may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the
implementation of European framework laws adopted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 or, where
appropriate, with the implementation of European regulations or decisions adopted in accordance
with Article 3-212.
In this case, it shall ensure that, no later than the date on which a European framework law must be
transposed, or a European regulation or decision implemented, management and labour have
introduced the necessary measures by agreement, the Member State concerned being required to take
any necessary measure enabling it at any time to be in a position to guarantee the results imposed by
that framework law, regulation or decision.
5.
The European laws and framework laws adopted pursuant to this Article:
(a) shall not affect the right of Member States to define the fundamental principles of their
social security systems and must not significantly affect the financial equilibrium of such systems;
(b) shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective
measures compatible with the Constitution.
6. This Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to
impose lockouts.

Article 3-211

1. The Commission shall promote the consultation of management and labour at Union level and
shall adopt any relevant measure to facilitate their dialogue by ensuring balanced support for the
parties.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, before submitting proposals in the social policy field, the
Commission shall consult management and labour on the possible direction of Union action.
3. If, after the consultation referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission considers Union action
desirable, it shall consult management and labour on the content of the envisaged proposal.
Management and labour shall forward to the Commission an opinion or, where appropriate, a
recommendation.
4. On the occasion of the consultation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, management and labour
may inform the Commission of their wish to initiate the process provided for in Article 3-212(1).
The duration of this process shall not exceed nine months, unless the management and labour
concerned and the Commission decide jointly to extend it.
Article 3-212
1. Should management and labour so desire, the dialogue between them at Union level may lead to
contractual relations, including agreements.
2. Agreements concluded at Union level shall be implemented either in accordance with the
procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters
covered by Article 3-210, at the joint request of the signatory parties, by European regulations or
decisions adopted by the Council on a proposal from the Commission. The European Parliament
shall be informed.
Where the agreement in question contains one or more provisions relating to one of the areas for
which unanimity is required pursuant to Article 3-210(3), the Council shall act unanimously.
Article 3-213
With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 3-209 and without prejudice to the other
provisions of the Constitution, the Commission shall encourage cooperation between the
Member States and facilitate the coordination of their action in all social policy fields under this
Section, particularly in matters relating to:
(a) employment;
(b) labour law and working conditions;
(c) basic and advanced vocational training;
(d) social security;
(e) prevention of occupational accidents and diseases
(f) occupational hygiene;
(g) the right of association and collective bargaining between employers and workers.
To this end, the Commission shall act in close contact with Member States by making studies,
delivering opinions and arranging consultations both on problems arising at national level and on
those of concern to international organisations, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of
guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the
necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept
fully informed.

Before delivering the opinions provided for in this Article, the Commission shall consult the
Economic and Social Committee.

Article 3-214
1. Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for female and male workers for
equal work or work of equal value is applied.
2. For the purpose of this Article, ‘pay’ means the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and
any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly,
in respect of his employment, from his employer.
Equal pay without discrimination based on sex means:
(a) that pay for the same work at piece rates shall be calculated on the basis of the same unit of
measurement;
(b) that pay for work at time rates shall be the same for the same job.
3. European laws or framework laws shall establish measures to ensure the application of the
principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of women and men in matters of employment
and occupation, including the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. They shall
be adopted after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.
4. With a view to ensuring full equality in practice between women and men in working life, the
principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or adopting
measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to
pursue a vocational activity, or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.
Article 3-215
Member States shall endeavour to maintain the existing equivalence between paid holiday schemes.

Article 3-216

The Commission shall draw up a report each year on progress in achieving the objectives of
Article 3-209, including the demographic situation within the Union. It shall forward the report to
the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.
Article 3-217
The Council shall, by a simple majority, adopt a European decision establishing a Social Protection
Committee with advisory status to promote cooperation on social protection policies between
Member States and with the Commission. The Council shall act after consulting the
European Parliament.
The tasks of the Committee shall be:
(a) to monitor the social situation and the development of social protection policies in the Member
States and within the Union;
(b) to promote exchanges of information, experience and good practice between Member States and
with the Commission;
(c) without prejudice to Article 3-344, to prepare reports, formulate opinions or undertake other
work within the scope of its powers, at the request of either the Council or the Commission or on
its own initiative.
In fulfilling its mandate, the Committee shall establish appropriate contacts with management and
labour.
Each Member State and the Commission shall appoint two members of the Committee.
Article 3-218
The Commission shall include a separate chapter on social developments within the Union in its
annual report to the European Parliament.
The European Parliament may invite the Commission to draw up reports on any particular problems
concerning social conditions.

contribute thereby to raising the standard of living, a European Social Fund is hereby established; it
