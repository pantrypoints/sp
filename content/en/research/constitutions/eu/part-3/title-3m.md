SECTION 4: AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES

Article 3-225

The Union shall define and implement a common agriculture and fisheries policy.
‘Agricultural products’ means the products of the soil, of stockfarming and of fisheries and products
of first-stage processing directly related to these products. References to the common agricultural
policy or to agriculture, and the use of the term ‘agricultural’, shall be understood as also referring to
fisheries, having regard to the specific characteristics of this sector.

Article 3-226
1. The internal market shall extend to agriculture and trade in agricultural products.
2. Save as otherwise provided in articles III-227 to III-232, the rules laid down for the
establishment and functioning of the internal market shall apply to agricultural products.
3. The products listed in Annex I shall be subject to Articles III-227 to III-232.
4. The operation and development of the internal market for agricultural products must be
accompanied by a common agricultural policy.

Article 3-227
1. The objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be:
(a) to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational
development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production,
in particular labour;
(b) thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing
the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;
(c) to stabilise markets;
(d) to assure the availability of supplies;
(e) to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.
2. In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods for its application,
account shall be taken of:
(a) the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture
and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;
(b) the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees;
(c) the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy
as a whole.

Article 3-228
1. In order to attain the objectives set out in Article 3-227, a common organisation of agricultural
markets shall be established.

This organisation shall take one of the following forms, depending on the product concerned:
(a) common rules on competition;
(b) compulsory coordination of the various national market organisations;
(c) a European market organisation.
2. The common organisation established in accordance with paragraph 1 may include all measures
required to attain the objectives set out in Article 3-227, in particular regulation of prices, aids for
the production and marketing of the various products, storage and carryover arrangements and
common machinery for stabilising imports or exports.
The common organisation shall be limited to pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 3-227 and
shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Union.
Any common price policy shall be based on common criteria and uniform methods of calculation.
3. In order to enable the common organisation referred to in paragraph 1 to attain its objectives,
one or more agricultural guidance and guarantee funds may be set up.

Article 3-229

To enable the objectives set out in Article 3-227 to be attained, provision may be made within the
framework of the common agricultural policy for measures such as:
(a) an effective coordination of efforts in the spheres of vocational training, of research and of the
dissemination of agricultural knowledge; this may include joint financing of projects or
institutions;
(b) joint measures to promote consumption of certain products.
Article 3-230
1. The Section relating to rules on competition shall apply to production of and trade in
agricultural products only to the extent determined by European laws or framework laws in
accordance with Article 3-231(2), having regard to the objectives set out in Article 3-227.
2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt a European regulation or decision
authorising the granting of aid:
(a) for the protection of enterprises handicapped by structural or natural conditions;
(b) within the framework of economic development programmes.
Article 3-231
1. The Commission shall submit proposals for working out and implementing the common
agricultural policy, including the replacement of the national organisations by one of the forms of
common organisation provided for in Article 3-228(1), and for implementing the measures referred
to in this Section.

These proposals shall take account of the interdependence of the agricultural matters referred to in
this Section.
2. European laws or framework laws shall establish the common organisation of the market
provided for in Article 3-228(1) and the other provisions necessary for the pursuit of the objectives
of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. They shall be adopted after
consultation of the Economic and Social Committee.
3. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the European regulations or
decisions on fixing prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations and on the fixing and allocation of
fishing opportunities.
4. In accordance with paragraph 2, the national market organisations may be replaced by the
common organisation provided for in Article 3-228(1) if:
(a) the common organisation offers Member States which are opposed to this measure and which
have an organisation of their own for the production in question equivalent safeguards for the
employment and standard of living of the producers concerned, account being taken of the
adjustments that will be possible and the specialisation that will be needed with the passage of
time, and
(b) such an organisation ensures conditions for trade within the Union similar to those existing in a
national market.
5. If a common organisation for certain raw materials is established before a common organisation
exists for the corresponding processed products, such raw materials as are used for processed
products intended for export to third countries may be imported from outside the Union.
Article 3-232
Where in a Member State a product is subject to a national market organisation or to internal rules
having equivalent effect which affect the competitive position of similar production in another
Member State, a countervailing charge shall be applied by Member States to imports of this product
coming from the Member State where such organisation or rules exist, unless that State applies a
countervailing charge on export.
The Commission shall adopt European regulations or decisions fixing the amount of these charges at
the level required to redress the balance. It may also authorise other measures, the conditions and
details of which it shall determine.
