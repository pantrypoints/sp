Article 9

The European Parliament and national Parliaments shall together determine the organisation and
promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation within the Union.

Article 10

A conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs may submit any contribution it deems
appropriate for the attention of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. That
conference shall in addition promote the exchange of information and best practice between national
Parliaments and the European Parliament, including their special committees. It may also organise
interparliamentary conferences on specific topics, in particular to debate matters of common foreign
and security policy, including common security and defence policy. Contributions from the
conference shall not bind national Parliaments and shall not prejudge their positions.
