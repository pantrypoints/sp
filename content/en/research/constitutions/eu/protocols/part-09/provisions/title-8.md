with the internal market provided that:

(a) the period provided for in Article 8(4) of Protocol 2 on ECSC products to the Europe Agreement
establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the
one part, and Poland, of the other part ( 1 ), has been extended until 1 May 2004,

(b) the terms set out in the restructuring plan, on the basis of which the abovementioned Protocol
was extended are adhered to throughout the period 2002—2006,

referred to as ‘benefiting companies’), and in line with the conditions set out in this Title, shall be
completed no later than 31 December 2006 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the end of the restructuring
period’).

3. Only benefiting companies shall be eligible for State aid in the framework of the Polish steel
restructuring programme.

4. A benefiting company may not:

(a) in the case of a merger with a company not included in Annex 1 to Protocol 8 to the Act of
Accession of 16 April 2003, pass on the benefit of the aid granted to the benefiting company;

(b) take over the assets of any company not included in Annex 1 to Protocol 8 to the Act of
Accession of 16 April 2003 which is declared bankrupt in the period up to 31 December 2006.

5. Any subsequent privatisation of any of the benefiting companies shall take place on a basis that
respects the need for transparency and shall respect the conditions and principles regarding viability,
State aids and capacity reduction defined in this Title. No further State aid shall be granted as part of
the sale of any company or individual assets.

6. The restructuring aid granted to the benefiting companies shall be determined by the
justifications set out in the approved Polish steel restructuring plan and individual business plans as
approved by the Council. But, in any case, the aid paid out in the period of 1997‑2003 in its total
amount shall not exceed PLN 3 387 070 000.

Of this total figure:

(a) as regards Polskie Huty Stali (hereinafter referred to as ‘PHS’), the restructuring aid already granted
or to be granted from 1997 until the end of 2003 shall not exceed PLN 3 140 360 000. PHS has
already received PLN 62 360 000 of restructuring aid in the period 1997‑2001; it shall receive
further restructuring aid of no more than PLN 3 078 000 000 in 2002 and 2003 depending on
the requirements set out in the approved restructuring plan (to be entirely paid out in 2002 if the
extension of the grace period under Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement establishing an
association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and
Poland, of the other part, is granted by the end of 2002, or otherwise in 2003);

of 2003 shall not exceed PLN 246 710 000. These firms have already received PLN 37 160 000
of restructuring aid in the period 1997‑2001; they shall receive further restructuring aid of no
more than PLN 210 210 000 depending on the requirements set out in the approved restructuring plan (of which PLN 182 170 000 in 2002 and PLN 27 380 000 in 2003 if the
extension of the grace period under Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement establishing an
association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and
Poland, of the other part, is granted by the end of 2002, or otherwise PLN 210 210 000 in
2003).

No further State aid shall be granted by Poland for restructuring purposes to the Polish steel
industry.

7. The net capacity reduction to be achieved by Poland for finished products during the period
1997‑2006 shall be a minimum of 1 231 000 tonnes. This overall amount includes net capacity
reductions of at least 715 000 tpy in hot‑rolled products and 716 000 tpy in cold‑rolled products, as
well as an increase of at most 200 000 tpy of other finished products.
Capacity reduction shall be measured only on the basis of permanent closure of production facilities
by physical destruction such that the facilities cannot be restored to service. A declaration of
bankruptcy of a steel company shall not qualify as capacity reduction.

The net capacity reductions shown in Annex 2 to Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April
2003 are minima and actual net capacity reductions to be achieved and the time frame for doing so
shall be established on the basis of Poland's final restructuring programme and individual business

and their Member States, of the one part, and Poland, of the other part, taking into account the
objective to ensure the viability of benefiting companies as at 31 December 2006.

8. The business plan for the benefiting company PHS shall be implemented. In particular:

and on the basis of sound market economy principles.

12. The Commission and the Council shall closely monitor the implementation of the restructuring
and the fulfilment of the conditions set out in this Title concerning viability, State aid and capacity
reductions before and after 1 May 2004, until the end of the restructuring period, in accordance with
paragraphs 13 to 18. For this purpose the Commission shall report to the Council.

13. In addition to the monitoring of State aid, the Commission and the Council shall monitor the
restructuring benchmarks set out in Annex 3 to Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003.
References made in that Annex to paragraph 14 of the Protocol shall be construed as being made to
paragraph 14 of this Article.

14. Monitoring shall include an independent evaluation to be carried out in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The Commission's viability test shall be applied and productivity shall be measured as part of

15. Poland shall cooperate fully with all the arrangements for monitoring. In particular:

(a) Poland shall supply the Commission with six‑monthly reports concerning the restructuring of
the benefiting companies, no later than 15 March and 15 September of each year, until the end of
the restructuring period;

(b) the first report shall reach the Commission by 15 March 2003 and the last report by 15 March
2007, unless the Commission decides otherwise;

(c) the reports shall contain all the information necessary to monitor the restructuring process, the
State aid and the reduction and use of capacity and shall provide sufficient financial data to allow
an assessment to be made of whether the conditions and requirements contained in this Title have been fulfilled. The reports shall at the least contain the information set out in Annex 4 to
Protocol 8 to the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003, which the Commission reserves the right to
modify in line with its experiences during the monitoring process. In Annex 4 to Protocol 8 to
the Act of Accession of 16 April 2003, the reference to paragraph 14 of the Protocol shall be

monitoring results, undertake any research necessary and report to the Commission and the Council.

17. If the Commission establishes, on the basis of the monitoring, that substantial deviations from
the financial data on which the viability assessment has been made have occurred, it may require
Poland to take appropriate measures to reinforce or modify the restructuring measures of the
benefiting companies concerned.

18. Should the monitoring show that:

(a) the conditions for the transitional arrangements contained in this Title have not been fulfilled, or
that

(b) the commitments made in the framework of the extension of the period during which Poland
may exceptionally grant State support for the restructuring of its steel industry under the Europe
Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member
States, of the one part, and Poland, of the other part, have not been fulfilled, or that

(c) Poland in the course of the restructuring period has granted additional incompatible State aid to
the steel industry and to the benefiting companies in particular, the transitional arrangements
contained in this Title shall not have effect.

The Commission shall take appropriate steps requiring any company concerned to reimburse any aid
granted in breach of the conditions laid down in this Title.
