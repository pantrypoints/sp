## 17. PROTOCOL ON THE SCHENGEN ACQUIS INTEGRATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU

<!-- THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECALLING that the provisions of the Schengen acquis consisting of the Agreements on the gradual abolition of checks
at common borders, signed by some Member States of the European Union in Schengen on 14 June 1985 and on
19 June 1990, as well as related agreements and rules adopted on the basis of these agreements, have been integrated
into the framework of the European Union by a Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty
establishing the European Community;

DESIRING to preserve the Schengen acquis, as developed since the entry into force of the abovementioned Protocol,
within the framework of the Constitution, and to develop this acquis in order to contribute towards achieving the
objective of offering citizens of the Union an area of freedom, security and justice without internal borders;
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the special position of Denmark;
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the fact that Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland do not
participate in all the provisions of the Schengen acquis; provision should, however, be made to allow those Member
States to accept other provisions of this acquis in full or in part;
RECOGNISING that, as a consequence, it is necessary to make use of the provisions of the Constitution concerning
closer cooperation between some Member States;
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the need to maintain a special relationship with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of
Norway, both States being bound by the provisions of the Nordic passport union, together with the Nordic States which
are members of the European Union;
