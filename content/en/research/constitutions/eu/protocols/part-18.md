The United Kingdom shall be entitled, notwithstanding Articles III-130 and III-265 of the
Constitution, any other provision of the Constitution, any measure adopted under the Constitution,
or any international agreement concluded by the Union or by the Union and its Member States with
one or more third States, to exercise at its frontiers with other Member States such controls on
persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom as it may consider necessary for the purpose:

(a) of verifying the right to enter the United Kingdom of citizens of Member States and of their
dependants exercising rights conferred by Union law, as well as citizens of other States on whom
such rights have been conferred by an agreement by which the United Kingdom is bound; and

(b) of determining whether or not to grant other persons permission to enter the United Kingdom.

Accordingly, as long as they maintain such arrangements, the provisions of Article 1 of this Protocol
shall apply to Ireland under the same terms and conditions as for the United Kingdom. Nothing in
Articles III-130 and III-265 of the Constitution, in any other provision of the Constitution or in any
measure adopted under it shall affect any such arrangements.
