<!-- THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECALLING the decision of the Heads of State or Government, meeting within the European Council at Edinburgh on
12 December 1992, concerning certain problems raised by Denmark on the Treaty on European Union;
HAVING NOTED the position of Denmark with regard to citizenship, economic and monetary union, defence policy,
and justice and home affairs as laid down in the Edinburgh decision;
CONSCIOUS of the fact that a continuation under the Constitution of the legal regime originating in the Edinburgh
decision will significantly limit Denmark's participation in important areas of cooperation of the Union, and that it
would be in the best interest of the Union to ensure the integrity of the acquis in the area of freedom, security and
justice;
WISHING therefore to establish a legal framework that will provide an option for Denmark to participate in the
adoption of measures proposed on the basis of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution and welcoming the
intention of Denmark to avail itself of this option when possible in accordance with its constitutional requirements;
NOTING that Denmark will not prevent the other Member States from further developing their cooperation with
respect to measures not binding on Denmark;
BEARING IN MIND the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Constitution: -->

## PART I

### Article 1

Denmark shall not take part in the adoption by the Council of proposed measures pursuant to
Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution. The unanimity of the members of the Council,
with the exception of the representative of the government of Denmark, shall be necessary for the
acts of the Council which must be adopted unanimously.

For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members
of the Council representing the participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the
population of these States.

A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of Council members representing
more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one member, failing
which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.

By way of derogation from the second and third paragraphs, where the Council does not act on a
proposal from the Commission or from the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, the required qualified
majority shall be defined as at least 72 % of the members of the Council representing the
participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.

### Article 2

None of the provisions of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution, no measure adopted
pursuant to that Chapter, no provision of any international agreement concluded by the Union
pursuant to that Chapter, and no decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting
any such provision or measure shall be binding upon or applicable in Denmark; and no such
provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the competences, rights and obligations of
Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the Community or
Union acquis nor form part of Union law as they apply to Denmark.

### Article 3

Denmark shall bear no financial consequences of measures referred to in Article 1, other than
administrative costs entailed for the institutions.

Article 4

1. Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the adoption of a measure to build upon the Schengen acquis covered by Part I whether it will implement this measure in its national law. If it decides to do so, this measure will create an obligation under international law between
Denmark and the other Member States bound by the measure.

If Denmark decides not to implement such a measure, the Member States bound by that measure and
Denmark will consider appropriate measures to be taken.

2. Denmark shall maintain the rights and obligations existing before the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe with regard to the Schengen acquis.


## PART 2

### Article 5

With regard to measures adopted by the Council pursuant to Article I-41, Article 3-295(1) and
Articles III-309 to III-313 of the Constitution, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and
the implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. Therefore
Denmark shall not participate in their adoption. Denmark will not prevent the other Member States
from further developing their cooperation in this area. Denmark shall not be obliged to contribute to
the financing of operational expenditure arising from such measures, nor to make military
capabilities available to the Union.

The unanimity of the members of the Council, with the exception of the representative of the
government of Denmark, shall be necessary for the acts of the Council which must be adopted
unanimously.

For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members
of the Council representing the participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the
population of these States.

A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of Council members representing
more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one member, failing
which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.
By way of derogation from the third and fourth paragraphs, where the Council does not act on a
proposal from the Commission or from the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, the required qualified
majority shall be defined as at least 72 % of the members of the Council representing the
participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.


## PART 3

### Article 6

This Protocol shall also apply to measures remaining in force by virtue of Article IV-438 of the
Constitution, which were covered, prior to the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe, by the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on
European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Article 7
Articles 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply to measures determining the third countries whose nationals must
be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States, or measures
relating to a uniform format for visas.


## PART 4

### Article 8

At any time Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, inform the other
Member States that it no longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this Protocol. In that event,
Denmark will apply in full all relevant measures then in force taken within the framework of the
Union.

### Article 9

1. At any time and without prejudice to Article 8, Denmark may, in accordance with its
constitutional requirements, notify the other Member States that, with effect from the first day of the
month following the notification, Part I shall consist of the provisions in the Annex. In that case
Articles 5 to 9 shall be renumbered in consequence.

2. Six months after the date on which the notification referred to in paragraph 1 takes effect all
Schengen acquis and measures adopted to build upon this acquis, which until then have been binding
on Denmark as obligations under international law, shall be binding upon Denmark as Union law.

further proposal or initiative aiming to build upon that measure to the extent that such proposal or
initiative builds upon the Schengen acquis.
