RECALLING that the Union is pursuing a common foreign and security policy based on the achievement of growing
convergence of action by Member States;
RECALLING that the common security and defence policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security

security and defence policy of certain Member States;
RECALLING that the common security and defence policy of the Union respects the obligations under the North
Atlantic Treaty of those Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, which remains the foundation of the collective defence of its members, and is compatible with the
common security and defence policy established within that framework;
CONVINCED that a more assertive Union role in security and defence matters will contribute to the vitality of a
renewed Atlantic Alliance, in accordance with the Berlin Plus arrangements;
DETERMINED to ensure that the Union is capable of fully assuming its responsibilities within the international
community;
RECOGNISING that the United Nations Organisation may request the Union's assistance for the urgent implementation
of missions undertaken under Chapters VI and VII of the United Nations Charter;
RECOGNISING that the strengthening of the security and defence policy will require efforts by Member States in the
area of capabilities;
CONSCIOUS that embarking on a new stage in the development of the European security and defence policy involves a
determined effort by the Member States concerned;
RECALLING the importance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs being fully involved in proceedings relating to
permanent structured cooperation,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Constitution: -->

### Article 1

The permanent structured cooperation referred to in Article I‑41(6) of the Constitution shall be open
to any Member State which undertakes, from the date of entry into force of the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe, to:

(a) proceed more intensively to develop its defence capacities through the development of its
national contributions and participation, where appropriate, in multinational forces, in the main
European equipment programmes, and in the activity of the Agency in the field of defence
capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments (European Defence Agency), and
(b) have the capacity to supply by 2007 at the latest, either at national level or as a component of
multinational force groups, targeted combat units for the missions planned, structured at a
tactical level as a battle group, with support elements including transport and logistics, capable of
carrying out the tasks referred to in Article 3‑309, within a period of 5 to 30 days, in particular
in response to requests from the United Nations Organisation, and which can be sustained for an
initial period of 30 days and be extended up to at least 120 days.

Article 2

To achieve the objectives laid down in Article 1, Member States participating in permanent structured
cooperation shall undertake to:

(a) cooperate, as from the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, with a
view to achieving approved objectives concerning the level of investment expenditure on defence
equipment, and regularly review these objectives, in the light of the security environment and of
the Union's international responsibilities;

(b) bring their defence apparatus into line with each other as far as possible, particularly by
harmonising the identification of their military needs, by pooling and, where appropriate,
specialising their defence means and capabilities, and by encouraging cooperation in the fields of
training and logistics;

(c) take concrete measures to enhance the availability, interoperability, flexibility and deployability of
their forces, in particular by identifying common objectives regarding the commitment of forces,
including possibly reviewing their national decision‑making procedures;

(d) work together to ensure that they take the necessary measures to make good, including through
multinational approaches, and without prejudice to undertakings in this regard within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the shortfalls perceived in the framework of the ‘Capability
Development Mechanism’;

(e) take part, where appropriate, in the development of major joint or European equipment
programmes in the framework of the European Defence Agency.


### Article 3

States' contributions with regard to capabilities, in particular contributions made in accordance with
the criteria to be established, inter alia, on the basis of Article 2, and shall report thereon at least once
a year. The assessment may serve as a basis for Council recommendations and European decisions
adopted in accordance with Article 3‑312 of the Constitution.
