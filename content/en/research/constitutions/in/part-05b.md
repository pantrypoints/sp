(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that it provides for the imposition of
fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services
rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of
any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.

of the People thereon shall be final.

return the Bill if it is not a Money Bill to the Houses with a message requesting that they will reconsider
the Bill or any specified provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing
any such amendments as he may recommend in his message, and when a Bill is so returned, the Houses
shall reconsider the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again by the Houses with or without

113. Procedure in Parliament with respect to estimates.—(1) So much of the estimates as relates to
expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament,
but nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the discussion in either House of Parliament of
any of those estimates.

therein.
(3) No demand for a grant shall be made except on the recommendation of the President.
114. Appropriation Bills.—(1) As soon as may be after the grants under article 113 have been made

(a) the grants so made by the House of the People; and
(b) the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India but not exceeding in any case the
amount shown in the statement previously laid before Parliament.
(2) No amendment shall be proposed to any such Bill in either House of Parliament which will have
the effect of varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant so made or of varying the amount
of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, and the decision of the person presiding as
to whether an amendment is inadmissible under this clause shall be final.
(3) Subject to the provisions of articles 115 and 116, no money shall be withdrawn from the
Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law passed in accordance with the
provisions of this article.
115. Supplementary, additional or excess grants.—(1) The President shall—
(a) if the amount authorised by any law made in accordance with the provisions of article 114 to
be expended for a particular service for the current financial year is found to be insufficient for the

1. Subs. by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, s. 29 and Sch., for “a Province corresponding to a State specified in

55additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual financial statement for
that year, or
(b) if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount
granted for that service and for that year,
cause to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament another statement showing the estimated amount of
that expenditure or cause to be presented to the House of the People a demand for such excess, as the case
may be.
(2) The provisions of articles 112, 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to any such statement and
expenditure or demand and also to any law to be made authorising the appropriation of moneys out of the
Consolidated Fund of India to meet such expenditure or the grant in respect of such demand as they have
effect in relation to the annual financial statement and the expenditure mentioned therein or to a demand
for a grant and the law to be made for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated
Fund of India to meet such expenditure or grant.
116. Votes on account, votes of credit and exceptional grants.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing provisions of this Chapter, the House of the People shall have power—

year pending the completion of the procedure prescribed in article 113 for the voting of such grant and
the passing of the law in accordance with the provisions of article 114 in relation to that expenditure;
(b) to make a grant for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India when on account
of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service the demand cannot be stated with the details
ordinarily given in an annual financial statement;
(c) to make an exceptional grant which forms no part of the current service of any financial year;
and Parliament shall have power to authorise by law the withdrawal of moneys from the Consolidated
Fund of India for the purposes for which the said grants are made.
(2) The provisions of articles 113 and 114 shall have effect in relation to the making of any grant under
clause (1) and to any law to be made under that clause as they have effect in relation to the making of a

for the authorisation of appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India to meet such
expenditure.

the Council of States:
Provided that no recommendation shall be required under this clause for the moving of an amendment
making provision for the reduction or abolition of any tax.
(2) A Bill or amendment shall not be deemed to make provision for any of the matters aforesaid by
reason only that it provides for the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or
payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition,
abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.
