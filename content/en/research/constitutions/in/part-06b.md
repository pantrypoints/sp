rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of
any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.

introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message and, when a Bill is so returned,
the House or Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again by the House or
Houses with or without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent, the Governor shall not
withhold assent therefrom:
Provided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve for the consideration of the

of the President, the President shall declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent
therefrom:

Bill to the House or, as the case may be, the Houses of the Legislature of the State together with such a

amount shown in the statement previously laid before the House or Houses.

additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual financial statement for
that year, or
