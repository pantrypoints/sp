The celestial spheres are arranged in the following order:  

At the highest level is the sphere of the fixed stars, which is immovable and encompasses and positions all things. Beneath it is Saturn, followed by Jupiter, then Mars. Below Mars is the sphere in which we are carried (Earth). Next comes Venus, and the innermost is Mercury.  

The sphere of the Moon, however, revolves around the center of the Earth and is carried along with it like an epicycle. Each of these spheres surpasses the one below it in speed of revolution, according to the larger or smaller distances they traverse. Thus, Saturn completes its revolution in thirty years, Jupiter in twelve years, Mars in three years, the Earth in one year. Venus completes its revolution in nine months, and Mercury in three months.
