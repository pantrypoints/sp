Besides its annual motion, as previously mentioned, the Moon appears to move through four distinct motions. First, it completes **monthly revolutions** around the Earth’s center in its **deferent orbit**, following the order of the zodiac signs. This deferent also carries what is called the **epicycle of the first inequality** (or "of the argument"), which we refer to as the **greater epicycle**. Additionally, there is a **second epicycle** attached to it, which moves **opposite to the reflex motion of the deferent orbit** at a slightly slower pace than the **monthly motion**.  

The Moon, suspended within this system, completes **two revolutions per month** in the opposite direction of the greater epicycle. Whenever the center of the greater epicycle aligns with a straight line drawn from the center of the large orbital sphere through the Earth’s center (which we call the **diameter of the great orbit**), the Moon is at its closest point to the **center of the greater epicycle**. This occurs **around the time of the new and full moon**. Conversely, during the **first and last quarters**, it is at its **furthest** from this center.  

The radius of the **greater epicycle** is **one-tenth** of the radius of the **deferent orbit**, plus a fraction **of one unit**. The radius of the **smaller epicycle**, in contrast, is **five times less** one-fourth of this same value. Because of this, the Moon appears to **speed up, slow down, rise, and fall**, producing **variations in its motion** due to the **smaller epicycle**. This epicycle draws the Moon **away from uniformity**, creating a **maximum variation of 17 degrees and one-quarter of a degree** in its orbit. Additionally, the **center of the greater epicycle** alternately **pulls the Moon away or draws it closer**, depending on the radius of this epicycle.  

As a result, since the Moon traces unequal paths around the **center of the greater epicycle**, the **first inequality** undergoes **multiple variations**. This is why, **during conjunctions and oppositions to the Sun**, the maximum variation does not exceed **4 degrees and 56 minutes**, whereas in **quadratures**, it extends to **6 degrees and 36 minutes**. Those who have attempted to explain this motion using an **eccentric orbit** have made **two clear errors**, besides introducing an **illogical inequality** in the circular motion itself. Mathematically, this would imply that in quadratures, when the Moon is at the **lowest part of its epicycle**, it would appear **four times larger** than when it is new or full—unless one recklessly claims that the **Moon's physical size changes**, which is absurd.  

Additionally, the **apparent size of the Moon** is affected by the **notable size of the Earth** relative to its distance. This effect becomes particularly **pronounced near quadratures**. However, careful observation reveals that the apparent size of the Moon **in quadratures differs very little** from what is observed at the **new and full moon**, confirming the validity of this model.  

Along with these **three longitudinal motions**, the Moon also follows a **latitudinal motion** through **nodal points**. The axes of the **epicycles remain parallel to the axis of the deferent**, meaning the Moon does not deviate from its general orbital plane.  

However, the **Moon's orbit is tilted** with respect to the axis of the **great orbit** (the **ecliptic**), causing the Moon to **deviate from the ecliptic plane**. This inclination corresponds to an **angle subtended by five degrees on the orbital circumference**, and its **poles** move along a path parallel to the axis of the ecliptic—similar to what was previously described for the **Earth's axial tilt**. However, this motion occurs in the **opposite direction of the zodiacal signs** and at a **much slower rate**, taking **19 years** to complete a full revolution. Many scholars believe this motion occurs in a more **elevated orbital sphere**, whose poles undergo movement in this manner.  

Thus, this appears to be the structure of the Moon’s motions.
