Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars follow a **similar pattern of motion**. Their orbits are completely enclosed within the **great annual orbit**, revolving in a **common center** in accordance with the **order of the zodiac signs**. However, Saturn completes its orbit in **thirty years**, Jupiter in **twelve years**, and Mars in **twenty-nine months**, as though the **size of their orbits affects the speed of their revolutions**.  

If we take the **semi-diameter of the great orbit** as **25 parts**, then:  
- The **semi-diameter of Mars’ orbit** measures **30 parts**  
- The **semi-diameter of Jupiter’s orbit** measures **130 parts plus a small fraction**  
- The **semi-diameter of Saturn’s orbit** measures **230 parts and one-sixth**  

(Here, the term "semi-diameter" refers to the **distance from the center of the great orbit to the center of the first epicycle**.)

Each of these planets has **two epicycles**, much like the Moon, but following a **different law**.  
- The **first epicycle**, moving in the opposite direction to the orbit, completes as many revolutions as the orbit itself.  
- The **second epicycle**, opposing the first, **doubles** the speed of revolution around the planet.  

As a result, when the planet is **at its farthest distance** from the center of its orbit (or at its **closest proximity**), it remains **nearest to the center of its epicycle**. However, at the **quadrants of its orbit**, the planet is at its **greatest distance** from this center.  

### **Fixed Positions of the Apsides**  
Due to this complex combination of **orbits, epicycles, and revolutions**, the **greatest elongations and approaches** of the planets remain **fixed beneath the firmament**. This means that their **apsides (farthest and closest points in orbit) remain unchanged**:  
- Saturn’s **apsis** is located near the **star above the shoulder of Sagittarius**.  
- Jupiter’s **apsis** is **8 degrees beyond the star marking the end of Leo’s tail**.  
- Mars’ **apsis** is **6.5 degrees ahead of the Lion’s heart (Regulus)**.  

### **Sizes of the Epicycles**  
The **semi-diameters of the epicycles** are as follows (relative to a great orbit semi-diameter of 25 parts):  
- **Saturn**:  
  - First epicycle: **19 parts, 41 minutes**  
  - Second epicycle: **6 parts, 34 minutes**  
- **Jupiter**:  
  - First epicycle: **10 parts, 6 minutes**  
  - Second epicycle: **3 parts, 22 minutes**  
- **Mars**:  
  - First epicycle: **5 parts, 34 minutes**  
  - Second epicycle: **1 part, 51 minutes**  

The **first epicycle** is always **three times larger** than the second.  

### **Primary and Secondary Irregularities in Motion**  
The **primary irregularity** is caused by the **motion of the epicycles**, which create the **major variations** in the planet's movement, always within **fixed limits** beneath the firmament.  

However, there is also a **secondary irregularity**:  
- The planets sometimes appear to **move backward (retrograde)** or **pause (stationary motion)**.  
- This effect is not due to the planets themselves, but rather to the **Earth’s movement** around the great orbit, which alters our **line of sight**.  
- When the **Earth moves faster** than the planet, it **appears to move backward** in the sky. This happens when the **Earth is closest to the planet**, particularly when the planet **rises as an evening star**.  
- Conversely, when the planet **sets in the evening or rises in the morning**, it appears to **move forward** again.  
- When the **Earth’s motion perfectly counteracts the planet’s motion**, the planet seems to **pause**—this typically occurs **when the Sun, Earth, and planet form a right triangle**.  

The extent of this irregularity depends on **how close the planet is to the Earth**:  
- It is **smallest for Saturn**, **larger for Jupiter**, and **greatest for Mars**, based on the proportion of their **orbit sizes** to that of the great orbit.  
- The **greatest irregularity occurs** when the planet is positioned so that its **line of sight touches the circumference of the great orbit**.  

### **Latitude Deviations of the Planets**  
The three superior planets **deviate in latitude** in a **double manner**:  
- Their **epicycles remain in a single plane**, yet their orbits **tilt away from the ecliptic** due to the **deflection of their axes**.  
- Unlike the Moon, their epicycles **do not rotate**, but always remain **aligned with the same region of the sky**.  
- The **nodes** (where their orbits intersect the ecliptic) **remain fixed in space**:  
  - **Saturn’s ascending node** is **8.5 degrees beyond the eastern star in Gemini’s head**.  
  - **Jupiter’s ascending node** is **4 degrees before that same star**.  
  - **Mars’ ascending node** is **6.5 degrees ahead of the Pleiades (in Taurus)**.  

At these nodes, the **planets exhibit no latitude**, but their **maximum latitudes occur at their quadratures**, varying **greatly** depending on their **orbital inclinations**.  

The maximum inclinations occur when the **Earth is closest to the planet** (during its evening rise):  
- **Saturn**: **2.67° inclination**  
- **Jupiter**: **1.67° inclination**  
- **Mars**: **1.17° inclination**  

Conversely, when the **Earth is at its farthest point** (during evening setting or morning rising), the inclination is **reduced**:  
- **Saturn and Jupiter**: **reduced by 0.83°**  
- **Mars**: **reduced by 1.67°**  

Thus, these latitude variations are most **noticeable at their maximum values** and gradually **decrease** as the planet approaches its **node**.  

### **Effect of Earth’s Motion on Latitude**  
The **Earth’s movement** in the great orbit also **alters our perception** of planetary latitudes:  
- Depending on **proximity or distance**, the **angle of visual latitude changes**.  
- This effect follows **mathematical principles**, as it is a **libration motion** occurring along a **straight line**.  

It is possible that the **combination of two orbital motions** is responsible for this effect:  
- If these orbits are **concentric**, then the **lower orbit carries the poles of the upper one**, rotating them at **double the speed**.  
- Each orbit’s **pole is deflected** relative to the **pole of the next higher orbit**.  

Thus, we have described **Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars**, as well as the **orbits surrounding the Earth**.
