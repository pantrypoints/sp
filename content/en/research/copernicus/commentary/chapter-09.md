But of all celestial motions, the most **marvelous** is that of **Mercury**, which follows paths so nearly **untraceable** that they are not easily investigated. 

Adding to the difficulty is the fact that Mercury is **mostly invisible**, as it moves within the **rays of the Sun**, appearing only for a **very few days** before disappearing again. Nevertheless, it too can be understood—**provided that one applies a sufficiently keen intellect**.  

Like Venus, Mercury also has **two epicycles** that revolve within its orbit. The **larger epicycle** moves in step with the orbit, much like in Venus, positioning its **apse** **14.5 degrees beyond** the bright star **Spica in Virgo**. The **smaller epicycle**, however, rotates in the opposite manner, completing **two revolutions for every one of the larger epicycle**, so that in any position of the Earth, when it aligns with or directly opposes Mercury’s **apse**, the planet is at its **farthest distance** from the center of the larger epicycle, while in the **quadrants**, it is at its **nearest point**.  

We have stated that Mercury’s orbit returns in **three months**, or **88 days**. Its **semidiameter** measures **9 and 2/5 parts**, where the **semidiameter of the great orbit** is taken as **25 parts**. From this, the **first epicycle** measures **1 part and 41 minutes**, while the **second epicycle** measures about **34 minutes**, or **one-third** of the first.  

However, in the case of Mercury, this **system of circles is insufficient**, unlike in other planets. When the Earth moves through its **apse alignments**, Mercury appears to move within a **much smaller** orbit than what the previous explanation of circles would imply; yet, at the **quadratures**, it appears to move in a **much larger** orbit.

Since no other **irregularities in its longitude** are observed, it follows that these variations must be due to an **oscillating approach and retreat** of the orbit’s center along a straight line. This requires **two additional small orbits**, both having axes parallel to the **axis of the main orbit**. The center of the **larger epicycle** remains at a **constant distance** from the center of the **immediately enclosing orbit**, just as this orbit’s center is equally distanced from the **outermost orbit’s center**.  

This **displacement** has been determined to measure **14 minutes and 30 seconds of a single 25-part division** of the entire system. The motion of the **outermost small orbit** completes **two full revolutions per year**, while the **inner orbit**, moving in a reflexive manner, completes **four such returns**.

This **composite motion** causes the **center of the larger epicycle** to shift back and forth **in a straight line**, much like the **oscillations in latitude** we discussed before. 

Thus, when the **Earth is at the apse of Mercury’s orbit**, the **center of the larger epicycle** is **closest to the center of the main orbit**; but at **quadrature**, it is at its **farthest distance**. At **midway points** (45-degree separations), the **center of the larger epicycle** aligns with the **center of the outer orbit**, and the two coincide. The magnitude of this **approach and retreat** amounts to **29 minutes** of the same **25-part measurement system**.  

Thus far, this describes the **longitudinal motion of Mercury**.  


### Mercury’s Latitude  

Mercury’s **latitudinal** motion follows a **pattern similar to Venus**, but always in the **opposite direction**. **When Venus moves northward, Mercury moves southward.** Mercury’s orbit is inclined to the **ecliptic** by **seven degrees**. However, its **maximum deviation**—which remains **entirely southward**—never exceeds **three-quarters of a degree**. Otherwise, everything previously stated about Venus' latitude also applies to Mercury and need not be repeated.  


### The Number of Planetary Circles  

Thus, Mercury moves in a system of **seven circles**, Venus in **five**, the **Earth in three**, and the **Moon in four** around it. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn each have **five circles**.  

In total, **34 circles** suffice to explain **the entire structure of the cosmos** and the **entire dance of the stars**.
