3. The new era is when all ethnic groups in the country unite and struggle for a better life and gradually realize the common prosperity

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the essential requirements of
socialism, based on the direction of struggle, makes plans for the future life of the people, clarifies
the value orientation of the new era, and highlights the people's nature in the new era.
Socialism is the cause of happiness for the vast majority of people. 

To build socialism, the
fundamental thing is to liberate the productive forces, develop the productive forces, eliminate
exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity. Since the 18th
National Congress of the CCP, Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that we must always take the realization, safeguarding and development of the fundamental interests
of the broadest masses of the people as the starting point and foothold of all work, and have stressed
on many occasions: 

{{< l a="Xi Jinping" >}}
The people's yearning for a better life is our goal.
{{< /l >}}


The CPC leads the people in revolution, construction, and reform in order to enable the people to live a good life. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, our party regards the continuous creation of a better life and the gradual realization of common prosperity of all the people as the goal and destination of development, embodies the people-centered development thinking, embodies the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, and embodies the essential requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics.


After rapid development since the reform and opening up, the living standards of our people have
improved markedly and their prosperity has continued to increase. In the new era, on the one hand,
the needs of the people are characterized by diversification, multi-level and multi-faceted
characteristics, and the people's yearning for a better life is stronger, looking forward to better
education, more stable work, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, higher level
of medical and health services, more comfortable living conditions, a more beautiful environment,
a richer spiritual and cultural life, and so on. On the other hand, with the continuous expansion of
the "cake" of China's economic development, the problem of unfair distribution has gradually
become prominent, the gap between income and the level of public services in urban and rural areas
is large, and achieving common prosperity and promoting social fairness and justice have become
urgent requirements.

Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: 

{{< l a="Xi Jinping" >}}
Sharing the fruits of reform and development by the broad masses of the people is the essential requirement of socialism and an important embodiment of our party's
fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.
{{< /l >}}



The development we pursue is
development that benefits the people, and the prosperity we pursue is the common prosperity of all
the people. In the new era, the major task of the CCP is to focus on solving the needs and expectations of the people, pay more attention to the people's new and diversified
needs for a better life, respect the people's status as the main body, respect the people's will, the
experience they have created, and the rights they have in their practical activities. The role played
by it fully stimulates the creative power hidden in the people, regards the realization of all-round
human development as the noble realm of a better life, and better meets the people's growing needs
for a better life; pays more attention to enabling all people to share the fruits of economic, political,
cultural, social, ecological and other aspects of development, so that the people's sense of gain,
happiness and security is more perfect, more sustainable, and more sustainable. 

More secure; pay
more attention to social fairness and justice, unite and lead all the people, and continuously
guarantee and improve the people's livelihood with their own hard work and unremitting efforts, so
that the results of reform and development can benefit all the people more equitably, so that all the
people can enjoy a happier and healthier life, and continue to make real new progress in realizing
common prosperity for all the people.

4. the new era is an era in which all the sons and daughters of China work together to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation

The connotation of this dimension of the new era, focusing on the historical mission of the
communists, based on unity and struggle, expounds the development vision of the Chinese nation,
clarifies the national characteristics of the new era, and highlights the national nature of the new era.
Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in
modern times, and it embodies the long-cherished wish of several generations of Chinese. Once
founded, the CCP has no hesitation in shouldering the historical mission of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The founding of New China laid a solid
foundation for national rejuvenation. The new great revolution of reform and opening up has
injected new strong vitality into national rejuvenation, enabled the Chinese nation to gradually
realize the great leap from standing up to becoming rich, and laid the basic conditions for becoming
strong. Under the leadership of the CCP, China, the world's largest developing
country, has created an earth-shaking development miracle in the history of human social
development, and the Chinese nation has radiated new vigor.

Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, under the strong leadership of
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Chinese nation has ushered
in a great process of becoming stronger, its comprehensive national strength has been greatly
enhanced, the people's living standards have been further improved, and the realization of the
Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has become the "greatest common
divisor" that inspires the sons and daughters of China at home and abroad. In the new era of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we are closer than ever before, more confident and capable
of realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
He who travels a hundred miles is half ninety. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is by no
means easy and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums. To realize the great dream of the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the party must unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all
the enthusiasm that can be aroused, arouse all the spirit and spirit that can be aroused, concentrate
on construction, devote oneself to development, and be prepared to make even more arduous and
arduous efforts with high fighting spirit and fearless spirit. If the Chinese Communists in the new
era lead the Chinese people to continue to take the new Long March, they will certainly be able to
achieve the grand goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

5. the new era is an era in which China is moving closer to the center of the world stage and constantly making greater contributions to mankind

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the responsibility of major countries,
based on its own development, makes a forward-looking description of China's role in the world,
clarifies China's positioning in the world in the new era, and highlights the cosmopolitan nature of
the new era.

China is the China of the world, China's development is inseparable from the world, and the
development of the world also affects China. In the profound adjustment of the international system
and international order, China plays an important role. For a long time in the past, China was not
the protagonist of the international community, and China's international influence and role were
relatively limited. 

After long-term efforts, especially the historic achievements made since the 18th
National Congress of the CCP, China's role as a responsible major country
has been fully played and has become the main stabilizer and power source of world economic
growth; China actively participates in and leads global governance, and China's initiatives are
increasingly translated into international consensus and global actions, especially focusing on jointly
building the "Belt and Road", and working with all parties to build a new platform for international
cooperation, adding new impetus to the common development of the world. This series of major
achievements and measures shows that China is an important player that has attracted global
attention, greatly improved its international influence, appeal and shaping power, and has become a
leader in globalization, an important promoter of global governance system reform, and an active
advocate of a community with a shared future for mankind, and is increasingly approaching the
center of the world stage.


{{< l a="Xi Jinping" >}}
The CCP is a political party that seeks happiness for the Chinese and the people, and it is also a political party that strives for the cause of
human progress. The CCP has always regarded making new and greater contributions to mankind as its mission.
{{< /l >}}


In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
in the face of the deep adjustment of the international pattern and international relations, and in the
face of the external environment in which local conflicts and turbulence are frequent and mankind
needs to cope with many common challenges, we must, on the basis of practicing "internal strength",
give full play to the wisdom and talents of the Chinese people, and contribute Chinese wisdom and
provide Chinese solutions for the healthy and sustainable development of the international
community.

<!-- In the new era, China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, pursue an open
strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, and firmly safeguard multilateralism and the
international system with the United Nations at its core. Actively participate in the reform and
improvement of the global governance system, unswervingly safeguard an open world economy,
and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. Strengthen
communication, dialogue, coordination and cooperation with major powers, deepen relations with
neighboring countries, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation with developing countries.
Actively provide more constructive solutions for properly responding to global challenges and
resolving regional hotspot issues. We will work hand in hand with other countries and work together
to always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of
international order. Historically, China has made outstanding contributions to human civilization. In
the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, China will certainly be able to make new and
greater contributions to promoting lasting peace and common development in the world and
promoting the prosperity and progress of mankind.
