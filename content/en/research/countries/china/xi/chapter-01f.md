<!-- Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a struggle, and adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era also requires struggle. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed, "We must
persist in taking the people's yearning for a better life as our goal, always make unremitting efforts
for the people, work together with the people, and earnestly implement the spirit of struggle in the
whole process of carrying out great struggles, building great projects, advancing great causes, and
realizing great dreams, forming a vivid situation of competing and fighting in unity."3 -->


1. Always maintain the fundamental motivation to never forget the original intention and keep the mission in mind

To carry out great struggles, build great projects, advance great causes, and realize great dreams
require long-term struggle, relay struggle, and common struggle. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "The
original aspiration and mission of the Chinese communists is to seek happiness for the Chinese
people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. This original intention and mission is the
fundamental motive force that motivates the Chinese Communists to keep advancing." 1

The original aspiration and mission of the Chinese Communists are determined by the nature of the
Party and the Party's guiding ideology. The original intention is the purpose of the original departure,
that is, why the departure, the goal to be achieved or the task to be completed. Marx and Engels
pointed out in the Communist Manifesto: "The movement of the proletariat is an independent
movement of the overwhelming majority of the people, for the interests of the overwhelming
majority of the people."2 Communists "have no interests different from those of the proletariat as a
whole."3 

That is to say, the original intention and mission of Marxism and the communists under its
guidance is to seek the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people. After its founding, the
Communist Party of China took Marxism as its guiding ideology, regarded the realization of
communism as the party's highest ideal and ultimate goal, shouldered the historical mission of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation without hesitation, united and led the people
in an arduous struggle, and composed a magnificent epic that swallowed mountains and rivers.
As a political organization, the original mission of the Communist Party of China was to follow the
path guided by Marxism and seek the independence and prosperity of the country and the freedom
and happiness of the people. We reaffirm the original intention of the Party and the historical mission
of the Chinese Communists in the new era, that is, to enable more than 90 million Party members
to continuously gain strong primary impetus from it. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Our party
requires all comrades in the party not to forget their original intention and remember their mission,
that is, to remind all comrades in the party that the party's original intention and mission are the
concentrated embodiment of the party's nature, purpose, ideals and beliefs, and fighting goals, and
the longer they stay in power, the more they must not lose the true colors of a Marxist political party,
the more they must not forget the party's original intention and mission, and the more they must not
lose their self-revolutionary spirit."

No matter how far we go and how great our achievements are, we must not forget the road we
came from, the history written by the Party with blood, sweat, and tears, why we set out, the goal of
achieving the prosperity and strength of the country, the rejuvenation of the people, and the lofty
ideal of communism. Whether in the revolutionary years of the blazing flames, or in the years of
vigorous construction and the period of magnificent reform, the unchanged original intention is the
spiritual code of uniting and condensing the communists to continue their struggle, and is the key
to the success of the party from victory to new victory.

In July 2013, Comrade Xi Jinping went to Xibaipo, Hebei Province to conduct research, revisit the
"two musts" and issue a call to the whole party to "catch up for the exam"; only one week after the
conclusion of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping
led the new Politburo Standing Committee members to Shanghai and Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province to
visit the site of the First Congress and the Red Boat on Nanhu, review the history of the founding
of the Party, relive the oath of the People's Party, and declare the firm political conviction of the new
leadership of the Party Central Committee. According to the arrangements of the 19th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, starting from June 2019, the theme education of "not
forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission" will be carried out in two batches
from top to bottom in the whole party, promoting the whole party to firmly grasp the general
requirements of "keeping the original intention, undertaking the mission, finding the gaps, and
grasping implementation", and strive to achieve the specific goals of gaining gains in theoretical
study, being baptized ideologically and politically, daring to take responsibility for entrepreneurship,
serving the people and solving problems, and setting an example of honesty and integrity. The
Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee proposed that we should establish a
system that does not forget our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind, and regard
not forgetting our original aspiration and keeping our mission in mind as an eternal task for
strengthening party building and a lifelong task for all party members and cadres. All this is to tell
the world that the Communist Party of China will always maintain the spirit of struggle in the
revolution and always maintain its heart for the people. This fully demonstrates the firm
determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to never forget
its original intention and strive forever.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Ideals and beliefs are the spiritual calcium of communists, and if
the ideals and beliefs are firm, the bones will be hard; without ideals and beliefs, or if the ideals and
beliefs are not firm, the spirit will be 'calcium deficient', and you will get: cartilage." 2 He also
emphasized:

"History and practice have repeatedly proved that if a political party has lofty ideals and lofty
pursuits, it will be strong, invincible, and invincible, and will be able to withstand setbacks again
and again and rise up again and again; if a cadre has firm ideals and convictions, he will be able to
stand tall and broad-minded, and he will be able to adhere to the correct political orientation and be
as calm as a mountain without moving through storms." 1 The ideals and beliefs of the Chinese
Communists have never been ethereal, but have always been embodied in their original aspiration
and mission of seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.
We must adhere to the Marxist faith and the lofty ideals of communism, engrave in our hearts the
original intention of the Party and the mission of the Party, build a solid foundation of faith, replenish
the calcium of the spirit, stabilize the rudder of thinking, always breathe with the people, share a
common destiny, and link hearts with each other, always regard the people's yearning for a better
life as the goal of struggle, and continue to forge ahead courageously towards the grand goal of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with an unremitting mental state and an
indomitable attitude of struggle.

2. Always maintain the spirit of having the courage to assume responsibilities and dare to struggle

The eyes are difficult and difficult, and the jade is successful. The more difficulties and
contradictions stand in the way, the more it is necessary to rely on responsibility and struggle to
overcome difficulties and keep innovation upright. Strong historical responsibility and fighting spirit
are the spiritual characteristics of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for
a New Era. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping
has taken the lead in setting an example, clearly pointing out the ruling philosophy of "serving the
people and shouldering the responsibilities that should be shouldered", clearly putting forward that
"I will live up to the people without myself", and repeatedly emphasizing that "the ministry must
have a responsibility, how much responsibility can do how much cause, how much responsibility
can make great achievements", and "push forward socialism with Chinese characteristics with a new
mental state and fighting attitude.”

Our party is a party that is born, grows and grows in the course of struggle. After nearly a century
of struggle, the spirit of struggle has long been in the bloodline of the Party and runs through all
periods of revolution, construction and reform. Today, the Chinese nation is in a crucial period of
great rejuvenation, reform and development are in an important stage of overcoming difficulties and
conquering difficulties, and the road ahead cannot be smooth. This is the time when the struggle is
most needed, and it is also the time when the responsibility is most tested. In the face of the new
mission, we must fully understand the protracted, complex, and arduous nature of the struggle, and
we must carry forward the spirit of having the courage to assume responsibilities and dare to struggle.

Only by taking the posture of opening up roads every mountain and building bridges when
encountering water, and with abundant and tenacious fighting spirit, can we cross the "snowy
mountains" and "meadows" on the new Long March, conquer the "Loushan Pass" and "Laozikou"
on the new journey, and constantly win new victories in the great struggle of the new era.
Big things are difficult to bear, and major risks especially need to be fought for. At present, the
international situation is turbulent, the surrounding environment is complex and sensitive, the tasks
of reform, development and stability are heavy, various problems are superimposed, various
contradictions are prominent, various ideologies and interests are stirring each other, and various
risks and challenges are coming one after another. In particular, it is necessary to dare to take
responsibility and fight well in preventing and resolving major risks. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out: "We must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, both the black swan 'incident' and the
gray rhino 'incident; we must have the first hand to prevent risks, and we must also have the high
tactics to deal with and resolve risk challenges; we must fight a prepared battle to prevent and resist
risks, and we must also fight a strategic initiative battle to turn dangers into opportunities and turn
crises into opportunities."1 We must fully understand the importance and urgency of preventing and
defusing major risks, maintain the spirit of struggle, strengthen the experience of struggle, constantly
undergo strict ideological tempering, political experience, and practical tempering, do not bow our
heads in the face of difficulties, do not shrink in the face of challenges, do not trade principles, and
constantly improve our fighting skills in the midst of strong winds and waves and in the tempering
of practice. At the same time, we should dare to show our sword in the face of major right and wrong,
dare to face difficulties in the face of contradictions, dare to stand up in the face of crises, dare to
stand up in the face of crises, and dare to resolutely struggle in the face of unhealthy tendencies and
evil tendencies, so as to "step on the bumpy road and fight against hardships and dangers again." 's
tenacious will, coping well with every major risk and challenge, and pushing forward the cause of
the party and the people without hesitation.

3. Always maintain the practical character of integrating knowledge with action and doing solid work

Struggle cannot be shouted in vain, it must be translated into action. The unity of knowledge and
action and real work are the distinctive qualities of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that "empty talk misleads
the country, practical work rejuvenates the country"; he stressed that the Communist Party of China
started and developed by seeking truth from facts, and that adhering to seeking truth from facts can
rejuvenate the party and the country, and violating the truth from facts will lead to misleading the
party and the country;

He stressed that it is necessary to persist in the persistence of the political elite, establish that success
does not have to be carried out in my thinking, and work through to the end with a blueprint, and do
not engage in things that are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and labored and the
people and hurt money. At the opening ceremony of the 2019 spring semester training course for
young cadres at the Central Party School (National Academy of Administration), Comrade Xi
Jinping encouraged the vast number of cadres, especially young cadres, to adhere to the unity of
knowledge and action, really grasp practical work, be actors who start and do, talk about things
without sitting and talking, be strugglers who overcome difficulties, and bodhisattvas who should
not be afraid of wind and rain. These important expositions are earnest, demonstrating Comrade Xi
Jinping's political character of integrating knowledge with action and doing real work.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the reason why the party and
the country have been able to establish a new wind and open up a new situation is closely related to
Comrade Xi Jinping's efforts to integrate knowledge with action and really do solid work. As the
leader of the party and the state, Comrade Xi Jinping not only pays attention to systematic thinking
and scientific planning on internal and foreign affairs, national defense, party and military
management, world development and global governance, but also pays attention to promoting
practical innovation with theoretical innovation, testing and promoting theoretical innovation with
practical innovation, and comprehensively promoting the "four greats", so as to promote historic
achievements and changes in the development of the cause of the party and the country.

Xi stressed: "Great dreams are not something that can be waited for and shouted
about, but spelled out and done." "We must show the tenacity to grasp the traces of iron and step on
stones, grasp the implementation with the spirit of nails, and ensure that all major reform measures
are implemented."1 

Today, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era has become the guiding ideology of the Party and the country, and the goal and task of winning
the victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then building a
modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way have been clear, and the most important
thing is "action, action, and action" and "implementation, implementation, and implementation.” It
is necessary to establish a correct outlook on undertakings and political achievements, do practical
things without seeking false prestige, seek practical results and do not do false merits, do more work
to lay a foundation and benefit the long term, let it become a common practice to bury one's head in
hard work and really grasp solid work, and strive to create achievements that can stand the test of
practice, the people, and history.
