Section 3: Resolutely achieve "two maintenances"

To uphold and strengthen the party's overall leadership and give full play to the role of the highest
political leadership force of the CCP, the most fundamental thing is to
resolutely safeguard the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central
Committee and the core position of the whole party, and the most important thing is to resolutely
safeguard the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Achieving the "two safeguards" is a major issue of principle that has a bearing on the future and
destiny of the party and the country, the primary task of the party's political construction, and the
fundamental political discipline and political rules that the whole party must abide by.

1. safeguarding the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party is where the fundamental interests of the Party and the country lie The Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee clarified the core position of General
Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party. This is the
inevitable result of the party's adherence to the principle of democratic centralism and the solemn
choice of the whole party and the people of the whole country.

As the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, General Secretary Xi
Jinping was formed in the practice of the new great struggle, reflects the common aspirations of the
whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, is where
the fundamental interests of the Party and the country lie, is the fundamental guarantee for upholding
and strengthening the Party's leadership, and is an urgent need to carry out the great struggle with
many new historical characteristics and to uphold and develop the great cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

The historical mission of the proletarian party objectively requires a strong core of leadership. Marx
once vividly compared that "a single violinist conducts himself, and an orchestra needs an orchestra
director."1 Engels also used the example of sea navigation to illustrate the extreme importance of
the core of authority: "At a critical moment, whether everyone's life can be saved depends on
whether all people can immediately and absolutely obey the will of a person."2 Lenin also pointed
out: "It is a long-term and difficult task to bring up a group of experienced and extremely prestigious
party leaders. But without this, the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 'unity of will' of the
proletariat can only be empty words. "3 Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: "It is necessary to establish
a core of leadership and oppose 'one country, three publics.'"4 Comrade Deng Xiaoping had a deep
understanding and thorough explanation of the core issue of leadership, pointing out: "The key to
the China issue lies in the fact that the Communist Party must have a good Politburo, especially a
good Politburo Standing Committee. As long as there are no problems in this link, China will be as
stable as Mount Tai. "If it stays like this for fifty, sixty years, socialist China will be invincible."5
The historical experience of socialism in the world shows that in order for a Marxist political party
to safeguard the unity of the Party and effectively carry out struggle, it must form a strong core of
leadership and a strong leading collective at the level of the Party Central Committee. The historical
experience of the CCP shows that there must be a strong central leading
collective formed in practice, and there must be a strong leadership core in this leading collective.
Otherwise, the party's cause will not be able to advance from victory to victory.
Comrade Xi Jinping possesses the extraordinary political wisdom, superb leadership ability and
strong personality charm of a Marxist politician, and as the core of the Party Central Committee and
the core of the whole Party, he was formed in the long-term revolutionary practice, in the new great
struggle, in the close contact with the people and in the common struggle.

Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, Comrade Xi Jinping, with a
strong sense of responsibility, has led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout
the country to solve many difficult problems that have been wanted to be solved for a long time but
have not been solved, accomplished many major things that were wanted to be done in the past but
have not been accomplished, promoted historic changes in the cause of the party and the country,
promoted historic changes in the management of the party and the party, and promoted socialism
with Chinese characteristics into a new era. The fundamental reason why the cause of the Party and
the country can create a new situation in an all-round way lies in the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in raising the banner and strategizing, and in the scientific guidance
of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Sixth Plenary
Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee made it clear that Comrade Xi Jinping is the core of the
Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, and the 19th CPC National Congress will
firmly safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
and the centralized and unified leadership to write the Party Constitution, which is the choice of
practice, history, the choice of the whole Party and the choice of the people.

Safeguarding General Secretary Xi Jinping's position as the core of the Party Central Committee
and the core of the whole Party is an urgent need for the development of the cause of the Party and
the country. The CCP has more than 90 million members and more than 4.6
million grassroots party organizations, and the party unites and leads the people to carry out socialist
modernization. Having a leader recognized by the whole party and loved by the people is an
important sign of the maturity of the party. The ship weighs a thousand pounds and has one person
at the helm. To govern a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, to carry out great struggles
with many new historical characteristics, to cope with major changes unprecedented in a century, to
resist major risks and challenges, and to overcome major contradictions and resistances, it must have
a strong core of leadership. Without Comrade Xi Jinping, the core of the Party Central Committee
and the core of the whole Party, there would be no authority and centralized leadership of the Party
Central Committee, there would be no unified thinking and unified action, and there would be no
separate battles and separate administrations, and nothing would be accomplished.

2. Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership is the highest principle of Party leadership Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The history of the Party and the history of the development of
New China tell us that in order to govern our big party and our big country well, it is very important
to ensure the unity and centralization of the party, and it is of great importance to maintain the
authority of the party Central Committee."

Resolutely safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is a major founding principle of the Marxist ruling party, the primary political rule of the
Party, and a magic weapon to ensure that the whole Party is in lockstep.

First, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership are the major founding principles of the Marxist ruling party. A Marxist political party is
not a free and loose club, but a new type of political party shouldering a major historical mission, a
fighting force with strict organization and strict discipline. Marx and Engels once severely criticized
Bakunin's views of "branch autonomy, free association of autonomous groups, anti-authoritarianism,
and anarchy", believing that these slogans were nothing more than an attempt to cover up the
extreme poverty of thought and the fundamental ignorance of the conditions of daily life in society.
When summing up the lessons of the failure of the Paris Commune, Engels clearly pointed out: "The
Paris Commune was destroyed because of the lack of centralization and authority. "2 Engels also
pointed out that authority is needed not only in the period of proletarian revolution, but also in the
period of peacebuilding. Whether it is factory production, railway management, ship navigation, or
even daily travel, it is necessary to obey the authority of rules and regulations. Without serious
authority and strict discipline, such a party can only be a loose club or social organization, and such
a party cannot unite its will and achieve political goals. The CCP is a Marxist
political party organized by revolutionary ideals and iron discipline, and safeguarding the authority
of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership is the fundamental experience
of China's revolution, construction and reform.
Second, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is the primary political rule of the Party. To uphold the party's leadership, we must first
uphold the centralized and unified leadership of the party Central Committee. The right to decide
on the major policies and policies of the party and the state rests with the party Central Committee,
and it is necessary to safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee with practical actions.
Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The party is the core of our leadership in all undertakings, as the
ancients said; six contract winds, Kyushu cooperates', in contemporary China, without the
leadership of the party, this cannot be done." 3 Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central
Committee is a matter of direction and principle, and has a bearing on the future and destiny of the
Party, the nation, and the country.

Any organization and member of the Party, no matter what field, level or unit he or she works in,
must obey the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and safeguard the
authority of the Party Central Committee.

Third, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is the magic weapon to ensure that the whole Party is in lockstep. The theories, lines,
principles, and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee are the basis and basis for the
whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to unify their thinking, will,
and actions. Only when the Party Central Committee has authority can the whole Party be firmly
united, and then the people of all ethnic groups in the country can be closely united, forming a
majestic force that is united and invincible. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We are such a big
party and such a big country, if there is no authority of the Party Central Committee to set a statue,
and the Party Central Committee does not do what it decides, or if each says its own thing and does
its own thing, then nothing can be done." 1 In our party, we must never allow ourselves to act
independently and go our own way, we must not allow orders not to be carried out or prohibitions
to continue, and we will never allow policies at the top and countermeasures at the bottom. The
more complicated the situation facing the Party and the more arduous the tasks it shoulders, the
more it is necessary to safeguard the centralization and unity of the Party.
