Section 3: Steadily advancing in the direction of common prosperity for all the people

Since ancient times, human society has pursued and explored common prosperity, but true common
prosperity can only be achieved when socialism develops to a certain extent. As a Marxist political
party, the CCP regards leading the people to create a better life and achieve
common prosperity as its unswerving goal. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The development
we pursue is development that benefits the people, and the prosperity we pursue is the common
prosperity of all the people." Whether reform and development succeed or not, the ultimate criterion
is whether the people have jointly enjoyed the fruits of reform and development. "1

1. Common prosperity is the fundamental principle of socialism with Chinese characteristics

The concept of common prosperity can be understood from two dimensions: productivity and
production relations. "Common" reflects the way members of society occupy wealth, which is
relative to the polarization caused by private ownership, and is a concentrated embodiment of the
nature of social production relations; "affluent" reflects the degree of ownership of wealth by
members of society, which is relative to poverty and is a concentrated embodiment of the
development level of social productive forces. In this sense, common prosperity is a concept that
reflects specific productive forces and production relations.
The CCP has always regarded sharing the fruits of development and leading
the people to achieve common prosperity as its value goal.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong raised the issue of common prosperity and
continued to explore it. "Now that we implement such a system, such a plan, we can become richer
and stronger year by year, and we can see richer and stronger year by year." And this wealth is
common wealth, this strength, is common strength, everyone has a share."1 Since the reform and
opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has summed up the lessons of the past, once again emphasized
the issue of common prosperity and its way of realization, regarded common prosperity as one of
the basic principles of socialism, and summarized common prosperity as the essential connotation
of socialism. Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed: "Achieving common prosperity is the fundamental
principle and essential characteristic of socialism, and it must not be shaken."2 Comrade Hu Jintao
also demanded: "Let all the people share the fruits of reform and development, and enable all the
people to advance steadily in the direction of common prosperity."3

Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, socialism with Chinese
characteristics has entered a new era. A distinctive feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics
in the new era is that the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country unite and struggle,
constantly create a better life, and gradually realize common prosperity for all the people on the
basis of production and development. At the new historical starting point, Comrade Xi Jinping
attaches great importance to the issue of common prosperity and emphasizes that achieving common
prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism.

An important aspect that distinguishes socialism from capitalism lies in its profound criticism of
capitalist polarization and huge economic and social inequality, emphasizing adherence to the
people-centered approach and dedication to the pursuit of all-round human development and
common prosperity for all people. In his speech at the celebration of the 95th anniversary of the
founding of the CCP, Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "Leading the people
to create a happy life is the unswerving goal of our party. We must conform to the people's yearning
for a better life, adhere to the people-centered development thinking, focus on ensuring and
improving people's livelihood, develop various social undertakings, increase the intensity of income
distribution and regulation, win the battle against poverty, ensure the people's equal participation
and equal development rights, so that the results of reform and development will benefit all the
people more equitably, and steadily move towards the goal of achieving common prosperity for all
the people. "4

The main contradiction in our society has changed from the contradiction between the people's
growing material and cultural needs and backward social production to the contradiction between
the people's growing need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. To adapt to
the changes in the main contradictions in society, it is necessary not only to promote high-quality
economic development, solve the problem of insufficient development, and further expand the
"cake", but also to coordinate the distribution of income, solve the problem of unbalanced
development, and further divide the "cake.” In view of the imbalance in development, especially the
widening gap between income and personnel, Comrade Xi Jinping particularly stressed the need to
achieve shared development. "The 'cake' of China's economic development continues to expand, but
the problem of unfair distribution is more prominent, and the gap between income and the level of
public services in urban and rural areas is large. In sharing the achievements of reform and
development, there are still imperfections in both the actual situation and the system design. To this
end, we must adhere to the principle that development is for the people, development depends on
the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, and make more effective
institutional arrangements so that all the people can steadily advance in the direction of common
prosperity. "1 Practice shows that only by earnestly solving the problem of sharing the fruits of
reform and achieving common prosperity in shared development can we fully embody the
superiority of socialism, effectively enhance the momentum of development, and consolidate and
strengthen the mass foundation for the party's long-term ruling power.

2. Gradually realize common prosperity for all the people

The gradual realization of common prosperity is a systematic project. "Our country is in the primary
stage of socialism and will be for a long time, and we cannot do things beyond the stage, but this
does not mean that we will do nothing in gradually realizing common prosperity, but we must do as
much as possible according to the existing conditions, accumulate small victories into big victories,
and constantly advance towards the goal of common prosperity for all the people." 2 To gradually
achieve common prosperity, we must adhere to the principles of sharing by all, comprehensive
sharing, joint construction and sharing, and gradual sharing, adhere to doing our best and doing what
we can, comprehensively promote the construction of relevant fields, and form a long-term
mechanism for sustainable development. Doing our best emphasizes determination and will, that is,
how much ability to contribute, and actively create conditions for better results;

Doing what we can and insisting on seeking truth from facts means eating, dressing, and measuring
household belongings, without mentioning unrealistic goals, and not doing things that go beyond
stages and abilities.

Persist in taking economic construction as the center, further liberate and develop social productive
forces, and lay a solid material foundation for achieving common prosperity. Production is the
premise and foundation of distribution, and only on the basis of the continuous development of
productive forces can common prosperity be truly realized. China is still in the primary stage of
socialism and will remain for a long time, it is still the largest developing country in the world, and
development is still the top priority of contemporary China and the key to solving all China's
problems.

We must firmly grasp the primary stage of socialism, which is the greatest national
condition, firmly base ourselves on the primary stage of socialism, which is the greatest reality,
unswervingly persist in taking economic construction as the center, fully mobilize the enthusiasm,
initiative, and creativity of the masses, constantly liberate and develop the productive forces, and
improve the quality and efficiency of development. Only in this way can we continuously meet the
people's growing needs for a better life in all aspects, continuously improve their living standards,
and gradually achieve common prosperity. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the realization of
social fairness and justice is determined by many factors, the most important of which is the level
of economic and social development. We must firmly grasp the center of economic construction,
promote sustained and healthy economic development, further expand the 'cake', and lay a more
solid material foundation for ensuring social fairness and justice. "1
Adhere to the two "unwavering" and consolidate the foundation of the economic system for
achieving common prosperity. The basic economic system with public ownership as the main body
and the common development of various ownership economies is an important pillar of the socialist
system with Chinese characteristics. Both the public and non-public economies are components of
the socialist market economy, an important foundation for China's economic and
social development, and an important condition for achieving common prosperity. In today's China, we
must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public ownership economy and adhere to the status
of the main body of public ownership, which plays a fundamental role in enhancing China's
economic strength, safeguarding social fairness and justice, preventing polarization, gradually
realizing common prosperity and promoting social harmony. At the same time, we must
unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public economy, which is
of great significance for promoting economic growth, expanding social employment, increasing
fiscal revenue, improving people's living standards and promoting common prosperity.

Coordinate urban and rural development and regional development, and promote common
prosperity between urban and rural areas and common prosperity in all regions. The dual structure
of urban and rural areas is an important cause of the gap between the rich and the poor. We must
strive to make major breakthroughs in coordinating urban-rural relations, especially in breaking the
dual structure of urban and rural areas, promoting the equal exchange of urban and rural factors and
the balanced allocation of public resources, implementing the strategy of rural revitalization,
injecting new impetus into rural development, and allowing the vast number of farmers to participate
in the process of reform and development on an equal footing and enjoy the fruits of reform and
development together. Regional development gaps are also an important reason for common
prosperity. It is necessary to properly implement the coordinated regional development strategy,
establish a more effective new mechanism for coordinated regional development, and promote the
gradual realization of common prosperity in the process of continuously improving the income level
and quality of life of the people in all regions.
Persist in ensuring and improving people's livelihood in the process of development. It is necessary
to seek more benefits for the people's livelihood and relieve more worries about the people's
livelihood, continuously make new progress in providing education for the young, learning and
teaching, earning income from hard work, treating the sick, providing care for the elderly, housing
and housing, and supporting the weak, so as to make up for the shortcomings of the people's
livelihood in the process of development, so that the people's sense of gain, happiness and security
will be more fulfilling, more secure and more sustainable. To achieve common prosperity, we must
focus on narrowing the income gap, which is a key task in the field of people's livelihood. It is
necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work and improve the system and
mechanism for distribution according to key factors; expand the group of middle-income people,
increase the income of low-income earners, regulate those with excessive income, and ban illegal
income; persist in achieving simultaneous growth of residents' income while economic growth, and
achieve simultaneous increase in labor remuneration while increasing labor productivity; and
broaden the channels for residents' labor income and property income.
