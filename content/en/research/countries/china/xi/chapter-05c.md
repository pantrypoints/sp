Section 2: It has enriched and developed the Marxist outlook on development

The new development concept is the Sinicization and epochalization of the Marxist outlook on
development by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in the new era,
and is the latest theoretical achievement of combining the basic principles of the Marxist outlook on
development with China's specific reality, enriching and developing the Marxist outlook on
development.

1. the scientific connotation and practical requirements of the new development concept

To implement the new development concept, we must grasp its scientific connotation and practical
requirements, clarify the "natural" and "reasonable" in it, and enhance ideological consciousness
and action consciousness.

Innovation is the number one driving force for development. The driving force of development is
the source of development, which determines the speed, efficiency and sustainability of
development. Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, Comrade Xi
Jinping has raised innovation to an unprecedented height and placed it in the primary position of the
new development concept, pointing out: "If we grasp innovation, we will grasp the 'bull's nose' that
affects the overall situation of economic and social development." 1 It has been repeatedly
emphasized that the basis of development is innovation, grasping innovation is to grasp development,
and seeking innovation is to seek the future. Innovation covers theoretical innovation, institutional
innovation, scientific and technological innovation, cultural innovation and other aspects, runs
through all national work, and is overall, systematic and integrated. To adhere to innovative
development, we must put innovation at the core of the overall development of the country, and run
innovative ideas through all fields of economic and social development. It is necessary to
continuously emancipate the mind and guide the practice of constantly developing and changing
economic and social development with theoretical innovation; it is necessary to continuously build
institutional mechanisms to promote development, improve all aspects of institutional systems, and
create a good institutional environment for ensuring development; it is necessary to maximize the
liberation and stimulation of the huge potential of science and technology as the primary productive
force, seize the commanding heights of global science and technology through scientific and
technological innovation, provide an inexhaustible driving force for supporting development, and
accelerate the formation of an economic system and development model mainly led and supported
by innovation;

It is necessary to cultivate the sense of innovation, carry forward the spirit of innovation, establish
the values of advocating innovation, and provide spiritual power for promoting development.
Coordination is an inherent requirement for sustained and healthy development. Development is a
whole and a system, which requires the cooperation and linkage of all aspects, links and factors. The
concept of coordinated development is put forward on the basis of summing up the lessons learned
from economic and social development at home and abroad and grasping the law of development,
and in view of the outstanding problems of imbalance and incoordination in China's development.
While paying attention to the speed of development, coordinated development pays more attention
to the wholeness, coordination and balance of development, pays more attention to the overall and
comprehensive balance, pays more attention to the relationship between the local and the overall
situation, the current and long-term, the key and non-key points, and pays more attention to making
up for shortcomings and narrowing the gap, which is development with more complete content and
higher quality. To adhere to coordinated development, in practice, it is required to firmly grasp the
overall layout of the "five-in-one" and the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, correctly grasp
the major relations in development, and constantly make up for the shortcomings of development
and enhance the stamina for development. The key points are to promote the coordinated
development of urban and rural areas, broaden the spatial layout of development, and optimize the
pattern of interests of development; promote coordinated economic and social development and
solve the problem of "one leg is long and one leg is short"; promote the synchronous development
of new-type industrialization, informationization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and
enhance the overall efficiency of development; promote the coordinated development of material
civilization and spiritual civilization, and promote the joint enhancement of the country's "hard
power" and "soft power"; promote the integrated development of economic construction and
national defense construction, and adhere to the balance between development and security, and the
unity of a rich country and a strong military. The ultimate goal of promoting coordinated
development is to promote the stability and long-term development of China's economy and society,
and promote the formation of a situation of all-round development in all regions and fields.
Green is a necessary condition for sustainable development. "Green development, in its essence, is
to solve the problem of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. "1The natural world is the
basis and premise of the birth, existence and development of human society, and human beings can
purposefully use nature and transform nature through social activities, but human beings are
ultimately part of nature, and must respect nature, conform to nature, protect nature, and cannot be
above nature, otherwise they will be retaliated by nature. This is a law of nature that no one can
change. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China's economy and society have
achieved rapid development.

However, there are many debts in terms of ecological environment, and the environmental problems
accumulated over the years have entered the stage of high intensity and frequent occurrence. At the
same time, the people's requirements for clean air, clean drinking water, safe food and a beautiful
environment are getting higher and higher. Adhering to green development requires putting
ecological environmental protection in a more prominent position, establishing the concept that
protecting the ecological environment is to protect productive forces and improving the ecological
environment is to develop productive forces; adhere to the principle that green water and green
mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains, protect the ecological environment like eyes,
and treat the ecological environment like life. It is necessary to adhere to the basic national policy
of saving resources and protecting the environment, adhere to sustainable development, adhere to
the civilized development path of production development, rich life and good ecology, accelerate
the construction of a resource-saving and environment-friendly society, form a new pattern of
harmonious development and modernization of man and nature, promote green development
methods and lifestyles, promote harmonious and symbiotic development between man and nature,
build a beautiful China, and make new contributions to global ecological security.
Opening up is the only way for a country to prosper and develop. Openness brings progress, while
closure inevitably leads to backwardness. "If a country and a nation want to rejuvenate, it must
advance in the logic of historical progress and develop in the trend of the development of the times.
"1 Looking back at history, open cooperation is an important driving force for enhancing the vitality
of international economy and trade; looking to the future, open cooperation is the requirement of
the times to promote the continuous progress of human society. Under the conditions of
globalization, if we want to develop and grow with the times and continuously improve our
international competitiveness, we must unswervingly open up and expand opening up. To adhere to
open development, it is necessary to conform to the trend of the times, make overall use of both
international and domestic markets and resources, focus on solving the problem of internal and
external linkage of development, take meeting domestic demand as the starting point and foothold
of development, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main
body and the domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other. To expand new space,
it is necessary to pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, develop a higher-level
open economy, and build a broad community of interests; it is necessary to actively participate in
global economic governance and the supply of public goods, and improve China's institutional voice
in global economic governance; it is necessary to resolutely safeguard China's development interests,
actively prevent various risks, and ensure national economic security.

Sharing is the essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Governing the
country is constant, and benefiting the people is the foundation. Allowing the broad masses of the
people to share the fruits of reform and development is the essential requirement of socialism, a
concentrated embodiment of the superiority of the socialist system, and an important embodiment
of the CPC's fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. Shared development
focuses on solving the problem of social fairness and justice, and the essence is to adhere to the
people-centered approach. It mainly includes four meanings: First, from the perspective of coverage,
it requires sharing by all people. Shared development is enjoyed by everyone and each has its own
place, not shared by a few and shared by some people. Second, from the perspective of content,
comprehensive sharing is required. Shared development means sharing the achievements of national
economic, political, cultural, social and ecological construction, and comprehensively protecting the
legitimate rights and interests of the people in all aspects.
From the perspective of the way of implementation, it requires joint construction and sharing. Co-
construction can be shared, and the process of co-construction is also a process of sharing. It is
necessary to give full play to democracy, extensively gather the wisdom of the people, stimulate the
people's strength to the greatest extent, and form a vivid situation in which everyone participates,
everyone does their best, and everyone has a sense of achievement. Fourth, from the perspective of
the promotion process, gradual sharing is required. Shared development is a process from low level
to high level, from unbalanced to balanced, and we must think about and design sharing policies
based on national conditions and economic and social development levels. These four aspects are
interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and should be understood and grasped as a whole. On the
one hand, it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses of
the people to continuously make the "cake" bigger; on the other hand, it is necessary to divide the
"cake" that is constantly expanding so that all the people can have a greater sense of gain in joint
construction and shared development, enhance the momentum of development, enhance the unity
of the people, and steadily advance in the direction of common prosperity.
