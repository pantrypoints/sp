2. the "two-step" strategic arrangement for the new era on the basis of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way

In accordance with the "two-step" strategic arrangement for the new era on the basis of building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, to promote China's socialist modernization drive,
it is necessary to accelerate the development process and raise the level of development, which is
both an inspiring grand blueprint and a historical process of unremitting struggle. This requires the
whole party and the people of the whole country to grasp the international and domestic situation
and China's development conditions, seize the opportunity, seize the momentum, earnestly
accelerate the process of socialist modernization, strive to expand the broad space of socialist
modernization, and effectively promote the comprehensive improvement of China's material,
political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations.

First, focus on economic modernization and continuously improve the level of material civilization.

Building a modern socialist country is inseparable from a strong material foundation. The main
contradiction in our society in the new era is the contradiction between the people's growing need
for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development, and China's economy has shifted from
a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage, and is in a critical period of
transforming the development mode, optimizing the economic structure, and transforming the
growth momentum. It is necessary to implement the new development concept, unswervingly regard
development as the top priority for the party to govern and rejuvenate the country, persist in
liberating and developing the social productive forces, adhere to the direction of socialist market
economic reform, and accelerate the realization of economic modernization. It is necessary to adhere
to quality first, benefit first, take supply-side structural reform as the main line, promote the quality
change, efficiency change and power change of economic development, and improve total factor
productivity. Efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of an industrial system with
coordinated development of the real economy, scientific and technological innovation, modern
finance, and human resources; strive to build an economic system with effective market mechanisms,
vigorous micro-subjects, and moderate macro-control, build a modern economic system,
continuously enhance China's economic innovation and competitiveness, and continuously improve
the level of material civilization.

Second, focus on modernizing the national governance system and governance capacity, and
continuously improve the level of political civilization. The national governance system and
governance capacity are the concentrated embodiment of a country's political civilization.
Upholding the party's leadership, the people being masters of the country, and the organic unity of
governing the country according to law are the inevitable requirements of socialist political
civilization. The leadership of the CCP is the most essential feature of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the people's mastery of the country is the essence and core
of socialist democratic politics, and governing the country according to law is the basic way for the
party to lead the people to govern the country. We must adhere to the path of socialist political
development with Chinese characteristics, adhere to and improve the system of people's congresses,
the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
CCP, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of grassroots
mass autonomy. Consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic united front, develop socialist
consultative democracy, improve the democratic system, enrich democratic forms, broaden
democratic channels, ensure that the people's mastery of the country is implemented in the country's
political and social life, ensure that the people manage state affairs, economic and cultural
undertakings and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law,
continuously promote the building of socialist democratic politics and develop socialist political
civilization. Actively and steadily advance the reform of the political system, and promote the
institutionalization, standardization, rule of law, and procedural nature of socialist democratic
politics. By the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party, obvious results will be achieved in
making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped; by 2035, the system in all
aspects will be more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be
basically modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national
governance system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority will be fully displayed.

Third, efforts should be made to promote the construction of a culturally powerful country and
continuously improve the level of spiritual civilization. If culture is prosperous, the country is
prosperous, and a strong culture is a strong nation. To build a modern socialist country, we must
give full play to the guiding and supporting role of ideology and culture, and highlight the role of
spiritual civilization in social development as a spiritual driving force, ideological guarantee and
intellectual support. It is necessary to adhere to the path of socialist cultural development with
Chinese characteristics, stimulate the vitality of national cultural innovation and creativity, and build
a socialist cultural power. Firmly grasp the leadership of ideological work, cultivate and practice the
core socialist values, strengthen ideological and moral construction, prosper and develop socialist
literature and art, promote the coordinated development of cultural undertakings and cultural
industries, continuously enhance the soft power of national culture, continuously enhance the
influence of Chinese culture in the world, and continuously improve the ideological and moral level
and scientific and cultural level of the people.

Fourth, strive to achieve common prosperity and social fairness and justice, and continuously
improve the level of social civilization. Achieving common prosperity and social fairness and justice
is an important symbol of social civilization and an inevitable requirement for building a modern
and powerful socialist country. We must give priority to the development of education, improve the
quality of employment and the level of people's income, strengthen the construction of the social
security system, resolutely win the battle against poverty, implement the Healthy China strategy,
create a social governance pattern of joint construction, co-governance and sharing, and effectively
safeguard national security. Adhere to the bottom line, highlight key points, improve systems, guide
expectations, continuously narrow the gap between income, urban and rural areas, and regions,
basically realize the equalization of public services, ensure the basic life of the people, continuously
meet the people's growing needs for a better life, continuously promote social fairness and justice,
form effective social governance and good social order, and make the people's sense of gain,
happiness and security more fulfilling, more secure and more sustainable.

Fifth, focus on building a beautiful China and continuously improve the level of ecological
civilization. Socialist modernization is a modernization in which man and nature live in harmony.
We must firmly establish the concept of socialist ecological civilization, adhere to the principle of
giving priority to conservation, protection and natural restoration, and form a spatial pattern,
industrial structure, production mode and lifestyle for resource conservation and environmental
protection. Further advocate and promote the revolution of energy production and energy
consumption, accelerate the establishment of a legal system and policy guidance for green
production and consumption, establish and improve the economic system, green technology
innovation system and financial support system for green cycle and low-carbon development, truly
make green life a basic way of life, make the energy conservation and environmental protection
industry a leading industry for the development of the national economy, fundamentally improve
the ecological environment, and greatly improve the quality of ecological civilization in the whole
society.

To sum up, under the guidance of the strategic goal of building a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way, China will become a country with leading comprehensive national
strength and international influence by building a high degree of material, political, spiritual, social
and ecological civilization, so that the Chinese nation will stand tall among the nations of the world
with a more lofty attitude.
