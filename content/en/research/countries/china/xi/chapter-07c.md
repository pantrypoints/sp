3. the key to realizing the "two centenary goals" and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation

Since the 15th National Congress of the CCP first put forward the "two
centenary goals", the CCP has been working hard for them. Shortly after the
18th National Congress of the CCP in 2012, Comrade Xi Jinping clearly put
forward the new goal of "realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”

The 19th CPC National Congress made important arrangements for realizing the "two centenary
goals" and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out that reform and opening up is "a key move to decide to achieve the two centenary goals
and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." This is a new incisive summary of the
great role and significance of reform and opening up.

The achievement of any ambitious goal will not be smooth sailing. The great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation is by no means easy and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums. In the process
of building socialist modernization and striving toward the grand goal, there will always be various
difficulties and resistances. Some of these difficulties and obstacles come from the level of
institutional mechanisms, some from the level of ideology and concepts, and some from external
interference and obstruction. For more than 40 years, through reform and opening up, we have
boldly broken through the shackles of institutions and mechanisms, promoted the modernization of
the national governance system and governance capacity, and continuously broken the resistance
caused by outdated systems and mechanisms. Through reform and opening up, we have constantly
broken the shackles of rigid and conservative ideology and concepts, stood taller, seen farther, and
governed the country with a new perspective. Through reform and opening up, our comprehensive
national strength has continued to develop and grow, and we have the confidence and strength to
deal with such interference and sabotage, and "let the wind and waves rise and sit firmly on the
fishing boat." Looking forward to the future, in the journey of realizing the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we still need to
persevere in comprehensively deepening reform, continuously expanding opening up, and
constantly overcoming resistance and breaking waves.

At present, the environment at home and abroad is undergoing extremely extensive and profound
changes, China's development is facing a series of contradictions and challenges, and there are still
many difficulties and problems on the way forward. For example, the problems of imbalance,
incoordination and unsustainability in development are still prominent, the ability of scientific and
technological innovation is not strong, the industrial structure is irrational, the development mode
is still extensive, the gap between urban and rural development and the distribution of residents'
income is still large, social contradictions have increased significantly, education, employment,
social security, medical care, housing, ecological environment, food and drug safety, safe production,
social security, law enforcement and justice, and other problems related to the vital interests of the
masses are more, some people have difficulties in life, formalism and bureaucracy problems are
prominent, and so on. To solve these intertwined and complex contradictions and problems, resolve
risks and challenges from all sides, and promote sustained and healthy economic and social
development, we fundamentally rely on reform and opening up.

Without reform and opening up, there would be no China's today; without reform and opening up,
there would be no China's tomorrow.

Over the past 40 years and more, the CCP has united and led the people to
emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, boldly try and bravely reform, and create a new world.
Reform and opening up have greatly changed the face of China, the face of the Chinese nation, the
face of the Chinese people, and the face of the CCP. The Chinese nation has
ushered in a great leap from standing up and getting rich to becoming strong, socialism with Chinese
characteristics has ushered in a great leap from its founding, development to perfection, and the
Chinese people have ushered in a great leap from insufficient food and clothing to moderate
prosperity, and the Chinese nation is standing tall in the east of the world with a brand-new attitude.
Practice has proved that reform and opening up is the only way to strengthen the country and enrich
the people. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as long as we persist in holding
high the great banner of reform and opening up, constantly deepen our understanding of the laws of
reform and opening up, dare to face difficulties, dare to overcome difficulties, carry out reform and
opening up to the end, and constantly realize the people's yearning for a better life, we can create
new and greater miracles that will impress the world, realize the "two centenary goals" and realize
the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as scheduled.
