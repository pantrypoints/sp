2. the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform

Since the reform and opening up, the CCP has governed the country from a
new perspective, attached great importance to system building, and emphasized that institutional
issues are more fundamental, overall, stable and long-term. The Party Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, with great political courage and wisdom, put forward the overall
goal of comprehensively deepening reform with the overall goal of improving and developing the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity. This general goal responds to the objective
requirements put forward by the forward expansion of the reform process, embodies the deepening
and systematization of the party's understanding of reform, and is a major breakthrough in the party's
theoretical innovation process.

A deep understanding and accurate grasp of the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform
is the key to implementing various reform measures. In response to some people who only talk about
the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, while ignoring
"improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics", Comrade Xi Jinping
stressed that the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform is a whole composed of two
sentences. The latter sentence stipulates a clear orientation for improving and developing the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics under the guidance of the fundamental direction.
Speaking both sentences is complete. To speak only the second sentence and not the first is
incomplete and incomplete."1

Improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics has laid down the
fundamental direction for comprehensively deepening reform. Promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is an inevitable requirement for improving and
developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and it is also the proper meaning of
adhering to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and building a modern and powerful
socialist country.

The national governance system and governance capacity are the concentrated embodiment of a
country's system and system implementation ability. The national governance system is the
institutional system for managing the country under the leadership of the party, and the national
governance capacity is the ability to use the national system to manage all aspects of social affairs.
The national governance system and governance capacity are an organic whole and complement
each other, and only with a good national governance system can we improve governance capacity,
and only by improving national governance capacity can we give full play to the effectiveness of
the national governance system. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We have talked about many
modernizations, including agricultural modernization, industrial modernization, scientific and
technological modernization, national defense modernization, etc., and the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is the first time.”1 The modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is the result of the Party's continuous
deepening of understanding of the laws governing the country in the practice of leading reform and
opening up, and marks a major innovation and development of the theory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

From the perspective of historical development, how to govern a brand-new society such as a
socialist society has not been well solved in the past practice of world socialism. In the process of
leading China's revolution and construction, the CCP has constantly
considered and explored what kind of national governance system to establish in the future and
achieved important results. Since the reform and opening up, more attention has been paid to
institutional construction, a complete set of national governance systems has been basically formed,
and governance capabilities have been continuously improved. On the whole, China's national
governance system and governance capacity have unique advantages and are adapted to national
conditions and development requirements. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has coordinated
the reform of systems and mechanisms in various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society,
and ecological civilization, involving an unprecedented scope, introducing many plans, touching on
the depth of interests, and promoting unprecedented intensity, improving the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics, and significantly improving the modernization level of the national
governance system and governance capacity.

At the same time, we must also realize that compared with China's economic and social development
and the requirements of the people, compared with the increasingly fierce international competition
in today's world, and compared with the realization of long-term peace and stability of the country,
we still have many areas for urgent improvement in the national governance system and governance
capacity, and the system has not yet reached the requirements of full maturity and stereotype, and
some aspects have even become an important factor restricting development and stability. Therefore,
we must continuously improve the national governance system and improve the ability to use the
system to effectively govern the country through comprehensive deepening reform. In February
2014, in a speech at the seminar for major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to
study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee and
comprehensively deepen reform, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Today, a major historical task
before us is to promote the socialist system with Chinese characteristics to be more mature and more
formalized, and to provide a complete set of more complete, stable and effective institutional
systems for the development of the cause of the party and the country, for the happiness and well-
being of the people, for social harmony and stability, and for the long-term peace and stability of
the country."1 From the point of view of becoming a more mature and stereotyped system, the main
historical task of socialism in our country in the past was to establish a basic socialist system and
carry out reform on this basis. The main historical task in the future is to improve and develop the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee held in October 2019 focused on
the theme of "adhering to and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,
promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity", starting
from the strategic goals and major tasks established by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, focusing on adhering to and consolidating the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics, ensuring the long-term rule of the Party and the long-term peace and stability of the
country, and focusing on improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Comprehensively building a modern socialist country, focusing on giving full play to the superiority
of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, promoting the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity, comprehensively sums up the achievements,
accumulated experience and principles formed by the party and the people in the construction of
China's national system and national governance, focuses on adhering to and improving the
fundamental, basic and important systems that support the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics, and deploys major institutional reforms that need to be deepened and key tasks that
need to be promoted. The plenary session not only pointed out the great significance and overall
requirements for adhering to and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and
promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, but also
summarized the significant advantages of China's state system and national governance system from
13 aspects

It also made arrangements on how to uphold and improve the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics and promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capacity from 13 aspects, including adhering to and improving the party's leadership system. On the
basis of the "two-step" strategic arrangement made by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee further clarified that
the adherence to and improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, The overall
goal of promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity is
to achieve obvious results in making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped
by the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party; by 2035, the system in all aspects will be
more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be basically
modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national governance
system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority fully displayed. This further clarifies
the internal logic of the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform and the ideas for future
development.

To promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity in the
new era, it is necessary to adapt to the changes of the times, constantly reform the systems and
mechanisms that do not meet the requirements of practical development, and make the various
systems and mechanisms more scientific and perfect in the process of innovation; it is necessary to
continuously improve the party's level of scientific governance, democratic governance, and ruling
according to law, improve the ability of state institutions to perform their duties, and enhance the
ability of the people to manage state affairs, economic, social, and cultural affairs, and their own
affairs according to law; and it is necessary to improve the ideological and political, scientific, and
cultural quality of cadres at all levels and managers in all fields as soon as possible. It is necessary
to enhance the work ability of party and state organs, enterprises and institutions, people's
organizations, social organizations, and so on as soon as possible; proceed from the actual conditions
of our country and creatively study and draw on all the excellent achievements of human civilization.
3. important arrangements for comprehensively deepening reform
Comprehensively deepening reform is a major strategic deployment related to the overall
development of the cause of the party and the country, not a reform in a certain field or aspect, but
needs to be promoted in an overall manner, strengthening top-level design and overall planning.
Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has scientifically formulated a blueprint for reform, carefully
drawn up a road map for reform, firmly grasped the key point of economic system reform, and
promoted the comprehensive deepening of reform to continue to develop in depth.
The road map for comprehensively deepening reform is to achieve the "six tight surrounds" clearly
put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China under the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform.

The first is to deepen the reform of the economic system around making the market play a decisive
role in the allocation of resources, adhere to and improve the basic economic system, accelerate the
improvement of the modern market system, macro-control system and open economic system,
accelerate the transformation of economic development mode, accelerate the construction of an
innovative country, and promote more efficient, fairer and more sustainable economic development.
The second is to deepen the reform of the political system closely centering on adhering to the party's
leadership, the people being masters of the country, and the organic unity of governing the country
according to law, accelerate the institutionalization, standardization and procedure of socialist
democratic politics, build a socialist country under the rule of law, and develop a broader, fuller and
more sound people's democracy. The third is to deepen the reform of the cultural system closely
centering on the construction of the socialist core value system and the socialist cultural power,
accelerate the improvement of the cultural management system and cultural production and
operation mechanism, establish and improve the modern public cultural service system and modern
cultural market system, and promote the great development and prosperity of socialist culture. The
fourth is to deepen the reform of the social system around better protection and improvement of
people's livelihood, promote social fairness and justice, reform the income distribution system,
promote common prosperity, promote institutional innovation in the social field, promote the
equalization of basic public services, accelerate the formation of a scientific and effective social
governance system, and ensure that the society is both vibrant and harmonious and orderly. The fifth
is to deepen the reform of the ecological civilization system closely around the construction of a
beautiful China, accelerate the establishment of the ecological civilization system, improve the
institutional mechanisms for land space development, resource conservation and utilization, and
ecological environmental protection, and promote the formation of a new pattern of harmonious
development and modernization of man and nature. Sixth, closely centering on improving the level
of scientific governance, democratic governance, and ruling according to law, deepen the reform of
the party building system, strengthen the construction of democratic centralism, improve the party's
leadership system and ruling methods, maintain the party's advanced nature and purity, and provide
a strong political guarantee for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. On the one hand,
this reform roadmap clarifies the main contents of comprehensively deepening reform and
highlights the comprehensiveness of reform; on the other hand, it clarifies the key points of reform
in the economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and party building fields, so that the top-level
design, priority order, key areas and key links of comprehensively deepening reform are clear at a
glance, which is conducive to the combination and promotion of overall promotion and key
breakthroughs.
To comprehensively deepen reform, we must persistently focus on economic structural reform.
China's basic national conditions are still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain for a
long time, which determines that economic construction is the party's long-term central task. We
must unswervingly persist in taking economic construction as the central task, and we must
unswervingly adhere to the focus on economic structural reform. To promote the reform of the
economic system, we must adhere to the direction of socialist market economic reform, and in
particular, we must properly handle the core issue of the relationship between the government and
the market.

In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the CCP put forward that the goal of
economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market economic system, and proposed that the
market should play a basic role in the allocation of resources under the state's macro-control. This
major theoretical breakthrough has played an extremely important role in China's reform, opening
up, and economic and social development. Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party has continuously deepened its understanding of the relationship between
the government and the market. The 15th National Congress of the CCP
proposed "making the market play a basic role in the allocation of resources under the state's macro-
control", the 16th National Congress of the CCP proposed "giving greater
play to the basic role of the market in the allocation of resources", the 17th National Congress of the
CCP proposed "giving better play to the basic role of the market in the
allocation of resources from the perspective of system", and the 18th National Congress of the
CCP proposed "giving greater play to the basic role of the market in resource
allocation to a greater extent and on a wider scale.” The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central
Committee of the CCP clearly proposed to "make the market play a decisive
role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government.” This is another major
breakthrough in theory and practice by the party, which is conducive to establishing a correct
concept of the relationship between the government and the market in the whole party and society,
to changing the mode of economic development, to changing government functions, and to curbing
negative and corrupt phenomena. The market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources, not
the whole role. To develop the socialist market economy, it is necessary to give play to both the role
of the market and the role of the government, but the functions of the role of the market and the role
of the government are different. The Party Central Committee put forward clear requirements for
better playing the role of the government, emphasizing that "the duties and roles of the government
are mainly to maintain macroeconomic stability, strengthen and optimize public services, ensure fair
competition, strengthen market supervision, maintain market order, promote sustainable
development, promote prosperity, and make up for market failures."1
Persist in taking economic structural reform as the traction to drive reform in other fields. The
economic base determines the superstructure. Economic structural reform has an important
influence and transmission effect on reform in other fields, and the progress of major economic
structural reform determines the progress of structural reform in other fields, and has the effect of
affecting the whole body. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "In comprehensively deepening reform,
we must adhere to the reform of the economic system as the main axis, strive to make new
breakthroughs in the reform of important areas and key links, so as to drive and drive reform in
other fields, so that all aspects of reform can be promoted in a coordinated manner and form a joint
force, rather than separate and scattered efforts." 2 Since the 18th National Congress of the
CCP.

With the reform of the economic system as the traction, we have led to the reform of the political,
cultural, social and ecological civilization system, the reform of the party and state institutions, the
reform of the administrative management system, the reform of the system of governing the country
according to law, the reform of the judicial system, the reform of the foreign affairs system, the
reform of the social governance system, the reform of the ecological environment supervision
system, the reform of the national security system, the reform of the national defense and the army,
the reform of the party leadership and party building system, the reform of the discipline inspection
and supervision system, and a series of major reforms have been solidly advanced. A good situation
for in-depth advancement.
