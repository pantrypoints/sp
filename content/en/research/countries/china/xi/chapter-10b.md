To promote the prosperity of socialist culture, it is necessary to take Marxism as the guide, adhere to the stand of Chinese culture, base ourselves on the reality of contemporary China, and combine the conditions of the current era to develop a national, scientific and popular socialist culture oriented to modernization, the world and the future, and constantly create new splendor of Chinese culture. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "While building a high degree of material civilization, we should also raise the scientific and cultural level of the whole nation, develop a noble and rich and colorful cultural life, and build a high degree of socialist spiritual civilization."1


1. Strengthen faith in Marxism

The people have faith, the country has strength, and the nation has hope. Marxism is the guiding
ideology of the party and the state, and a powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world,
grasp the laws, pursue the truth, and transform the world. To prosper and develop socialist culture,
the most fundamental thing is to continue to strengthen theoretical arming work, strengthen Marxist
belief, use the developing Marxism to guide new practice, and give full play to the role of the party's
scientific theories in guiding the direction, refining thinking, sublimating the realm, and promoting
work.

Doing a good job in strengthening Marxist propaganda and education is the fundamental
requirement for holding high the banner of Marxism and building people's faith and conviction. "To
do a good job" lies in following the requirements of Marxist popularization, unifying propaganda
education with satisfying the theoretical needs of the masses, adopting ways and means that conform
to the habits of the masses, realizing the effective integration of theoretical discourse and mass
discourse, and carrying out more targeted and effective theoretical dissemination and ideological
enlightenment, so that Marxist theory can better be recognized by the audience's hearts and become
people's actions to follow. "To be stronger", the emphasis is on pooling propaganda and education
resources from all aspects, and forming an all-round work pattern that combines inner-party
education and social education, online communication and offline communication, and theoretical
propaganda and practical cultivation.

We should always maintain the strength of propaganda and public opinion, and fully demonstrate
the truth power and ideological brilliance of Marxism.

Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the inheritance and
development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important
thinking of "three represents" and the scientific outlook on development, the latest achievement of
the Sinicization of Marxism, and the action guide for the whole party and the people of all ethnic
groups throughout the country to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In
contemporary China, adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for
a New Era is truly adhering to Marxism. To do a good job in strengthening Marxist propaganda and
education, the first task is to arm the whole party, educate the people, and promote the work with
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is necessary to
make efforts to learn and understand and do practical things, adhere to comprehensive and
systematic study, timely follow-up study, in-depth thinking and practical study, guide people to
deeply understand the historical status, rich connotation and spiritual essence of Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, continuously enhance the political,
ideological and emotional identification with this thought, better transform the achievements of the
party's theoretical innovation into a powerful force for understanding and transforming the world,
and promote contemporary Chinese Marxism.21Century Marxism took root.

2. Cultivate and practice the core socialist values

Core values carry the spiritual pursuit of a nation and a country, embody a value standard for social
judgment of the merits, and are an important stabilizer of a country. China is a large country with a
population of 1.4 billion and 56 ethnic groups, and the establishment of the "greatest common
denominator" of values that reflect the common recognition of the people of all ethnic groups in the
country, so that all the people can work together with one heart and one mind, and forge ahead in
unity, which is related to the future and destiny of the country and the happiness and well-being of
the people.

Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, the CCP
has advocated the core socialist values of prosperity, democracy, civilization, harmony, freedom,
equality, justice, rule of law, patriotism, dedication, honesty and friendliness, and has answered in
depth the major questions of what kind of country to build, what kind of society to build and what
kind of citizens to cultivate from the three levels of state, society and citizens. The core values of
socialism embody the common value pursuit of all the people and are the concentrated embodiment
of the spirit of contemporary China.

The 19th National Congress of the CCP pointed out that to cultivate and
practice the core socialist values, we should focus on cultivating new people of the era who will take
on the task of national rejuvenation, and grasp the essence of cultivating and practicing the core
socialist values. This is because what kind of society to build and what kind of goals to achieve are
the decisive factor; the construction of socialist core values depends in the final analysis on people's
ideological and moral construction and scientific and cultural construction. It is necessary to adhere
to the way of education guidance, practice cultivation, and system guarantee, based on the
cultivation of new talents of the era with ideals, skills, and responsibilities, and continue to deeply
promote the construction of socialist core values.

Strengthen education and guidance. This is the most basic and effective way to cultivate and practice
the core socialist values. It is necessary to strengthen ideological and moral construction, thoroughly
implement the project of building civic morality, strengthen and improve ideological and political
work, and continuously enhance the people's ideological consciousness, moral level, civilization
attainment, and the level of civilization of the whole society. It is necessary to better integrate the
core socialist values into national education, integrate them into education and teaching, school spirit
and study style, and lead the construction of teachers' morality. Build and improve a scientific,
rational and closely connected moral education system from primary school to university, and grasp
the education of socialist core values as the central link of moral education in schools, so that it
becomes a custom and a habit. Persist in educating people with culture and culture, deeply excavate,
inherit and innovate excellent traditional local culture, carry forward new trends and healthy trends,
promote the change of customs and customs, cultivate civilized rural customs, good family customs,
simple folk customs, and rejuvenate the new atmosphere of rural civilization. It is necessary to
infiltrate the core socialist values into all links of the creation, production and dissemination of
spiritual and cultural products, and subtly enhance people's identification with the core socialist
values through various channels such as film and television programs, news reports, and special
programs.

Focus on practice cultivation. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that for a value to really play a role,
it must be integrated into social life, so that people can perceive it and comprehend it in practice.
We must persist in closely linking the core socialist values with people's daily lives, and make efforts
to implement them in detail, small and small. Give play to the leading role of the creation of spiritual
civilization, take the cultivation and practice of socialist core values as the fundamental task of the
creation of spiritual civilization, embody it in all aspects of the activities of building civilized cities,
civilized villages and towns, civilized units, civilized families, and civilized campuses, mobilize the
whole society to participate and act together, and deeply integrate it with people's daily production
and life, and become the code of conduct that all people use every day without realizing it. We
should be good at cultivating and discovering typical figures and typical events that practice the
core values of socialism in social life, highlight the good deeds of ordinary people who demonstrate
the core values of socialism, and use "role models around us" to drive people around us to influence
people around us.

The vast number of party members and cadres should take the lead in studying and carrying forward
the core socialist values, and inspire and motivate the masses with their exemplary behavior and
noble personality. Popularize the concept of volunteer service in the whole society, widely carry out
various volunteer service activities, cultivate a social atmosphere of everyone and everyone for me,
and achieve the unity of knowledge and action in cultivating and practicing the core socialist values.
Integrate into the construction of the rule of law. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to
use the law to promote the construction of core values, pay attention to reflecting value orientation
in daily management, so that behaviors that conform to core values are encouraged and behaviors
that violate core values are curbed. Give full play to the guarantee role of laws and policies, integrate
the core socialist values into the entire process of building a country ruled by law, a government
ruled by law, and a society ruled by law, running through all aspects of legislation, law enforcement,
justice, and law-abiding. It is necessary to use legal means to correctly guide social value judgments,
not only to protect the fundamental interests of the people, but also to severely punish malicious
acts that endanger social morality and social creditworthiness, so as to provide effective legal
guarantees for social governance and moral protocols. Carry out in-depth special education and
governance on prominent issues in the field of ethics, punish malicious violations of social morality
and morality in accordance with law, and strive to make the process of social governance a process
of cultivating and practicing socialist core values. It is necessary to formulate a legal system to
promote civilized behavior of citizens, guide and promote the whole people to establish a clear
concept, promote the change of customs, and advocate a civilized new style.
