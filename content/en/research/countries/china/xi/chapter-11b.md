3. the new goal of promoting social construction at a new starting point

In the face of the new situation of social construction in the new era, the 19th National Congress of
the CCP made systematic arrangements for promoting social construction,
emphasizing that "we must always put the interests of the people in the supreme position, so that
the results of reform and development can benefit all the people more and more equitably, and
continue to move forward towards realizing the common prosperity of all the people"; a more
fulfilling, secure and sustainable sense of security.”1

The 19th National Congress of the CCP also put forward a more long-term
goal pursuit for promoting social construction in the "two-step" strategic arrangement of building a
modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way. In the strategic deployment of basically
realizing socialist modernization from 2020 to 2035, it is clearly proposed that by 2035, the rule of
law society will be basically completed and the degree of social civilization will reach a new height;
The people's living standards have become more prosperous, the proportion of middle-income
groups has increased significantly; the gap between urban and rural development and residents'
living standards has been significantly narrowed, the equalization of basic public services has been
basically realized, and the common prosperity of all the people has taken solid steps. The governance
pattern of modern society has basically taken shape, and the society is full of vitality and harmony
and order. In the strategic plan of building a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious
and beautiful modern socialist power from 2035 to the middle of this century, it is clearly proposed
that by the middle of this century, material, political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations
will be comprehensively improved, the national governance system and governance capacity will
be modernized, the common prosperity of all the people will be basically realized, and the Chinese
people will enjoy a happier and healthier life.
The task goal of social construction at a new starting point established by the 19th National Congress
of the CCP demonstrates the Party's strong historical responsibility and the
Party's ambition to promote China's social progress.

To achieve such a task goal, we must always adhere to the principled position of putting the interests
of the people first. Seeking happiness for the people is the original intention of the Party, and leading
the people to create a better life is the fundamental focus of the Party in promoting social
construction. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The Communist Party seeks happiness for the
people, and wherever the people feel unhappy, unhappy and dissatisfied, we will work hard in every
possible way to solve problems for the masses."1 It is necessary to seek more benefits for the people's
livelihood and relieve more worries about the people's livelihood, make up for the shortcomings of
the people's livelihood in the process of development, promote social fairness and justice, and
continuously make new progress in providing education for the young, learning and teaching,
earning income from hard work, treating the sick, providing for the elderly, housing and housing,
and supporting the weak, so as to ensure that all the people have a greater sense of gain in joint
construction and shared development, and constantly promote the all-round development of people
and the common prosperity of all the people.
To achieve such mission goals, we must unswervingly promote fairness and justice. Fairness and
justice are intrinsic requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The prominent problem
of social injustice will inevitably directly cause or aggravate social contradictions, and even cause
social crises, leaving society in a state of instability.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The central government comprehensively examined and
scientifically analyzed the current situation and situation of China's economic and social
development, and believes that if this problem is not solved urgently, it will not only affect the
people's confidence in reform and opening up, but also affect social harmony and stability."1 We
must intensify reform, take the promotion of social fairness and justice and the improvement of
people's well-being as a mirror, examine various institutional mechanisms and policy regulations,
and promote reform wherever there are problems that do not conform to social fairness and justice;
Through innovative institutional arrangements, efforts should be made to overcome violations of
fairness and justice caused by human factors, create a fair and just social environment, and make
real progress in promoting equal rights, fair opportunities, and fair rules.
To achieve such a task goal, we must focus on forming effective social governance and good social
order. This is an important aspect of promoting the modernization of the national governance system
and governance capacity, and it is also an urgent task to promote reform and development and
maintain social and political stability. It is necessary to deeply study the phased characteristics of
China's social transformation period, deeply study the law of modern social governance, broaden
work ideas, improve institutional mechanisms, and continuously improve the scientific level of
social governance. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the social governance system,
improve the social governance system under the leadership of the party committee, the government
is responsible, social coordination, public participation, and the guarantee of the rule of law,
strengthen the construction of mechanisms for preventing and resolving social conflicts, accelerate
the construction of the social security prevention and control system, strengthen the construction of
the social psychological service system, strengthen the construction of the community governance
system, promote the focus of social governance to the grassroots level, give play to the role of social
organizations, realize the benign interaction between government governance and social regulation
and residents' autonomy, ensure that the society is both vibrant and harmonious and orderly, and
ensure the long-term peace and stability of the country. The people live and work in peace and
contentment.
