2. Promote employment and entrepreneurship. Employment is the economic foundation and basic guarantee for people's survival, as well as the basic condition for integration into society.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that "employment is the biggest project of people's livelihood,
people's heart, and foundation.”

Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, China's employment work has
made great achievements, with an average of 13 million new jobs created every year, and the urban
survey unemployment rate has been maintained within 5%, achieving relatively full employment
nationwide.

Facing the new situation of employment and entrepreneurship in the new era, we must strive to
achieve higher quality and fuller employment. It is necessary to put the employment priority strategy
at the macro policy level, take the employment priority strategy and the active employment policy
as the guide, and make joint efforts in full employment, decent employment and harmonious
employment. In terms of full employment, establish a linkage mechanism for economic
development and employment expansion, and improve the government's responsibility system for
promoting employment. 

Entrepreneurship is the main channel for creating new jobs. It is necessary to continuously improve the support policies for entrepreneurship, and form a new mechanism for the government to encourage entrepreneurship, social support for entrepreneurship, and workers to have the courage to start a business by continuing to promote "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", and promote multi-channel employment and entrepreneurship of young groups such as college graduates and migrant workers. Carry out large-scale vocational skills training, comprehensively improve the quality of workers, and pay attention to solving structural employment contradictions. Improve employment services, improve the public employment and entrepreneurship service system that equalizes urban and rural areas, and strengthen the unemployment insurance system's function of preventing unemployment and promoting employment. In terms of decent employment and harmonious employment, we will eliminate the shortcomings of the system and mechanism that hinder the social mobility of labor and talent, so that everyone has the opportunity to achieve their own development through hard work. Improve the consultation and coordination mechanism for the government, trade unions and enterprises to participate in the consultation, smooth the channels for employees to express their reasonable demands, build harmonious labor relations, advocate the spirit of model workers and craftsmen, and enable everyone to engage in a dignified job.

3. Narrow the income gap. 

Income is the source of people's livelihood, and it is the most
important and direct way to improve people's livelihood and realize that the fruits of development
are shared by the people. Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, the
income gap between urban and rural residents, the income gap between regional residents, and the
average wage gap of the national industry have narrowed to a certain extent, the Gini coefficient has
declined, the growth rate of urban and rural residents' income is significantly faster than the growth
rate of 00?, and the growth rate of per capita disposable income of rural residents is significantly
faster than the growth rate of per capita disposable income of urban residents, indicating that China's
income gap has shown a good trend of continuous narrowing.
The reform of the income distribution system concerns the vital interests of the broad masses and
must be properly grasped and steadily promoted

It is necessary to persist in deepening the reform of the income distribution system, rationally adjust
the income distribution relationship between the government, enterprises and residents,
continuously narrow the gap between urban and rural areas, regions and rich and poor, and further
promote more reasonable and orderly income distribution. In terms of primary distribution,
emphasis should be placed on protecting labor income, striving to synchronize the growth of labor
remuneration with the increase in labor productivity, and increasing the proportion of labor
remuneration in primary distribution; improving the mechanism for determining wages and normal
growth, improving the minimum wage and wage payment guarantee system, and improving the
system of collective wage negotiation in enterprises; improving the remuneration mechanism
determined by the factor market such as capital, knowledge, technology, and management; and
increasing residents' property income through multiple channels. In terms of redistribution, improve
the redistribution adjustment mechanism with taxation, social security, and transfer payments as the
main means, and increase the intensity of tax regulation. In terms of regulating the order of income
distribution, establish an information system for personal income and property, protect legitimate
income, regulate excessive income, clean up and regulate hidden income, ban illegal income,
increase the income of low-income people, expand the scale of middle-income groups, gradually
form an olive-shaped distribution pattern, and ultimately achieve common prosperity.

4. Strengthen the construction of the social security system. Social security is a basic livelihood
system, a social safety net and stabilizer. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China, the social security system covering urban and rural residents has been basically established,
the development concept, development mode and governance mechanism of social security work
have been continuously reformed, innovated, transformed and improved, and new progress has been
made in the construction of social assistance, social insurance and social welfare, and the sense of
gain of the broad masses of the people has been significantly enhanced.

China's social security system has been basically established, which is a remarkable achievement,
but there are still imbalances and insufficient contradictions between different security systems,
between different regions and between different groups of people in terms of security scope, security
level, service capacity and service quality. In accordance with the requirements of the 19th National
Congress of the CCP to build a bottom-line, dense network and mechanism,
a multi-level social security system covering the whole people, coordinating urban and rural areas,
with clear powers and responsibilities, and appropriate and sustainable guarantees has a lot of work
to be done in practice. It is necessary to establish a unified national social insurance public service
platform, integrate the basic old-age insurance system for urban and rural residents, and improve
the unified basic medical insurance system for urban and rural residents and the serious illness
insurance system; promote the overall development of the urban and rural minimum subsistence
guarantee system; improve the policy of transferring and continuing social insurance relations,
expand the coverage of insurance contributions, and appropriately reduce social insurance premiums
in a timely manner; improve the care and service system for left-behind rural children, women and
the elderly, and improve the protection of the rights and interests of the disabled and the categorical
guarantee system for children in difficulty. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the personal
account system, improve the incentive mechanism for overpayment and more reward, ensure the
rights and interests of the insured, and realize the national pooling of endowment insurance as soon
as possible;

Research and formulate a policy of gradually delaying the retirement age; accelerate the
development of enterprise annuities, occupational annuities, and commercial insurance, and build a
multi-level social security system. Attach great importance to the housing issue, adhere to the
fundamental positioning pointed out by Comrade Xi Jinping that "houses are for living, not for
speculation", and establish a multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, and rent-purchase
housing system, so that the people can truly live and live.

5. Implement the Healthy China Strategy. 

The well-being of all is the cornerstone of the prosperity of a nation. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "people first, life first, protecting people's life safety and health can be done at any cost"1. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the health and medical standards of our people have been greatly improved, the life
expectancy of the population has been continuously improved, the comprehensive two-child policy
has been liberalized in a timely manner, and a modern hospital management system, a universal
medical insurance system, a drug supply guarantee system and a comprehensive supervision system
are taking shape. Successfully prepared and responded to sudden outbreaks such as influenza
A(H1N1), H7N9, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever; After arduous efforts, the situation of the new crown
pneumonia epidemic has been effectively reversed, and major strategic results have been achieved
in the epidemic prevention and control battle.

To implement the Healthy China Strategy, we must strive to achieve the well-being of all and the
sustainable development of the nation. It is necessary to run the concept of health management
throughout the whole process of urban planning, construction and management. Deepen the reform
of the medical and health care system, and make overall plans to promote the comprehensive reform
of medical security, medical services, public health, drug supply, and regulatory systems. In terms
of medical security, deepen the comprehensive reform of grassroots medical and health institutions,
and improve the operation mechanism of networked urban and rural primary medical and health
services. Accelerate the reform of public hospitals and implement government responsibilities. In
terms of medical services, improve the reasonable hierarchical diagnosis and treatment model, and
establish a contractual service relationship between community doctors and residents. Make full use
of information technology to promote the vertical flow of high-quality medical resources. In terms
of public health, reform and improve the disease prevention and control system, the major epidemic
prevention and control treatment system, and improve the unified emergency material support
system. Vigorously carry out patriotic health campaigns, promote the transformation from
environmental sanitation governance to comprehensive social health management, and advocate
civilized, healthy, green and environmentally friendly lifestyles. In terms of drug supply, we will
completely abolish the use of medicine to support doctors, rationalize the price of medicine, and
establish a scientific compensation mechanism;

Adhere to the equal importance of Chinese and Western medicine, strengthen the combing and
excavation of the essence of classical medicine, and promote the research and development of new
Chinese medicine and industrial development. In terms of the medical insurance system, improve
the universal medical insurance system, accelerate the improvement of the medical insurance and
assistance system for serious and extraordinarily serious diseases, and encourage the society to run
medical services. Implement food safety strategies to make people feel at ease. In terms of
population aging, actively respond to the aging of the population, build a policy system and social
environment for the elderly, filial piety and respect for the elderly, accelerate the development of
enterprise annuities, occupational annuities, commercial endowment insurance, etc. in addition to
the basic pension system, and work together in economic support, daily life care and psychological
comfort, so as to fully realize the elderly and enjoy the elderly.
