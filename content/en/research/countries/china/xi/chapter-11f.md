2. actively promote innovation in the pattern of social governance

Modern social governance is not only the process of the government providing public services to
the society and regulating and regulating relevant social affairs in accordance with the law, but also
the process of social self-service and self-regulation and regulation in accordance with law and
morality. This requires continuously improving the government's social management capabilities
and effectiveness, while continuously enhancing social self-management capabilities, and making
every effort to create a social governance pattern of joint construction, co-governance and sharing
by improving the social governance system of party committee leadership, government
responsibility, social coordination, public participation, and legal guarantee.

The fundamental feature of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics is the leadership
of the Party. In this respect, we are fundamentally different from the social governance of Western
capitalism. In China, the CCP has a broad and profound social and mass
foundation, and its party organizations cover the whole society, extend to the grassroots level, and
play a leading core role in political, economic, cultural and social life, which is essentially different
from the nature and role of Western political parties. State-owned enterprises and institutions are
important pillars of social governance and public services, and their nature is different from those
of industry associations in Western countries. Workers' and young women's mass organizations are
bridges and links between the Party and the government and the masses, covering all aspects of
political, economic, cultural and social life, and are different from those non-governmental
organizations in the West.

Neighborhood committees, village committees and other grassroots people's autonomous
organizations not only undertake a large number of social service functions, but also undertake some
social governance functions, which is different from the nature of autonomous organizations in the
West. Most importantly, these organizations work under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party. These differences and differences determine that to strengthen and innovate social governance,
it is necessary to strengthen and improve the leadership of party committees at all levels over social
governance, and enhance the party's overall planning and organizational ability for social
governance. The party should not only do a good job in leading and leading social governance work,
but also do a good job in guiding work and play the role of "leading geese.” Leadership does not
mean direct command, nor does it mean doing everything; we must make efforts to organically
combine "unification" and "division" and give full play to our political and institutional advantages.
Social governance is mainly the responsibility of the government. The government's responsibility
is not led by the government, not in the traditional sense of control, but to do a good job in public
services, public management, public security, and improve the mechanism of interest expression,
interest coordination, and interest protection. It is necessary to fully implement the main
responsibility of social governance of governments at all levels, and ensure that personnel, input,
work, and responsibility are in place for public services and public management that should be the
responsibility of the government. It is necessary to standardize the social governance functions of
all government departments, effectively solve the problem of multi-headed management and
decentralized management in some fields, especially the problem of prevarication when
encountering difficult things, and form a chain of social governance responsibility with clear powers
and responsibilities, clear rewards and punishments, division of labor and responsibility, and joint
management.

Strengthen social collaboration. Social coordination is mainly to solve the problem of joint
construction and co-governance. It is necessary to innovate the idea of social governance, expand
the opening up of the public service market, encourage and guide enterprises, institutions, social
organizations, and the people to actively participate in social governance through methods such as
government procurement of services and improvement of incentive and compensation mechanisms,
so as to create a social governance community where everyone is responsible and everyone is
responsible. It is necessary to deepen the governance of grassroots organizations and departments
and industries according to law, support all kinds of social subjects in self-restraint and self-
management, and give play to the positive role of social norms such as citizens' conventions,
township rules and people's conventions, industry regulations, and group charters in social
governance. It is necessary to pay attention to the cultivation and guidance of social organizations,
reform the management system of social organizations, promote social organizations to clarify their
rights and responsibilities, regulate self-discipline, and exercise autonomy in accordance with law,
actively participate in social governance and public services, and better give play to the social
governance functions of all people's organizations.
Focus on public participation. Comrade Xi Jinping has pointed out many times that the people are
the creators of history, and the masses are the real heroes. The masses of the people are the main
source of all social vitality.

In order to achieve the goal of social governance innovation for the masses, we must believe in the
masses, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses, so that the broad masses of the people will
become the main force of social governance innovation. It is necessary to stimulate the infinite
vitality and innovation contained in the broad masses of the people, mobilize and organize the
masses to participate in public services and public management in a rational and orderly manner in
accordance with the law, realize self-management, self-service and self-development, and promote
the formation of a good situation in which everyone participates in social governance and everyone
shares a harmonious society.

3. Actively promote innovation in social governance methods

To strengthen and innovate social governance, we must innovate social governance methods and
continuously improve the level of socialization, rule of law, intelligence and specialization of social governance.

The socialization of social governance requires all kinds of social subjects, especially the broad
masses of the people, to become the most active and dynamic factor in social governance. In social
governance, it is necessary to fully respect the autonomy, enthusiasm and creativity of all kinds of
subjects, especially the people, rely on the wisdom and independent innovation of the broad masses
of the people, improve the pattern of social governance, and maintain the overall stability of society.
On the one hand, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the interests of the
government and the masses, and prevent and reduce social contradictions from the source. It is
necessary to regard the affairs of the masses of the people as their own affairs, so that the masses
can sincerely feel that problems can be reflected, contradictions can be resolved, and rights and
interests are guaranteed. On the other hand, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of the people
to participate in social governance through various forms, effectively give play to the self-
governance function of grassroots mass autonomous organizations, establish and improve all kinds
of villagers and residents' spontaneous social organizations, encourage the development of mass
organizations in the category of life services, voluntary services, and maintenance of public order,
and let the people become firm supporters and important participants in social governance
innovation.

The rule of law in social governance is an inevitable requirement of social governance. The
relationship between people's rights and obligations in social governance needs to be regulated by
law, and contradictions and disputes need to be resolved by law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out:
"Improving the system that plays a major role in safeguarding the vital interests of the masses,
strengthening the authoritative position of the law in resolving contradictions, and making the
masses sincerely feel that their rights and interests have been treated fairly and effectively
safeguarded."1 It is necessary to guide social governance innovation with the concept of rule of law,
firmly establish the concept of governance according to law, and strive to create a fair social
environment from the legal, institutional and policy aspects;

Effectively guarantee the equal status of the people in politics, law, opportunity, rights and
distribution. It is also necessary to guide the whole society to believe in the law and establish an
authoritative position of the law in the hearts of the people. It is necessary to improve the legal
system, strengthen judicial supervision, and promptly discover, stop, and correct violations of laws
and regulations and practices that may occur in the process of social governance innovation. It is
necessary to improve the legal system for the protection of citizens' rights, and strengthen legislative
protection in areas such as income distribution, housing, education, medical system reform, rural
land acquisition, urban housing demolition, labor contract signing, and protection of the rights and
interests of migrant workers.

Intelligent social governance is a key means to promote the modernization of social governance.
The vigorous development of various new technologies represented by new information technology
has brought new challenges to social governance and provided new momentum and opportunities
for innovative social governance. It is necessary to conform to the development tide of the Internet
era and improve the level of intelligent social governance. Make good use of high and new
technologies such as the Internet of Everything, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
to make the social governance process more scientific and intelligent, and provide technical support
and support for long-term social harmony and stability. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We must
deeply understand the role of the Internet in national management and social governance... It is
necessary to strengthen Internet thinking, make use of the advantages of flat, interactive and fast
Internet, promote scientific government decision-making, precise social governance, and efficient
public services, and use information technology to better perceive the social situation, smooth
communication channels, and assist decision-making and governance. ”1
Specialization of social governance refers to adapting to the needs of modernization, networking,
and informatization of social governance, and using modern governance methods to better innovate
social governance in accordance with professional standards. In modern society, the problems facing
human beings are becoming more and more complex and professional, and it is necessary to let
specialized talents solve professional problems through professional division of labor.
Specialization is an inevitable requirement for improving the level of social governance, and its
fundamental is to strengthen the construction of professional talents. Strive to build a professional
mass work team, a professional volunteer team, a professional social worker team, a professional
social psychological service team, and a professional emergency management team, and consolidate
the foundation of social governance. In addition, it is necessary to improve the ability to
comprehensively use professional work methods, and skillfully use mechanisms such as prediction
and early warning, risk prevention and control, incident response, education and reform,
psychological counseling, conflict mediation, interest coordination, policy guidance, standardized
law enforcement, and accountability

With the help of information means, Germany and France are simultaneously carried out to
achieve the goal of social governance.
