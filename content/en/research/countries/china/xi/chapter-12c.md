The concept of ecological civilization refers to the fundamental view of the relationship between
man and nature and how humans live with nature. The 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China took the harmonious coexistence of man and nature as one of the basic strategies for
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and emphasized
the need to firmly establish the concept of socialist ecological civilization and promote the formation
of a new pattern of harmonious development and modernization of man and nature. Conscientiously
understanding Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, deeply understanding and striving to
practice the Socialist Ecological Civilization Concept is of great significance to strengthening the
construction of ecological civilization, building a beautiful China, and promoting global ecological
governance.

1. "Adhere to the scientific view of nature of harmonious coexistence between man and nature"

The dialectical relationship between man and nature is the eternal theme of human development.
Building a harmonious relationship between man and nature and adhering to the scientific view of
nature of harmonious coexistence between man and nature are the core and foundation of the
socialist concept of ecological civilization.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Man and nature are the community of life. There is no substitute
for the ecological environment, and it is difficult to survive if it is not consciously used.”1 Man is
born of nature, and man and nature are a symbiotic relationship. The entire natural world, including
man, is a complete and organic ecosystem, with its own objective laws of movement, change and
development, and is not subject to human will. Human development activities must respect, conform
to and protect nature. History and reality have repeatedly proved that when human beings make
rational use and protect nature in a friendly manner, nature's rewards are often generous; when
human beings develop and plunder nature in a disorderly manner, nature's punishment must be
merciless. Only by following the laws of nature can human beings effectively prevent detours in the
development and utilization of nature, and avoid harming nature and ultimately harming human
beings themselves.

Adhering to the harmonious coexistence between man and nature means that the construction of
ecological civilization must give play to subjective initiative under the premise of following the laws
of nature, firmly follow the civilized development path of production development, rich life and
good ecology, and more consciously promote green development, circular development and low-
carbon development, and must not sacrifice the ecological environment in exchange for temporary
economic development; we must adhere to the principle of giving priority to conservation,
protection and natural restoration, and cannot only talk about taking without input, only talking
about development without protection, and only talking about utilization without repair. It is
necessary to protect the ecological environment like protecting the eyes, and treat the ecological
environment like life; we must do more good things to lay a foundation and benefit the long term,
do more practical things to protect nature and restore the ecology, and do more good things to control
mountains and water, show mountain dew, so that the masses can see the mountains, see the water,
remember homesickness, let the natural ecological beauty stay in the world forever, and nature is
peaceful, harmonious and beautiful.

2. the green development concept of "green water and green mountains are  gold and silver mountains"

Green waters and green mountains are gold and silver mountains, which is not only an important
development concept, but also a major principle that should be adhered to in promoting
modernization. As early as 2005, Comrade Xi Jinping, then Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial
Party Committee, put forward this important concept, which profoundly revealed the dialectical
relationship between the pursuit of harmony between man and nature, economy and society. Since
the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

He has emphasized and elaborated this concept many times, continuously expanded and deepened
its connotation from the theoretical and practical levels, and established a new strategic support for
the construction of ecological civilization. Nowadays, evergreen trees are cash cows, turning
ecological advantages into economic advantages, green water and green mountains can continuously
bring gold and silver mountains, protecting the ecological environment is to protect productivity,
improving the ecological environment is to develop productivity, these concepts have been more
and more practical verification and public opinion.

The important concept that green water and green mountains are golden mountains and silver
mountains shows that the protection of the ecological environment and the development of the
economy are fundamentally organic and mutually reinforcing. Economic development should not
be fishing for the exhaustion of resources and ecological environment, and ecological environmental
protection should not be abandoning the edge of economic development to seek fish, but should
adhere to protection in development, development in protection, achieve economic and social
development in harmony with population, resources and environment, and finally achieve the ideal
state of both gold and silver mountains and green waters. Green water and green mountains are the
important concepts of Jinshan Yinshan, and also clarify the important position of ecological
environment as an intrinsic attribute of productivity. Green water and green mountains and gold and
silver mountains are by no means opposites, the key lies in people, and the key lies in ideas. As
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "green ecology is the greatest wealth, the greatest advantage, and
the biggest brand",1 and green waters and mountains are not only natural wealth, ecological wealth,
but also social wealth and economic wealth. Protecting the ecological environment means protecting
natural value and increasing natural capital, protecting the potential and stamina of economic and
social development, and making green waters and mountains continue to exert ecological, economic
and social benefits.

Adhering to the concept that green water and green mountains are golden mountains and silver
mountains, we must implement the development concept of innovation, coordination, green,
openness and sharing, accelerate the formation of spatial pattern, industrial structure, production
mode and lifestyle that conserve resources and protect the environment, limit economic activities
and human behavior to the limits that natural resources and ecological environment can bear, leave
time and space for natural ecology to rest and recuperate, and realize the synergy of economic and
social development and ecological environmental protection. It is necessary to speed up the
delineation and strict observance of the three bottom lines of ecological protection, the bottom line
of environmental quality, and the upper limit of resource utilization, and absolutely must not be
done again for things that break through the three bottom lines, still use the extensive growth model,
and eat the rice of ancestors and smash the bowls of their descendants.

3. "a good ecological environment is the most inclusive people's livelihood and well-being" concept of livelihood

"A good ecological environment is the fairest public good and the most inclusive people's livelihood
and well-being",1 this scientific concept is a vivid embodiment of adhering to the people-centered
development thinking in the field of ecological civilization. People's hearts are politics, and people's
livelihood is related to people's hearts. The environment is people's livelihood, green mountains are
beauty, and blue sky is happiness. People-oriented, the most important of which is not to destroy
the environment of people's own existence in the process of development. If there is a serious
deviation in the relationship between population and resources and environment, it is impossible to
ensure that the people live and work in peace and contentment, let alone meet people's yearning for
a better life. Economic development is for people's livelihood, and protecting the ecological
environment is also for people's livelihood. Solving the ecological and environmental problems is
not only an economic issue, but also a major social issue related to the people's livelihood, and a
major political issue related to the mission and purpose of the Party.
To establish the concept of ecological people's livelihood, we must actively respond to the
requirements of the broad masses of the people to accelerate the improvement of the quality of the
ecological environment, adhere to the mutual promotion of the environment and people's livelihood,
and provide more high-quality ecological products for the people. Ecology for the people,
effectively improve the quality of the ecological environment, ensure the ecological rights and
interests of the people, and let the people truly feel the real environmental benefits brought by
economic development; we must protect the rural environment like the urban environment, attach
importance to the governance of the rural ecological environment, and absolutely must not appear
in the state of urban and rural "dual structure" in terms of ecological environment. Comrade Xi
Jinping has stressed many times that it is necessary to speed up the improvement of the quality of
the ecological environment, ensure the physical and mental health of the people, focus on solving
prominent environmental problems that harm the health of the people, safeguard the people's most
basic right to subsistence and development, and restore the natural beauty of the people's blue sky
and white clouds, twinkling stars, clear water and green banks, shallow bottom of fish, singing birds
and flowers, and idyllic scenery.

A good ecological environment is related to the vital interests of all the people, and building an
ecological civilization is a cause that the people participate in and enjoy together.

Everyone is a protector, builder and beneficiary of the ecological environment, and no one is a
bystander, outsider, critic, and no one can just say or do nothing. It is necessary to grasp the
orientation of the whole society to jointly build an ecological civilization, enhance the people's
awareness of conservation, environmental protection and ecological awareness, cultivate ecological
ethics and codes of conduct, carry out green actions for the whole people, mobilize the whole society
to reduce energy resource consumption and pollution emissions with practical actions, contribute to
ecological environmental protection, and form a social atmosphere that advocates ecological
civilization and protects the ecological environment. The grand goal of building a beautiful China
can only be smoothly realized at an early date if it is translated into the conscious action of all the
people.

4. the overall system view of "landscapes, forests, lakes and grasses are the community of life"

Ecology is a unified natural system, an interdependent and closely linked organic chain. The
lifeblood of man is in the field, the lifeblood of the field is in the water, the lifeblood of the water is
in the mountain, the lifeblood of the mountain is in the soil, and the lifeblood of the soil is in the
tree. Comrade Xi Jinping used the "lifeline" to connect people and the ecosystems of landscapes,
forests, lakes and grasses, and the elements of the ecosystems of landscapes, forests, lakes and
grasses, vividly and vividly expounded the integrated relationship between humans and nature,
coexistence and common prosperity, highlighting that ecology is a unified natural system and a
natural chain in which various natural elements are interdependent to achieve circulation. He
stressed: "Use control and ecological restoration must follow the laws of nature, if the planters only
plant trees, those who control water only manage water, and those who protect the field simply
protect the field, it is easy to lose sight of one and the other, and eventually cause systematic
ecological damage."1 This is not only a reflection and summary of the past governance methods, but
also an overall plan for the formation of a higher-level coordinated governance mechanism.
Incorporating all kinds of ecological resources into the framework of unified governance has
become an important methodology for promoting the construction of ecological civilization in the
current and future period.
The overall system view of "landscapes, forests, lakes and grasses are the community of life" reflects
the question of what kind of thinking and method to treat nature and what way to protect and restore
nature. Environmental governance and ecological construction are a systematic project, and we must
adhere to the systematic, comprehensive and comprehensive management of landscapes, forests,
lakes and grasslands. It is necessary to seek new ways of governance from the perspective of systems
engineering and the overall situation;

Mountains, water, forests, fields, lakes and grasses should be planned and comprehensively
managed as a whole and a system, leaving no "loopholes", no "open space" and no "dead ends.” In
accordance with the integrity and systematization of the ecosystem, it is necessary to
comprehensively consider all elements of the natural ecology, as well as the upper and lower
mountains, the ground and the underground, the land and the ocean, and the upstream and
downstream of the watershed, carry out systematic protection, macro management and control, and
comprehensive management, enhance the circulation capacity of the ecosystem, and strive to
maintain ecological balance. On the whole, we must change the situation of treating headaches, foot
pains, each managing each other, and hindering each other, adhere to overall planning, overall
measures, and multiple measures at the same time, and carry out the construction of ecological
civilization in an all-round, all-region, and whole-process manner.
To establish a holistic system view, we must follow the internal mechanism and laws of the
ecosystem. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "We must adhere to the priority of protection and natural
restoration, implement the ecological protection and restoration project of Lintian Lake in mountains
and rivers, increase the intensity of environmental governance, reform the basic system of
environmental governance, comprehensively improve the stability of natural ecosystems and
ecological service functions, and build a solid ecological security barrier." 1 Promote natural
restoration by reducing the negative effects of human activities, more conform to nature, and leave
space for nature to recuperate.
