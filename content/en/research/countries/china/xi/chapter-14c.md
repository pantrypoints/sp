3. consolidate the humanistic foundation for building a community with a shared future for mankind

Civilizations communicate through diversity, learn from each other through exchanges, and develop
through mutual learning. Comrade Xi Jinping vigorously advocates strengthening exchanges and
mutual learning among different countries, ethnic groups and cultures in the world, and
consolidating the humanistic foundation for jointly building a community with a shared future for
mankind. He clearly proposed to establish a civilizational concept of equality, mutual learning,
dialogue and inclusiveness, seek wisdom and nourishment from different civilizations, provide
spiritual support and spiritual comfort for people, and work together to solve various challenges
facing mankind. In May 2019, China successfully hosted the Conference on Dialogue of Asian
Civilizations, and in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony, Comrade Xi Jinping interpreted
the ideas of civilization self-confidence, mutual learning among civilizations and tolerance among
civilizations, setting the tone for dialogue among civilizations and mutual learning among
civilizations. This is China's practical action to promote dialogue and mutual learning among
civilizations, and has far-reaching exemplary significance for Asia and the world.
Uphold harmony without difference and safeguard the diversity of civilizations. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out that all achievements of civilization deserve respect and should be recognized and
cherished. All countries and nationalities should not only cherish and safeguard their own
civilization, especially their own ideology and culture, but also recognize and respect the ideology
and culture of other nationalities; on the one hand, they should enhance their own ideological and
cultural self-respect, self-confidence, and self-reliance. Especially in the era of globalization, while
paying attention to maintaining and highlighting their own characteristics and iconic symbols,
different civilizations are forming more and more common elements and symbols in the process of
exchanges and blending. There are no so-called "universal values" in the world that can be
transmitted or even imposed on other civilizations, and openness, inclusiveness, diversity and
mutual learning and diversity integration have become the main keynote of the great homeland of
human civilization in the 21st century. The pattern of one civilization being high above and others
following the marginalized is dissolving; The intention and practice of treating one's own
civilization as the sole central or powerful civilization and denigrating or even transforming other
civilizations will only seriously undermine the achievements of civilization and will eventually
endanger itself.

Adhere to equality and mutual respect, and strengthen dialogue and exchanges among civilizations.

Xi Jinping clearly pointed out:

"Every civilization is rooted in its own soil of survival, embodies the extraordinary wisdom and
spiritual pursuit of a country and a nation, and has its own value for existence. Human beings only
have the difference between skin color and language, and civilization only has the difference
between surname Ziyan and red, but there is absolutely no distinction between high and low. " 1
Civilizations should uphold an attitude of humility and mutual respect, avoid arrogance, prejudice
and one-sided narrow cognition, and oppose mutual isolation, mutual exclusion and mutual
substitution. If a civilization treats another civilization condescendingly, it will not only fail to
understand the mystery of this civilization, understand the true meaning of this civilization, and
cannot learn from the strengths and essence of this civilization, but will also be incompatible with
it. If you see that other civilizations are different from your own, you feel unpleasant, attack and
belittle them, and do everything possible to transform, assimilate, or even try to impose your own
civilization on others, which will only widen differences and even cause conflicts. Both history and
reality show that arrogance and prejudice are the biggest obstacles to exchanges and mutual learning
among civilizations, and equality and respect are the prerequisites for exchanges and mutual
learning among civilizations. Any attempt to resolve the differences between civilizations by
coercive means will not succeed, and the hegemony of civilizations and the "clash of civilizations"
can only bring disaster to world peace and human civilization.
Adhere to inclusiveness and mutual learning and promote the development and prosperity of
civilization. Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The diversity of human civilization gives this world
a red color, diversity brings exchanges, exchanges breed integration, and integration produces
progress." "Only by respecting each other, learning from each other, and coexisting harmoniously
in diversity can the world be rich and prosperous."2 "To learn alone and have no friends is to be
lonely and unheard." "Exchange and mutual learning are the essential requirements of the
development of civilization, and human history is originally a magnificent picture of mutual
exchanges, mutual learning and harmony among different civilizations. Of course, exchanges and
mutual learning among civilizations should be reciprocal and equal, pluralistic and multi-directional,
not coercive and coercive, and should not be single and unidirectional. Only through equal
exchanges and mutual learning can we seek common ground while reserving differences, learn from
each other's strengths, lead the excellent cultural genes of human civilization to adapt to
contemporary culture, harmonize with modern society, and lead the excellent cultural spirit to be
promoted. Only in this way can human civilization be full of vitality, continuous creative
transformation and innovative development, and all countries and peoples can find a way to achieve
common development, work together to cope with challenges, and jointly create a bright future of
a community with a shared future for mankind.
