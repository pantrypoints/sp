Chapter XV: Unswervingly Promoting Comprehensive and Strict Party Management

The key to adhering to and developing the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics lies
in the party, and the key lies in administering the party strictly in an all-round way. Since the 18th
National Congress of the CCP, the Party Central Committee with Comrade
Xi Jinping as the core has started from the beginning of style building, firmly grasped political
construction, which is the fundamental construction of the Party, and promoted the comprehensive
and strict management of the Party with firm determination, tenacious will and unprecedented
intensity, promoted the right style and discipline, and fought corruption and punishment, opening
up a new situation in the new great project of Party building. Adhering to the strict management of
the party in an all-round way is always on the road, having the courage to carry out self-revolution,
constantly enhancing the party's political leadership, ideological leadership, mass organization and
social appeal, and always maintaining the party's vigorous vitality and strong combat effectiveness,
which has become a clear symbol and goal requirement for promoting party building in the new era.
Section 1: Comprehensively and strictly administering the
party is always on the way
Strictly administering the party in an all-round way has been a distinct theme of party building since
the 18th CPC National Congress. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the Communist
Party of China is the core of leadership in our cause, and iron must be hardened by itself. In the new
era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, to accomplish the great cause, the party must have a
new atmosphere and new achievements, must lead the party in an all-round strict management to a
deeper depth with perseverance that will always be on the road, unswervingly uphold and improve
the party's leadership, and unswervingly build the party into a stronger and more powerful party.

1. The strategic choice of comprehensively administering the party strictly

The fact that the party should manage the party and administer the party strictly is a consistent
requirement and fundamental guideline for party building. The key to waging the great struggle with
many new historical characteristics, advancing the great cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation lies in constantly
advancing the new great project of party building. Compared with the development situation at home
and abroad, compared with the missions and tasks undertaken, there is still a considerable gap
between the party's leadership level and ruling level, the state of party organization building, and
the quality, ability, and work style of party members and cadres. In particular, for a period of time,
the problem of lax and soft management of the party in some localities and departments was very
prominent, and negative and corrupt phenomena were breeding and spreading. Some people ignore
the party's political discipline and political rules, and for the sake of their so-called career and
influence, some engage in cronyism and exclusion of dissidents, some engage in gangs and gangs,
some engage in anonymous false accusations and rumors, some engage in buying people's hearts
and minds and pulling votes, some engage in sealing official wishes and celebrating each other's
crowns, some engage in acting on their own and acting in a negative way, and some engage in
making big mistakes and making vain criticism of the central authorities. 1 Comrade Xi Jinping
clearly pointed out that "only when the party manages the party can it manage the party well, and
only by administering the party strictly can it cure the party well.”2

On October 8, 2014, Comrade Xi Jinping put forward for the first time the major proposition of
"comprehensively promoting strict party management" at the summary meeting of the party's mass
line education practice activities. In December 2014, during his investigation in Jiangsu, he further
pointed out that it is necessary to coordinate and promote the comprehensive construction of a
moderately prosperous society, comprehensively deepen reform, comprehensively govern the
country according to law, and comprehensively administer the party strictly, so as to promote reform,
opening up and socialist modernization to a new level. The Party Central Committee with Comrade
Xi Jinping as the core put forward the idea of "comprehensively administering the party strictly"
and incorporated the comprehensive strict management of the party into the "four comprehensive"
strategic layout. A new plan for managing the party and ruling the party in the new era was given.

Comrade Xi Jinping has always attached great importance to how to comprehensively and strictly
administer the party and made a series of important expositions. At the Second Plenary Session of
the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection,

Comrade Xi Jinping has profoundly grasped the important experience of comprehensively
administering the party strictly since the 18th National Congress of the CCP,
and summarized the adherence to the "six unifications", that is: adhere to the unity of ideological
party building and system party management, adhere to the unity of mission guidance and problem
orientation, adhere to the unity of grasping the "key minority" and managing the "overwhelming
majority", adhere to the unity of exercising power and assuming responsibility, adhere to the unity
of strict management and concern and trust, and adhere to the unity of supervision within the party
and the supervision of the masses. At the Third Plenary Session of the 19th Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, Comrade Xi Jinping summed up the scientific law of strictly managing the
party and ruling the party with the "five musts" from the practice of reform and opening up over the
past 40 years, that is: we must resolutely safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee and
centralized and unified leadership to ensure that the whole party is in step and acts in unison; We
must persist in administering the country before administering the party, and we must be strict in
administering the party to ensure that the party becomes the mainstay of the cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics; we must persist in taking the people as the center and ensure that the party
is built for the public and the government is for the people; We must adhere to the style of reform
and innovation and arduous struggle to ensure that the party always walks in the forefront of the
times; We must resolutely struggle against negative and corrupt phenomena and ensure that the
party always maintains its upright and honest political character. These understandings of laws and
new experiences are hard-won and precious, and need to be upheld and deepened for a long time to
become an important principle of party building in the new era.
The core of comprehensively administering the party strictly is to strengthen the party's leadership.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "In order to unite and lead the people to carry out great struggles,
advance great causes, and realize great dreams, the Party must unswervingly adhere to and improve
the Party's leadership and unswervingly build the Party into a stronger and more powerful party." 1
If the Party's leadership is weakened, or even abandoned, the Party's political status will be lost, the
nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics will change, and the great achievements made by
the Chinese people in their continuous struggle will be destroyed. To strengthen the party's
leadership, it is necessary to strictly manage the party and administer the party. Administering the
party strictly in an all-round way is an inevitable requirement for strengthening the party's leadership
and is also an inevitable choice for strengthening the party's leadership.
The foundation for comprehensively administering the party strictly lies in comprehensiveness.
Comrade Xi Jinping once pointed out that the so-called comprehensive means to manage the whole
party and the whole party, covering all fields, aspects and departments of party building. Obviously,
administering the party strictly in an all-round way requires that all aspects of party building be
strict, that the content has no dead ends, runs through the entire process, involves all subjects, all
aspects, and all departments, and relies on the whole party, manages the whole party, and governs
the whole party.

The focus of comprehensively administering the party strictly is to grasp the "key minority." "If a
person does not lead the way, he will not obey, and if he does not be first, he will not believe.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that "the key to strictly administering the party is to grasp the 'key
minority' of leading cadres and strictly manage leading cadres at all levels.”1 The Sixth Plenary
Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee stressed: "To strengthen party building, we must do a
good job in leading cadres, especially senior cadres, and the key is to do a good job in the
composition of the Central Committee, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee." Only by firmly grasping the
"key minority" and paying attention to giving play to their "head geese effect" can we achieve
remarkable results in comprehensively administering the party strictly.

The key to running the party strictly in an all-round way lies in strictness. The so-called strictness
means that the real management is really strict, the dare to manage the strict, and the long-term
management is strict. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that there is no "Danshu iron ticket" for impunity
in the party, and there is no "iron hat king", and "serious inner-party political life is the basis for
comprehensively and strictly administering the party." To manage the party, the party must first
manage its inner-party political life; to administer the party strictly, it must first start from the party's
inner-party political life.” 2 At the same time, it is necessary to grasp ideological strictness and
replenish the "calcium" of spirit; grasp discipline strictly, and put discipline in the forefront; grasp
the strict management of officials and adhere to the standards for good cadres in the new era; grasp
the strict work style and persist in the building of work style always on the road; grasp the anti-
corruption strictness and punish corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude; grasp the system of strict
management of the party, and regard the building of the party's internal laws and regulations system
with the party constitution as the fundamental observance as a major strategic task that has a bearing
on the party's long-term ruling power.

The key to administering the party strictly in an all-round way lies in administering the party. The
so-called governance means that from the party Central Committee to the provincial, municipal, and
county party committees, from the central ministries and commissions, the party leading groups
(party committees) of state organs and departments, to grass-roots party branches, they must
shoulder the main responsibility; party committee secretaries must regard doing a good job in party
building as a matter within their scope and must shoulder their duties; discipline inspection
commissions at all levels must shoulder the responsibility of supervision, dare to stare at black faces,
and dare to enforce discipline and accountability. In the past, we also talked about administering the
party strictly, but the biggest reason why it did not work well and achieved little results in many
places was that the main body of responsibility for managing the party and the party was not clear,
the accountability was ineffective, and the accountability was not strict. To administer the party
strictly in an all-round way means to be determined to solve this difficult problem, grasp the "bull's
nose" of the main responsibility of administering the party and the party, so that all the requirements
for administering the party and the party will become mandatory requirements, and the habit and
consciousness of administering the party strictly will be formed through long-term meritorious
service.
