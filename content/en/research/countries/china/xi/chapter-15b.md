2. Undergoing revolutionary forging in the course of comprehensively administering the party strictly

Comprehensively administering the party strictly is a prominent highlight of the party Central
Committee's governance with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core since the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China. After the implementation of this major strategy, the inner-party
political life has been renewed, the inner-party political ecology has noticeably improved, the party's
creativity, cohesion, and combat effectiveness have been significantly enhanced, the party's unity
and unity have been further consolidated, the relationship between the party and the masses has
improved significantly, and the party has become stronger in the revolutionary forging.

Comprehensively strengthen the party's leadership. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi
Jinping as the core clearly emphasizes that the Party, government, military, and civilian studies, the
Party is the leader of everything, and emphasizes that the Communist Party of China is the strong
leadership core and the highest political leading force for the cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Through strict political discipline and political rules of the Party and the
implementation of the political responsibility of administering the Party at all levels, the political
awareness, overall situation, core awareness, and awareness of alignment of the whole Party have
been continuously enhanced, the political consciousness of safeguarding the authority of the Party
Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership has been continuously enhanced, and the
loose and soft situation of managing the Party and the Party has been greatly changed.

Strengthen the ideals and convictions of the whole party. Revolutionary ideals are higher than
heaven. Adhering to the goals and pursuit of communists has always been the foundation for
communists to live and survive. Noble beliefs and firm convictions do not arise spontaneously.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "To refine the 'King Kong not bad body', we must arm our minds
with scientific theories and constantly cultivate our spiritual home."1 Since the 18th CPC National
Congress, the CPC Central Committee has demanded that cadres at all levels, especially senior
cadres, regard the systematic mastery of Marxist theory as their housekeeping skills, and that party
members should study the basic theory of Marxism in their original form, the latest achievements
of the Sinicization of Marxism, and base their ideals and convictions on rational identification with
scientific theories, on a correct understanding of historical laws, and on an accurate grasp of the
basic national conditions. Under the strong promotion of the Party Central Committee, the
theoretical study of the whole party, especially the study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, has been continuously advanced, and the belief in Marxism,
the belief in socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the realization of the Chinese dream of the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation have been further strengthened.

Focus on the building of the party's work style. The party's work style is the party's image, which
has a bearing on people's hearts and minds and on the party's survival. The party Central Committee
has firmly grasped the strengthening of the party's work style, put discipline in the forefront, started
with the formulation and implementation of the eight central regulations, and issued a mobilization
order to solve the problem of the party's work style. The party Central Committee has intensively
carried out the party's mass line education and practice activities, focusing on solving the "four
winds" problem, and achieved major results; it has carried out special education on "three strictness
and three realities", and carried out a concentrated "calcium supplement" and "refueling" for leading
cadres at and above the county and department level in terms of ideology, work style, and party
spirit; promoted the normalization and institutionalization of the "two studies and one doing" study
and education, and further solved the problems existing in the party member contingent in terms of
ideology, organization, work style, discipline, and so on. The education on the theme of "not
forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission" as the general requirement has
achieved the specific goals of making gains in theoretical study, being baptized ideologically and
politically, daring to take on responsibilities for entrepreneurship, serving the people and solving
problems, and setting an example of honesty and integrity.

Build a large contingent of high-quality cadres. The key to building socialism with Chinese
characteristics lies in building a large contingent of high-quality cadres and cultivating a contingent
of cadres with iron general belief, iron general belief, iron general discipline, and iron general
responsibility. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central
Committee has put forward the party's organizational line for the new era: fully implement Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, focus on the construction
of the organizational system, focus on cultivating high-quality cadres who are loyal, clean and
responsible, focus on gathering outstanding talents in all aspects who are patriotic and dedicated,
adhere to both ability and political integrity, put virtue first, and appoint people on merit, and provide
a strong organizational guarantee for upholding and strengthening the party's overall leadership,
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. In accordance with the standards
of good cadres in the new period of "firm conviction, serving the people, being diligent and
pragmatic, daring to take on responsibilities, and being honest and honest," efforts should be made
to train and select good cadres who are loyal, clean, and responsible for the needs of the party and
the people, and strive to crack down on "only votes", "only points", "only GDP", "only age", and
"only education.” We should resolutely investigate and deal with such behaviors as interceding and
greeting, asking for official posts, buying and selling official posts, and soliciting votes and bribing
votes, and earnestly solve the problems of weakening, weakening, and marginalizing grassroots
party organizations, and the situation and atmosphere of selecting and employing people have
noticeably improved, and the organizational foundation of the party's ruling power has been
continuously consolidated.

An overwhelming trend in the fight against corruption has been formed. Corruption is a social cancer
and the biggest threat facing the party. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central
Committee has cracked down on corruption, adhered to no forbidden areas, full coverage, and zero
tolerance, unswervingly "fought tigers," "flapped flies," and "hunted foxes," seriously investigated
and dealt with a number of corrupt and degenerate elements such as Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Guo
Boxiong, Xu Caihou, Sun Zhengcai, and Ling Jihua; and investigated and dealt with a series of
major cases, such as "systematic corruption" in Shanxi, election sabotage in Hengyang, Hunan
Province, vote solicitation and bribery in Nanchong, Sichuan, and vote solicitation and bribery in Liaoning, which have formed a strong deterrent effect on corruption. 

We should deepen the reform of the discipline inspection and supervision system, strengthen
supervision and restraint over power, focus on promoting the extension of strict party management
to the grassroots level in an all-round way, and initially realize the goal of not daring to be corrupt,
the cage that cannot be corrupted is getting stronger and stronger, the that does not want to be corrupt
is being built, and the anti-corruption struggle has won an overwhelming victory.

Use systems to manage the party and govern the party. Strengthening the building of inner-party
laws and regulations is a long-term and fundamental policy for comprehensively and strictly
administering the party. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the
Party Central Committee has adhered to the principle of governing the country according to law and
the system, governing the party according to regulations, and promoting overall planning and
integrated construction. The central authorities have promulgated or revised more than half of the
existing internal party regulations, and the system of internal party laws and regulations has been
continuously improved, initially forming an internal party laws and regulations system with the
party constitution as the foundation, democratic centralism as the core, and guidelines, regulations
and other internal party regulations as the main trunk.
3. Promote the development of strict party management in an all-round way
and in depth
Since the 18th CPC National Congress, historic achievements have been made in administering the
party strictly, but we must not be blindly optimistic. Reality warns us that there is still a heavy task
and a long way to go in comprehensively administering the party strictly, and we must not slacken
our efforts in administering the party for a moment. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in his report
to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "The whole party must soberly
realize that the ruling environment facing our party is complex, the factors affecting the advanced
nature of the party and weakening the purity of the party are also complex, and the outstanding
problems existing in the party such as impure ideology, impure organization, and impure work style
have not yet been fundamentally resolved." It is necessary to profoundly understand the long-term
nature and complexity of the tests facing the party in ruling, reform and opening up, market economy,
and external environment, and profoundly understand the sharpness and severity of the dangers of
spiritual slackness, lack of ability, separation from the masses, and passive corruption that the party
is facing, persist in being problem-oriented, maintain strategic concentration, and promote the
development of strict party management in an all-round way and in depth. ”1

The 19th CPC National Congress put forward the general requirements for party building in the new
era, that is: uphold and strengthen the party's comprehensive leadership, insist that the party should
manage the party and administer the party strictly in an all-round way, take strengthening the party's
long-term ruling capacity building, advanced and purity building as the main line, take the party's
political construction as the command, take firm ideals and convictions as the foundation, and
mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the whole party as the focus of efforts to
comprehensively promote the party's political, ideological, organizational, and work style building.
The building of discipline should run through the building of systems, promote the anti-corruption
struggle in depth, continuously improve the quality of party building, and build the party into a
Marxist ruling party that is always in the forefront of the times, wholeheartedly supported by the
people, brave in self-revolution, and able to withstand the tests of all kinds of storms. This general
requirement establishes the principles, principles, objectives, main line, overall layout, and strategic
arrangements for party building in the new era, and provides the basic guidelines for
comprehensively promoting party building in the new era and comprehensively administering the
party strictly in depth.

Upholding and strengthening the party's comprehensive leadership is the fundamental principle of
party building in the new era. We must understand the relationship between party building, the
party's overall leadership, and the strict management of the party from a political perspective. The
fundamental purpose of strengthening party building is to properly safeguard the party's leading
position and consolidate the party's ruling position and ruling foundation; while to uphold and
strengthen the party's comprehensive leadership, we must achieve the goal of strengthening party
building while promoting strict party management in an all-round way, so that the party can better
withstand the "four major tests" and "four dangers." Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that China's
affairs must be handled well, first of all, the affairs of the Communist Party of China must be handled
well. "If the party is not managed effectively and strictly... Then sooner or later our party will lose
its qualification to govern and will inevitably be eliminated by history.1 The common adherence to
party building, the party's overall leadership, and the strict management of the party in the new era
is to "build the party into a Marxist ruling party that is always in the forefront of the times,
wholeheartedly supported by the people, brave in self-revolution, and able to withstand the tests of
all kinds of storms.”2

The overall layout of party building in the new era aims to solve the major issue of "how to build
the party" in the new era, including political construction, ideological construction, organizational
construction, work style building, and discipline building, and to penetrate the system building and
promote the anti-corruption struggle in depth. The main line of party building is to strengthen the
party's long-term ruling capacity building and the building of its advanced nature and purity.
Strengthening the party's long-term ruling capacity emphasizes that the party should be prepared for
danger in times of peace and always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the risks faced by
the party's long-term ruling. keep

The advanced nature and purity of the party is the fundamental task and eternal task of the self-
building of a Marxist political party.

The foothold of party building in the new era is to continuously improve the quality of party building.
For the first time in the history of the Party, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China clearly put forward the proposition of "improving the quality of Party building", and it has a
clear sense of the times and problem-oriented. Party building in the new era is not only the
development of the scale of the party's organization, but also the improvement of the quality of party
building, including the quality of party members, grassroots organizations, and internal party laws
and regulations.

In order to implement the general requirements of party building in the new era, the party Central
Committee has made new arrangements for party building in the new era, emphasizing the need to
put the party's political construction in the first place, arm the whole party with Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, build a team of high-quality and
professional cadres, strengthen the building of grassroots organizations with a focus on improving
organizational strength, persist in upright conduct and discipline, win an overwhelming victory in
the anti-corruption struggle, improve the supervision system of the party and the state, enhance the
party's self-purification ability, and comprehensively enhance its ruling ability. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "To lead a large socialist country with more than 1.3 billion people, our party must not
only be strong in politics, but also have strong skills. "1 The whole party, especially leading cadres,
should earnestly enhance the eight skills, including the ability to study, political leadership, reform
and innovation, scientific development, ruling according to law, mass work, vigorously grasping
implementation, and controlling risks, and continuously improve their leadership ability and ruling
level. As long as the party builds itself well and strongly, and ensures that the party is always with
the people, it will certainly be able to lead the ship carrying the great dream of the Chinese people
to break the waves.
