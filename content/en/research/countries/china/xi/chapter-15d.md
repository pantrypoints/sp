3. Continuously improve the political ability of Party organizations and Party members and cadres at all levels

The strength of the party comes from the organization and from the vast number of party members
and cadres. The key to putting the party's political building in the first place and strengthening the
party's political building lies in improving the political ability of party organizations at all levels and
party-member cadres. On the basis of the 19th National Congress of the CCP
clearly requiring the whole party to strengthen its political leadership skills, Comrade Xi Jinping
also specially advised that senior party cadres should pay attention to improving their political
ability and match their political ability with their leadership responsibilities.

Constantly strengthening the political nature of party organizations at all levels is an important way
to improve the political ability of party organizations. Political attributes are the fundamental
attributes of party organizations, and political attributes must be highlighted from the party Central
Committee to local party committees, from grassroots party organizations at all levels to party
groups in various localities and departments, and from party discipline inspection commissions at
all levels to party work organs. All Party members should strengthen the Party's consciousness and
organizational concept, and all Party organizations and all Party members must firmly establish a
sense of playing chess, work in unison under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party
Central Committee, and form the overall joint force of the Party's organizational system.
Giving play to the political functions of state organs, mass organizations, and state-owned
enterprises and institutions is an inevitable requirement for enhancing the party's political ability.
First of all, state organs are essentially political organs, and it is their duty to speak clearly about
politics. State organs should always adhere to the implementation of economic and social
management activities in accordance with the law under the leadership of the party, and actively
and proactively implement the party's leadership propositions and major policy decisions and
arrangements.

It is necessary to improve the political position, set the political orientation, pay attention to political
results, consider political influence, resolutely prevent and correct erroneous understandings and
practices that separate and oppose politics and business, and ensure that politics and business are
integrated and highly unified. Second, mass organizations are political organizations under the
leadership of the Party, and they must actively play their political role. It is necessary to
conscientiously perform political duties, give full play to the role of the bridge and link linking the
masses of the people, increase the intensity of political mobilization, political guidance, and political
education, and better undertake the political task of guiding the masses to listen to and follow the
party. Deepen the implementation of the Party Central Committee's decision-making and
deployment on the reform of the masses, and earnestly enhance the political, advanced, and mass
nature of the masses. Third, strengthen the political orientation of state-owned enterprises and
institutions. State-owned enterprises and institutions are an important force to rely on for the party
to govern and rejuvenate the country, and they must always adhere to the party's leadership,
conscientiously implement the decisions and arrangements of the party central committee on
promoting the reform and development of state-owned enterprises and institutions, earnestly
strengthen the party building work of the units, give full play to the important role of party
organizations, and ensure that their units adhere to the correct political direction and achieve good
political results.

Improving the political skills of party members and cadres is the key to enhancing the party's
political ability. Party-member cadres are the backbone of the party's ruling and rejuvenating the
country, and they must earnestly improve their ability to grasp the direction, the overall trend, and
the overall situation, and their ability to distinguish between right and wrong in politics, maintain
political concentration, control the political situation, and prevent political risks through
strengthening political ability training and political practice experience. Efforts should be made to
enhance political awareness and political standing, take a clear-cut attitude in the face of major
issues of right and wrong, and always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central
Committee in terms of political stance, political direction, political principle, and political road. He
is good at studying and judging the situation and analyzing problems politically, consciously
thinking about problems and doing work under the overall situation of the work of the party and the
state, and doing everything to obey the overall situation and serve the overall situation. Enhance
awareness of danger and risk, take the initiative to shoulder the political responsibility of daring to
struggle, dare to shoulder, and dare to be responsible, consciously plunge into the tests of various
struggles, improve political skills in practical work and concrete actions, enhance political
sensitivity and political discernment, strengthen resolutely resist behaviors that violate political
discipline and endanger political security, be "fighters" who have the courage to struggle, and do
not be "gentlemen" who cherish feathers.
