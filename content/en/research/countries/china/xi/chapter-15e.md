Section 3: Courageous to self-revolution

The courage to self-revolution is the most distinctive character of the Communist Party of China and the greatest advantage of the Party.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The greatness of the Communist Party of China does not lie in
not making mistakes, but in never hiding from medical treatment, daring to face problems head-on,
daring to self-revolution, and having a strong ability to repair itself."1 The Party can lead the people
in a great social revolution and can also carry out a great self-revolution.

1. The courage to self-revolution is the most distinctive character of the Party

Upholding self-revolution is an inevitable requirement of the nature of a Marxist political party. In
order to maintain its advanced nature and purity and realize its lofty mission, a Marxist political
party must unswervingly solve its own problems and build and temper itself with the spirit of
courageous self-revolution. The fundamental mission and lofty ideal of a Marxist political party is
to realize communism. Realizing such lofty missions and ideals is the most majestic and magnificent
undertaking in the history of human society, as well as the most arduous and complex task. This
means the continuous transformation of the objective world and the subjective world, the continuous
change of productive forces and production relations, the economic base and superstructure, and the
continuous opening up of a new history and new era of human society, and its internal logical
premise is to carry out the most resolute and thorough revolution. This is why Lenin, in his
evaluation of Marxism, emphasized the profound truth that it is "critical and revolutionary in
nature." In the revolution carried out by the Marxist party, the self-revolution bears the brunt of the
revolution, and it is necessary to fight against all problems that weaken the advanced nature and
undermine the purity, so as to cure the disease and heal the wounds, and promote the turbidity. Marx
also said that the proletarian revolution differs from other revolutions in that it criticizes itself and
grows by criticizing itself.

Self-revolution has always run through the struggle of the Communist Party of China in the past
100 years. A history of the Party is a history of the Party's courage to revolutionize itself. In the
early days of the founding of the party, the resolute struggle against the "left" adventurous mistakes
existing in the party before the Long March, against the errors of "left" dogmatism during the Long
March, and against Zhang Guochuan's separatist behavior was a self-revolution; the resolute
struggle against subjectivism, sectarianism, and the eight strands of the party existing in the party
through rectification during the Yan'an period was a self-revolution; the struggle against corruption,
anti-waste, and waste carried out after the founding of New China was a self-revolution; Anti-
bureaucracy and the like are also self-revolution.

It is precisely in the continuous self-revolution that the Party has turned crises into security and
turned crises into opportunities, constantly growing from small to large and from weak to strong,
leading the Chinese people from victory to victory.
Reform is another self-revolution of the Party. This revolution has profoundly changed Chinese
society, the Chinese nation, and the Communist Party of China itself. From taking class struggle as
the keynote to taking economic construction as the center, from being closed and semi-closed to
opening up to the outside world in an all-round way, and from a planned economy to a socialist
market economy, the reform and opening up over the past 40 years and more have fully embodied
the party's self-revolution in the process of socialist construction of some ideologies, behavioral
habits, and institutional mechanisms that do not meet the requirements of modernization. It was
precisely such a profound self-revolution that the Party began the great journey of leading the
Chinese people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
has started by strictly managing the Party and ruling the Party, and has opened a knife to the stubborn
and stubborn diseases in the Party with the political courage of the blade inward, which has more
clearly embodied the Party's firm determination, strong will and consistent revolutionary spirit to
dare to self-revolution. It is precisely by relying on the courage of self-revolution and the spirit of
strong men breaking their wrists that the party has constantly cracked the curse of "historical cycle
rate" and achieved another "phoenix nirvana", has achieved a strong improvement in its own combat
effectiveness, realized the strong cohesion of the party's heart, the army's heart, and the people's
heart, constantly created a new situation in managing the party and the party, and successfully
opened up a new realm of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The courage of self-revolution is an important way for the CPC to adhere to the problem-oriented
approach to promote the development of the cause, demonstrating its fearless revolutionary courage.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that under the circumstances of profound changes in the conditions
of the world, the country, and the party, "whether there is a strong spirit of self-revolution, whether
there is a strong characteristic of self-purification, and whether it can persistently fight against its
own problems and mistakes has become a key factor determining the success or failure of the
party.”1 In order to rejuvenate and strengthen the party, we must build and temper ourselves with
the spirit of courageous self-revolution. On the one hand, the decisive victory in building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, the comprehensive construction of a modern
socialist country, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation have put forward
unprecedented new challenges and new requirements for the party. On the other hand, the "four
major tests" and "four dangers" have existed for a long time, and the party can only face the problems
head-on and eliminate all viruses that erode the healthy body of the party. Only by ensuring that the
Party has vigorous vitality and strong combat effectiveness can we provide a strong guarantee for
the development of the cause of the Party and the country.

2. the essence of courageous self-revolution

Revolution, in its original sense, is to reform the old and innovate, to keep the right and to bring out
the new, and its value direction is to improve, to the new, and to the good. Self-revolution means
that this revolution is the subject's conscious, spontaneous, and automatic behavior towards itself.
The self-revolution of the Communist Party of China is, in a nutshell, not forgetting its original
mission, keeping in mind its purpose of serving the people, insisting on proceeding from reality in
everything, and achieving self-purification, self-improvement, self-innovation and self-
improvement through self-vigilance, self-denial, self-reflection and self-transcendence.
The noble pursuit of upholding truth and correcting mistakes. History always follows a tortuous
path, smooth sailing is ideal, and zigzagging forward is the norm. The development of world history
shows that the greatness of a political party does not depend on riding lightly and striding forward
in good times, but on whether it can go against the trend in adversity, whether it can be reborn in
desperate situations, whether it can correct chaos after mistakes, and whether it can resolutely rise
up after setbacks. In the past hundred years, the Communist Party of China has had the glory of
triumphant performance, but also the trough of mistakes and setbacks, and even stood on the
precipice of life and death for a time. However, at critical junctures in history, the Party has always
been able to turn the tide and turn dangers into dangers because it dares to uphold the truth, correct
mistakes, and always maintain the courage to revolutionize itself and start all over again; it always
has a strong ability to correct mistakes and repair itself. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his
article "Serving the People": "Because we serve the people, if we have shortcomings, we are not
afraid of criticism and pointing them out.”1 "As long as we uphold the good for the interests of the
people and correct the wrong for the interests of the people, our team will surely prosper.2 The
Communist Party of China is open-minded and open-minded, and has always adopted a materialist
attitude towards the mistakes made by the Party in its understanding and practice. As Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out: "Our party has always maintained the spirit of self-revolution, maintained the
courage to admit and correct mistakes, picked up a scalpel again and again to eliminate its own
diseases, and solved its own problems again and again by itself."3

Inward, selfless and fearless political courage. Self-revolution means "revolutionizing" one's own
life and "using a knife" on one's own existing problems; it means introspecting oneself, denying
oneself, abandoning oneself, and surpassing oneself. However, the blade inward and self-revolution
is not a metaphysical view of negation, but a dialectical view of negation: that is, the purpose of
self-revolution is not to overthrow oneself and completely deny oneself, not to change course and
change the banner, but to ensure that the Party always becomes a strong leadership core for the great
cause and that the socialist system with Chinese characteristics is more mature and more stereotyped.
A mature and powerful Marxist political party has both the determination to uphold itself and the
courage to renew itself; the self-confidence to be beautiful and the consciousness to expose the
shortcomings and ugliness; and the courage to "change other people's lives" and the courage to
"change one's own life." The party's self-revolution is arduous work; it breaks the barriers of
interests, and it is more difficult to touch interests than to touch the soul; it is the malpractice of the
system that is eliminated and the cancer of corruption removed, so it is a very difficult revolution.
Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the party has fought many "tigers," slapped "flies," and
opposed the "four winds" for a long time, which has exceeded the expectations of the Chinese people
and surprised outsiders. Such a self-revolution could not have been achieved without the courage to
break the cauldron and sacrifice others, and without the courage to scrape bones to cure poison and
break the wrists of strong men.

The historical responsibility of all-round and whole-process change. All political parties that carry
out revolution have more or less taken some self-revolutionary actions, but the breadth and intensity
of self-revolution determine the realm that different political parties can achieve. The self-revolution
of the Communist Party of China is an all-round revolution and a revolution of the whole process,
and it has the characteristics of active planning, conscious initiation, and independent control,
including both revolution to itself and the cause it promotes, and is the unity of advancing the party's
cause and strengthening self-construction. It is precisely on the basis of a sober understanding of
"whether China's problems are going to occur or within the Communist Party" that the Party's
revolution for itself is not only a kind of soberness, a consciousness, and a kind of responsibility,
but also a practical action of managing the party and administering the party, and it is the unity of
knowledge and action. Such a revolution emphasizes self-supervision and self-repair, but does not
exclude external supervision such as mass supervision, social supervision, and public opinion
supervision; it is the result of the joint efforts of all quarters and the unity of self-discipline and other
disciplines. Such a revolution, covering all aspects and fields of party building, is to make ideology
and theory full of creativity, to make the organizational system more mobilizing, to make the style
and image more affinity, to make the institutional system more mature and formalized, and to make
the fight against corruption and clean government more symptomatic and cure. There is no end to
such revolutions; as far as specific stages and goals are concerned, the revolution has already
succeeded; in terms of a larger scope and a longer historical period, the revolution has not yet
succeeded, and comrades still need to make efforts.

Of course, self-revolution has different historical tasks in different historical stages, embodies
different phased characteristics, and is the unity of stages and processes."
Reform the old and innovate, keep the right and produce new practical actions. Social life is practical
and changing in nature, dialectics is critical and revolutionary in nature, and self-revolution
embodies the practical character and critical spirit of Marxism. The party's self-revolution is a will,
a spirit, a pursuit, and a courage, but in the final analysis it is an action, a practical action that breaks
through stereotypes and opens up and innovates. The Party has always had the courage to open up
a new situation in its undertakings with practical actions of self-renewal. During the revolutionary
years, the Party led the Chinese people to create a "revolutionary world miracle," and the
fundamental reason was that we did not follow the old path of the Western democratic revolution
and did not copy the path of the "October Revolution" in Russia, but embarked on a new democratic
revolutionary road of encircling the cities in the countryside and seizing political power by force;
during the construction era, the CPC led the Chinese people to create a "world miracle of
development." The fundamental thing lies in the fact that we have not simply continued the master
version of China's history and culture, simply applied the template envisaged by the classic writers
of Marxism, did not copy the model of socialist practice in other countries, did not copy the
experience of foreign modernization development, but embarked on a path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The successful opening up of the road of the new democratic revolution and
the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a true portrayal of the party's spirit of self-
revolution and a great achievement of the practice of self-revolution.
