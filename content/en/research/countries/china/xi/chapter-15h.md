3. Continuously strengthen the mass organizational strength

Mass organization is the ability to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and organize the masses
to promote social development. As a strong political party, it should have the organizational power
to "cheer up and respond.” The mass organizational power of the CCP is
universally recognized, but the mass organizational strength will not "preserve" or "increase value"
forever. To build the most powerful political party in the world, it is necessary to continuously
strengthen the mass organizational force, stimulate the great power contained in the masses, and
condense it into a majestic force to promote the development of the cause.

To strengthen the strength of mass organization, the premise is to bless the recognition and support
of the masses. A political party is a political organization that gathers together to realize certain
political ideals or political aspirations, and these political ideals or political aspirations must be
closely integrated with the interests of the masses and supported by the masses, otherwise nothing
will be achieved. The masses of the people are the true heroes, the creators of history, and the driving
force for the advancement of social development. The will of the people determines the rise or fall
of a political party. 

Mao Zedong said that communists are seeds and the common people
are the land. Without the fertile soil of the common people, no matter how good the seeds are, they
will not germinate, blossom, or bear fruit. The key to the continuous development and growth of the
CCP in the past 100 years lies in closely integrating its political ideals,
political aspirations and the interests of the people, and is committed to seeking happiness for the
Chinese people, rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and human progress. To build the most powerful
political party in the world, we must put the people in the central position and take the interests of
the people as the starting point and foothold of all policies, and only in this way can we win the
heartfelt love and support of the broad masses.

To enhance the strength of mass organization, it is important to strengthen the consciousness and
feelings of serving the people. Only with one heart and one mind can we walk in the same direction.
Enhancing the awareness of the whole party, especially the leading cadres at all levels, of serving
the people is the basic prerequisite and key to enhancing the strength of mass organizations. In
response to a Russian reporter's question about "what is the governing philosophy", Comrade Xi
Jinping replied succinctly and brightly, serving the people and shouldering his due responsibility.
When Comrade Xi Jinping visited the local area, some people praised him in simple words for
"doing a good job", and Comrade Xi Jinping said with a smile, I am the people's orderly. These
dialogues are simple and plain, but they show the people's feelings of contemporary Chinese
communists. The broad masses of party members and cadres consciously adhere to the party's mass
line, adhere to the party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses, mingle with the
people, want to work together, and lead the masses to work and show the masses, and the masses of
the people will spontaneously rise up and work together with the party.
To enhance the organizational strength of the masses, it is also necessary to learn and master the
law of organizing the masses. Only by combining the characteristics of the new era and the
characteristics and practice of the masses in the new era, thoroughly studying and mastering the law
of organizing the masses, thinking about problems and doing things in accordance with the
characteristics of the law of organizing the masses, can we carry out work effectively and achieve
the predetermined goal. It is necessary to persist in asking the needs of the people, asking the
people's plans, and benefiting the people, go deep into the masses to investigate and study,
understand what the people think and think, humbly ask the masses for advice, be good students of
the masses, draw wisdom and nourishment from the practice of the masses, and seek policies,
measures, and methods for organizing the masses from the creation of the masses.

4. Continuously enhance social appeal

The social appeal of a political party, especially the ruling party, refers to its ability to mobilize for
different groups, strata and forces in society, which is reflected in many aspects such as cohesion,
mobilization and guidance. The party already has a strong social appeal, and in the face of the new
conditions and new requirements of the new era, it is necessary to continuously enhance the social
appeal in order to build the party into the most powerful party in the world.
The social appeal comes from the party itself, especially the quality of grassroots party organizations
and party members and cadres. The ancients said, "The ruler is righteous", "his body is right, but he
does not order; his body is not right, although he does not obey the order.” As long as grassroots
party organizations are built into strong fighting fortresses, and as long as party members and cadres
can take the lead in setting an example, the party's calling role will naturally increase. Therefore, it
is necessary to vigorously practice internal strength, strengthen the building of the party's grass-
roots organizations, implement the main responsibility, give play to the political and service
functions of grass-roots party organizations, and enable the broad masses of grass-roots party
organizations to truly become a strong position for serving the people; properly handle the
relationship between the size of party members and the quality of party members, put the quality of
party members in a prominent position, and promote party members to truly play a vanguard and
exemplary role; give play to the role of leading cadres as "locomotives," prevent the phenomenon
of bad money driving out good money in accordance with the standards of good cadres, and promote
the formation of capable people and mediocre people down. The employment orientation of the
survival of the inferior has formed a good situation of clean air, outstanding talents, and abundant
talents.

To enhance social appeal, we should pay attention to carrying forward the party's fine traditions,
persist in inspiring people with lofty goals, and inspire people with the pursuit of a better life. Carry
out extensive and in-depth education on the situation and policies, fully demonstrate the progress
results and development trend of reform, opening up and socialist modernization, and persist in
using the "two centenary goals" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation to inspire people's enthusiasm for entrepreneurship. Marxism believes that the pursuit of
interests is the fundamental reason for all human social activities and the deep driving force for the
forward development of human society. To enhance social appeal, we must also safeguard the
fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people. It is necessary to actively improve the
mechanism for expressing the demands of the masses, the balance mechanism and the adjustment
mechanism, and accurately and timely respond to the demands of the masses by improving social
integration, so that the masses can improve their social appeal while feeling fairness and justice.
With the development and popularization of Internet technology, the Internet has become the
"biggest variable" affecting the relationship between the party and the masses and the foundation of
governance. It is necessary to pay attention to taking the mass line on the Internet, and actively build
an information platform that reflects public opinion, gathers people's wisdom, and gathers consensus;

Actively respond to the concerns of netizens, resolve doubts and confusions, and make the Internet
a strong position to unite, inspire and lead people to struggle together.
"Decorating this Guanshan is even better today." "Compared with the past, this is the best era for
China and the best era for Chinese people. Shouldering the great trust of the people and the nation,
the CCP, the world's largest party, will also build itself into "the most powerful
political party in the world." Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the CPC is adhering to its original mission and full of pride and
confidence, and is striding forward on the road of rejuvenating the party and strengthening the party.
