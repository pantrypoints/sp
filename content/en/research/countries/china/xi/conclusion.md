Today's world is undergoing drastic and profound changes, and contemporary China is engaged in
a great struggle with many new historical characteristics. Walking on the magnificent journey of the
new era, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has ushered in unprecedented bright prospects,
but also faced unprecedented risks and tests. To fulfill the historical mission entrusted by the new
era, Chinese communists must unswervingly adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and enrich and develop this idea in practice with the times.

1. Deeply grasp the great significance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding ideology of the Party and the state

"The true content of all epoch-making systems is the needs of the times that produced them. Each
such system is based on the entire development of the country's past, on the historical form of class
relations and its political, moral, philosophical and other results.”1 Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the inheritance and development of Marxism-
Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thinking of "three
represents" and the scientific outlook on development. This thinking closely focuses on the new
situation, new problems and new challenges faced by socialism with Chinese characteristics since
the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

From the combination of theory and practice, it creatively answers the major questions of the times
of what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to uphold and develop in the new era and
how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is of great political,
historical, theoretical, practical and world significance. In contemporary China, adhering to and
developing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is to truly
adhere to and develop Marxism and scientific socialism.
The great political significance of this ideology lies in the fact that it provides an irreplaceable and
indispensable ideological guarantee and theoretical foundation for the formation, establishment and
consolidation of the core position of Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee
and the whole Party.

Marxism has always held that revolutionary leaders play a particularly important role in the
development of history, which is consistent with respecting the initiative of the masses. As early as
1873, Engels profoundly revealed in "On Authority" the extreme importance of the authority of the
party leader to the proletarian party. Lenin also pointed out that a fighting revolutionary party needs
strong and authoritative leadership. The core of the Party should be composed of cultivated, capable,
experienced and tested professional revolutionaries. However, the core of leadership of a Marxist
political party has never been self-appointed or born, but has been formed and established in the test
of practice, especially in the difficult test at a major historical turning point. Such a core of leadership
must not only have the profound insight and strategic foresight of Marxist politicians, but also have
the extraordinary theoretical attainments and profound cultural heritage of Marxist theorists. It is
necessary not only to have the strong historical responsibility and fearless dedication of professional
revolutionaries, but also to have the rich practical experience and outstanding leadership skills of
strategic doers; it is necessary to prove practical leadership with the achievements of governing the
country, and to demonstrate ideological leadership with scientific theories. It is necessary not only
to let the masses of the people resolutely follow in action, but also to make the masses of the people
consciously align themselves ideologically.
Judging from historical practice, the formation and establishment of the leader of a Marxist political
party and the advancement of the party's guiding ideology with the times are interrelated, mutually
dependent, interactive, and mutually complementary. Leaders create ideas, ideologically arm
political parties, political parties guide the people, the people plunge into practice, and practice
creates leaders; this is the basic law and internal logic of the development of Marxism and scientific
socialism over the past 170 years. The more the theory created by the leader of a Marxist political
party meets the needs of the times, the broader and more profound it is, the more it occupies the
commanding height of ideology, the more pragmatic and effective it is, the more supreme theoretical
authority it has, and the more solid and irreplaceable his leadership status and political authority will
be.

In the history of the Communist Party of China, in the course of leading the Chinese revolution,
Comrade Mao Zedong wrote one magnificent work after another on the Sinicization of Marxism,
founded Mao Zedong Thought, which was recognized by the whole party and integrated Marxism
with China's reality, and established the position of Marxist theoretician and theoretical authority in
the central leadership and the whole party, and this theoretical authority in turn guaranteed Comrade
Mao Zedong's position as the core of leadership in the whole party with its practical guidance. In
the process of leading the people to promote reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
successfully created socialism with Chinese characteristics, formed Deng Xiaoping Theory, and
established its core position in the central leading collective. He clearly pointed out: "Any leadership
collective must have a core, and leadership without a core is unreliable."1
Comrade Xi Jinping is the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party
formed in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the establishment of this status
comes from the historic achievements and historic changes that he has made since the 18th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, and also from the strong creativity, cohesion, combat
effectiveness and leading force of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era, which was mainly founded by him. The 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China named the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era after
Comrade Xi Jinping and wrote it into the Party Constitution as a guiding ideology that the whole
Party must adhere to for a long time, and the constitutional amendment adopted by the First Session
of the 13th National People's Congress enshrined this idea in the Constitution and became the
guiding ideology that the whole Party and the whole country must adhere to for a long time. This is
a conscious adherence to and scientific adherence to the Marxist concept of authority and leadership,
the highest recognition of Comrade Xi Jinping's ideological authority as the democratic backbone
of the whole party and all ethnic groups in the country, and the most important political achievement
and far-reaching historical contribution of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China.
The great historical significance of this idea lies in the fact that its formation, development and
extensive practice have made China the theoretical source, practical innovation and development
guide of scientific socialism in the 21st century, and the mainstay of revitalizing world socialism.
World socialism has gone through a historical process from utopia to science, from theory to practice,
from practice in one country to development in many countries, from suffering serious setbacks to
gradually coming out of the low tide and moving towards revitalization, and socialism with Chinese
characteristics has become an important part of its unique practical exploration.

In the new era, Comrade Xi Jinping focused on the new great practice of socialism with Chinese
characteristics to carry out unremitting theoretical exploration, and formed Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Under the guidance of this thinking, the road
of socialism with Chinese characteristics has become broader and broader, not only promoting
China's all-round pioneering historical achievements in various undertakings and taking place
profound and fundamental historical changes, but also using ironclad facts to forcefully counter the
conspiracies and attempts to subvert socialism such as the "end of history", so that scientific
socialism in China in the 21st century will radiate unprecedented strong vitality and hold high the
great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the world.
Looking back at history, scientific socialism has revealed the law of the development of human
society. It has pointed out the way for mankind to leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom
of freedom, pointed out the path for the working class and working people to achieve freedom and
liberation, guided the independent liberation movement of a large number of nation-states such as
China, and profoundly changed the development process of human society and the pattern of the
entire world. Looking at the present, under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the most
promising and important component of world socialism in the 21st century, composing a brilliant
chapter in the past 500 years of socialism, bringing about new and profound changes in the balance
of forces between capitalism and socialism in the world, and reshaping the political and economic
map of the world. It has created a new glory in the history of world socialism, greatly boosted the
confidence of the people of the world in socialism, and brought bright prospects for the development
of world socialism and the progress of human society. Looking forward to the future, Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era will surely lead China to carry
on the past and forge ahead into the decisive achievements of building a modern socialist power in
an all-round way, and more eloquently prove the truth of scientific socialism and the strong
advantages of the socialist system.
The great theoretical significance of this thinking lies in the fact that it is the result of another
historical leap in integrating Marxism with China's reality, and is another dazzling peak of
contemporary Chinese Marxism and Marxism in the 21st century.
Social history is eternally developed, and theoretical innovation in grasping the law of social
development is also endless. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era not only adheres to the basic principles of Marxism, but also adheres to emancipating the
mind, seeking truth from facts, and advancing with the times, which is a model of innovative
development of Marxism, contemporary Chinese Marxism, and Marxism in the 21st century.

This ideology has integrated the unremitting pursuit of the Communist Party of China for more than
90 years, the arduous struggle of New China for more than 70 years, and the pioneering and
innovative work of reform and opening up for more than 40 years with more than 170 years of
arduous exploration in modern times and the development of civilization of the Chinese nation for
more than 5,000 years. Mao Zedong Thought and the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese
characteristics are connected, and a series of new concepts, ideas and strategies have been creatively
put forward around the theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics,
fully demonstrating its broad and profound ideological background and theoretical logic.
This thinking focuses on the application of Marxist theory, on new practice and new developments,
and has said many "new words" that no one has said before, thus making a major original
contribution to the enrichment and development of Marxism. These original contributions are rich
in content and systematically run through the three major components of Marxist philosophy,
political economy and scientific socialism, covering all aspects and fields of the cause of the party
and the state. In terms of philosophy, this ideology adheres to the world outlook methodology of
dialectical materialism and historical materialism, adheres to the fundamental position of taking the
people as the center, creatively uses the viewpoint of practice, contradiction, the masses, and all-
round development, and establishes strategic thinking, historical thinking, dialectical thinking,
innovative thinking, legal thinking, and bottom-line thinking, giving Marxist philosophy a new
connotation of the times; In terms of political economy, this idea delves into the trend of world
economic development and the new situations and new problems facing our economy, and answers
the questions that Marxist classic writers have not talked about, and our predecessors have never
encountered. Many major theoretical and practical problems that Western economic theories have
been unable to solve, made a major judgment that China's economic development has entered a new
normal, put forward a new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and
sharing, established major strategic deployments such as deepening supply-side structural reform
and building a modern economic system, and written a new chapter in Marxist political economy.
In terms of the theory of scientific socialism, we have deepened our understanding of the path,
theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and enriched and developed
the essence, value stance, development stage, development momentum, construction layout,
strategic arrangement and goal of socialism with Chinese characteristics with the times. It has
greatly expanded the theoretical connotation of scientific socialism. These major theoretical
innovations have pushed forward Marxism as a whole, in all aspects, and in all fields, and opened
up a new realm for the development of Marxism. In today's China, only Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and no other thought can solve China's
practical problems.

The fundamental practical significance of this idea lies in the fact that it has brought socialism with
Chinese characteristics into a new era and provided theoretical guidance and action guidelines for
building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way and realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is rooted in the Chinese
land, reflects the will of the people, adapts to the characteristics of the new era and the requirements
of China's development and progress, is a theoretical summary and theoretical sublimation of the
great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, and is a powerful ideological weapon of Marxism that comes from
practice, has been tested by practice and guides practice. This ideology adheres to the unity of goal-
oriented and problem-oriented, deeply examines the problems encountered in the current and long-
term, partial and overall, theory and practice, puts forward strategic ideas and measures, and
provides scientific guidance for coping with major challenges, resisting major risks, overcoming
major resistances and resolving major contradictions.
In terms of overall orientation, this thinking profoundly answers a series of fundamental questions
such as what banner the Communist Party of China should raise, what road to take, what mental
state it should take, what historical mission it should undertake, and what goal of struggle it would
achieve, and once again declare to the world that China will neither follow the old road of closure
and rigidity, nor take the evil road of changing the banner, but will unswervingly take the clear
position of unswervingly following the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and point out
the way forward for China in the new era. In terms of strategic deployment, these three ideas connect
the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, put forward the overall
layout of the "five-in-one" and the coordinated promotion of the "four comprehensive" strategic
layout, and carry out top-level design and systematic planning in important aspects such as reform,
development, stability, internal and foreign affairs, national defense, and party and military
management, thus providing a strategic guiding bow for the realization of the "two centenary goals."
In terms of practical requirements, this ideology emphasizes that all comrades in the party must take
a long-term view, be prepared for danger in times of peace, be bold in making changes and
innovations, never become rigid and never stagnate, always breathe with the people, share a
common destiny, and link hearts with hearts, and continue to forge ahead toward the grand goal
with an unslackening mental state and an indomitable stance of struggle.
The fundamental significance of this idea in the world lies in the fact that it provides a brand-new
path choice for countries and nations in the world that wish to accelerate development while
maintaining their independence, and contributes Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to solving
human problems.
Great ideas are never narrowly closed, but run through the world's vision, world consciousness, and
world feelings.

Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is based on China,
taking the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as its sacred
mission and main purpose; at the same time, facing the world, it is his unshirkable responsibility
and responsibility to strive for the cause of human progress and make new and greater contributions
to mankind.
In today's world, challenges such as governance deficit, trust deficit, peace deficit and development
deficit are emerging one after another, problems such as the gap between the rich and the poor,
terrorism, climate change and other problems are emerging one after another, the international
political and economic system dominated by Western capitalist developed countries is full of
drawbacks, and the global governance system is undergoing profound changes. In the face of the
complex and changeable international situation, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era, with a broad vision and strategic thinking, clearly puts forward a
series of new concepts, ideas and propositions on the future and destiny of mankind, providing new
directions, new plans and new choices for the development of human society.
This idea clearly puts forward the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind,
advocates and promotes the "Belt and Road", advocates the use of economic methods and the bond
of interests to closely aggregate countries along the route, and realizes policy communication,
facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds,
contributing Chinese wisdom to promoting global governance and further enhancing the political
leading role of the Communist Party of China in solving major human problems. This idea has
broken the situation that the Western modernization model has been "fixed on one statue" since
modern times, opened up a new way for developing countries to achieve modernization, provided
Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for mankind's exploration of a better social system, and
greatly encouraged the confidence of developing countries to explore a development path that suits
their national conditions, especially for those developing countries that blindly adopt the Western
political system and fall into the quagmire. The Chinese path advocated by this ideology is not only
a path of political development and social development, but also a path of civilization development,
which brings an ancient civilization that has lasted for thousands of years without interruption to the
center of the world stage with a new attitude, manifests the light of Chinese civilization, further
enriches the diversity of human civilization, and demonstrates the ideological power of making
civilizational exchanges transcend civilizational barriers, mutual learning between civilizations
transcend civilizational conflicts, and civilizational coexistence surpass civilizational superiority.
Under the guidance of this thinking, the Communist Party of China, as a great political party, China
as a great country and the Chinese nation as a great nation, while planning and realizing its own
development and progress, will also have a comprehensive and profound impact on the world and
forcefully promote the noble cause of mankind's pursuit of peace and development.

2. Strive to master the Marxist standpoints and viewpoints
that run through it
To learn and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era, we must not only seriously understand its rich connotation, ideological system and practical
requirements, but also further deeply understand and master the Marxist positions and views and
methods that run through it, so as to know what is true and why it is. Only in this way can we
continuously improve our ability to use dialectical materialism and historical materialism to observe
and analyze problems, and continuously improve our ability to use Marxist ideological methods and
working methods to understand and transform the world.
First, adhere to the fundamental position of people-centeredness. The people's stand is the
fundamental political stand of Marxism. Always standing on the people's standpoint, not departing
from this position, and not wavering is a major issue in mastering the Marxist world outlook, and it
is also a major issue to be solved in studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. As contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century
Marxism, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, on the basis
of adhering to the fundamental position of Marxism, explains the value purpose of "people-
centered", which is the inheritance and development of Marxist value pursuit, and a clear expression
of the Chinese communists' never forget their original intention and remember their mission.
In terms of values, this idea puts the "people" in the highest position in governing the country, and
is epitomized as putting the people first, for the people, relying on the people, and judging by the
people. In terms of strategic layout, this idea has always adhered to the standpoint of the people and
carried out strategic planning: to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, "the
people's living standards and quality of life will be generally improved" as one of the basic goals;
The starting point and foothold of comprehensively deepening reform is to promote social fairness
and justice and improve the well-being of the people; Comprehensively governing the country
according to law emphasizes the need to let the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case;
comprehensively administering the party strictly, focusing on solving the virus that erodes the
healthy body of the party and the prominent problems that the people strongly resent, and further
consolidating and deepening the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people. On the path
of implementation, this idea firmly grasps the people's yearning for a better life, and implements the
people-centered development thinking in the entire process and all aspects of socialist
modernization: economic construction pays more attention to improving the people's material living
standards, political construction pays more attention to ensuring that the people are masters of the
country with a sound system and system, and cultural construction pays more attention to satisfying
the people's multifaceted and multifaceted needs. Multi-level spiritual and cultural needs, social
construction pays more attention to ensuring and improving people's livelihood, and ecological
civilization construction pays more attention to meeting people's needs for a beautiful ecological
environment.

Second, adhere to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts. Seeking truth from facts is the
fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, the fundamental requirement for Chinese communists to
understand and transform the world, and the basic ideological method, work method, and leadership
method of our party. The ideological line of seeking truth from facts embodies the world outlook
and methodology of Marxist philosophy, and its theoretical basis is the "principle of the unity of the
world's material" and "the principle of dialectical unity of human understanding and practice."
"Facts" are all things that exist objectively, "is" is the internal relationship of objective things, that
is, objective laws, and "seeking" means exploring and studying. Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly
expounded the great significance of adhering to seeking truth from facts, profoundly expounded the
relationship between seeking truth from facts as the fundamental ideological method of our party
and Marxist philosophy, and emphasized that "we must consciously strengthen the belief in seeking
truth from facts, enhance the ability to seek truth from facts, and always and everywhere keep
seeking truth from facts in mind and put it into practice.”1
The basis for persisting in seeking truth from facts lies in understanding "facts," that is,
understanding reality and grasping the facts. In the face of the complex and ever-changing domestic
and international situations and new problems that are emerging one after another, the most
fundamental requirement for persisting in seeking truth from facts is to persist in proceeding from
reality in everything. The biggest national condition and reality of contemporary China is that China
is still in the primary stage of socialism, which is the objective basis for us to understand the present,
plan for the future, formulate policies, and promote the cause, and is the general basis for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "When we think about
problems, make decisions, and do things, we must not forget or ignore the basic national conditions
and basic characteristics of the primary stage of socialism in our country."2 "Under all circumstances,
we must firmly grasp this maximum national condition, and promote reform and development in all
aspects must be firmly based on this greatest reality." We must always keep in mind the primary
stage not only in economic construction, but also in political, cultural, social and ecological
civilization construction; not only when the economic aggregate is low, but also after the economic
aggregate is improved, we must still keep in mind the primary stage;

Not only should we base ourselves on the initial stage when planning for long-term development,
but we must also keep the initial stage in mind in our daily work.1 At the same time, objective reality
is not static, but constantly evolving. Proceeding from reality, we must also accurately grasp the
phased characteristics of China's economic and social development, accurately grasp the new
changes and new characteristics of different stages of development, and make the subjective world
better conform to the objective reality of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
The key to persisting in seeking truth from facts lies in "seeking truth", that is, exploring and
mastering the law of the development of things. Law is the intrinsic, essential, and inevitable
connection of things themselves, and it is the inevitable trend of development. Respecting the law,
following the law, and constantly deepening the understanding and grasp of the law are a major
feature of the governance of the country by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping
as the core. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era itself is
the result of scientifically grasping objective laws, and it is "sought" by exploring the "facts" of
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. This ideology upholds the organic unity of
governing the country with party building and deepens the understanding of the law governing the
Communist Party; upholds the basic principles of scientific socialism with the reality of China and
the characteristics of the times and deepens the understanding of the law governing socialist
construction; upholds the organic unity of China's development and the development of human
society, and deepens the understanding of the law governing the development of human society. Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era epitomizes our party's
new understanding of the "three laws", provides a fundamental basis for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and is the action guide for the whole party
and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation.
Third, adhere to materialist dialectics. Materialist dialectics reveals the characteristics of the
universal connection and eternal development of the material world, requires people to fully use
dialectical methods to observe and deal with problems in the process of understanding the world
and transforming the world, and is the basic method for us to observe the world, judge the situation,
and understand problems. The essence and core of materialist dialectics is the law of unity of
opposites, that is, to recognize contradictions, analyze contradictions, resolve contradictions, grasp
unity in opposition, grasp opposition in unity, so as to achieve the purpose of analyzing and solving
problems.
Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "Learn to master the fundamental method of materialist dialectics,
continuously enhance the ability of dialectical thinking, and improve the ability to control complex
situations and deal with complex problems."

"The deeper our career goes, the more we must continue to strengthen our ability to think critically.1
He grasped the most fundamental principle of materialist dialectics, the law of unity of opposites,
paid attention to applying dialectical thinking to strategic planning, and persisted in observing things
in a developmental rather than static, comprehensive rather than one-sided, systematic rather than
piecemeal, and universally linked rather than single and isolated manner; properly handled the
relationship between the local and the overall situation, the present and the long-term, and the key
and non-key points, paid attention to grasping the critical issues related to the overall situation, long-
term development, and the people's well-being, and pursued advantages and avoided disadvantages
in weighing the pros and cons. Make the most advantageous strategic choices. In practical
application, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era not only
emphasizes two points but also focuses on key points; it not only pays attention to overall planning,
"playing the piano with ten fingers", but also is good at highlighting key points, grasping key points,
leading areas with points, and driving overall advancement and overall work with key breakthroughs,
providing us with effective methods and "keys" for understanding problems, analyzing problems
and solving problems.
Methodology is the theoretical basis of the way of thinking, and the way of thinking is the specific
application of methodology. Comrade Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the mastery and
application of Marxist methodology, creatively combines Marxist methodology with traditional
Chinese cultural wisdom and modern scientific thinking methods, and clarifies the basic
connotations and principles of strategic thinking, historical thinking, dialectical thinking, innovative
thinking, rule of law thinking, bottom-line thinking and other ways of thinking in the new era.
Strategic thinking is a way of thinking that is far-sighted, takes charge of the overall situation, and
is good at grasping the overall trend and direction of the development of things; historical thinking
is a way of thinking that knows the past and learns from the present, and is good at using historical
vision to understand the law of development, grasp the direction of progress, and guide practical
work; dialectical thinking is to be good at grasping the key and pinpointing the key points, grasping
the law of development of things in the process of the unity of opposites between the two sides of
the contradiction, and preventing extreme and one-sided thinking methods; innovative thinking
means breaking superstitions, transcending stereotypes, and being good at adapting measures to the
times and conditions. Thinking about the rule of law is a way of thinking that enhances the awareness
of respecting the law and abiding by the law and being good at using the rule of law to govern the
country; bottom-line thinking is a way of thinking that objectively sets the lowest goal, bases itself
on the lowest point, and strives for the greatest expectations. In the practice of building a modern
and powerful socialist country in an all-round way,

Comrade Xi Jinping unified these scientific ways of thinking, emphasized strategic thinking to lay
out the overall situation, historical thinking to view the general trend, dialectical thinking to grasp
the fundamentals, innovative thinking to increase vitality, rule of law thinking to seek good
governance, bottom-line thinking to make up for shortcomings, formed a new era of scientific
thinking methodology, endowed the materialist dialectic ideological methods and working methods
with new era connotation and practical value, and creatively elevated the application of Marxist
methodology to a new realm.
Fourth, adhere to the practical concept of integrating understanding the world and transforming the
world. The practical perspective is the primary basic viewpoint of Marxist philosophy, and it is also
the basic theoretical character of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for
a New Era. Marxist philosophy is not only committed to explaining the world, but also to
transforming it. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era was
founded to change the historical destiny of the contemporary Chinese people and even mankind,
and was formed in the great practice of the Communist Party of China in uniting and leading the
people from prosperity to strength.
Highlighting problem-orientation is the realistic premise of the scientific outlook on practice. The
practice of governing the country by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the
core is generally centered on analyzing and solving problems. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We
must have a strong sense of problems, be guided by major issues, grasp key issues for further
research and thinking, and focus on promoting the resolution of a series of prominent contradictions
and problems facing our country's development." We Chinese Communists have always engaged in
revolution, construction, and reform for the purpose of solving China's practical problems. 1 Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era takes what we are doing
as the center, focuses on the major theoretical and practical issues facing our party, the practical
problems of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, the hot and difficult issues that the
people care about, and the issues of common concern to the international community, actively
provides effective solutions to problems, and adheres to and develops the practical character of
Marxist philosophy.
Promoting theoretical innovation on the basis of practice is an important connotation of the scientific
outlook on practice. The understanding of the laws of objective things can only be done in practice.
Practice determines understanding, is the source and driving force of understanding, is also the
purpose and destination of understanding, and the fundamental thing is to rely on practice to produce
true knowledge. Comrade Xi Jinping uses the Marxist outlook on practice, proceeding from the
changing reality, and insists on summarizing and summarizing and sublimating the theory of fresh
and rich practical experience;

And he has continuously promoted theoretical innovation on the basis of practice, so that Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has a solid practical foundation
and practical support. At the same time, this idea has been tested in practice and has continued to
develop, guiding the process of China's reform and opening up and socialist modernization, and
realizing the benign interaction between theoretical innovation and practical innovation.
Persisting in doing solid work is the fundamental requirement of the scientific outlook on practice.
Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed advocating practical work, vigorously avoiding empty
talk, making one point of deployment and nine points of implementation, stepping on stones to leave
a mark, and grasping iron with traces; clearly requiring that implementation be grasped in the spirit

practice"1 Contemporary China is experiencing the most extensive and profound social changes, and
is also carrying out the most grand and unique practical innovation in human history, which provides
a strong impetus and broad space for theoretical exploration and creation. Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a scientific theoretical system with distinct

Communist Party, socialist construction and the development of human society in the magnificent
and magnificent practice of the new era, and constantly open up a new realm of contemporary
Chinese Marxism and Marxism in the 21st century.
It has been constantly enriched and developed in the new great project of promoting party building.
The profound changes in Shiqian's national conditions and party conditions have put forward higher
requirements for the party to scientifically grasp the trend of the times and conform to the wishes of
the people, and have put forward higher requirements for the party's ability and determination to set
directions, seek overall interests, formulate policies, and promote reform. The more important the
mission and the more arduous the task, the more it is necessary to continue to promote the new great
project of party building, continuously improve the party's ruling ability and leadership level, and
enhance its ability to resist corruption and degeneration, and resist risks.
At what stage the cause of the party and the people has developed, the new great project of party

process of dynamic development, which determines that the Party's theoretical innovation is always

along with new explorations in party building. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China put forward the general requirements and key tasks of party building in the new era, and
made top-level design and strategic arrangements for promoting party building. These requirements

We will continue to enrich and develop the cause of adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics. "Marxism must continue to develop with the development of the times,
practice, and science, and cannot remain static, and socialism has always advanced in exploration.1
On the one hand, the more the socialist cause advances and develops, the more new situations and
problems it will have, and the more risks and challenges it will face; on the other hand, socialism in
our country is still in its initial stage, there are still many problems that have not yet been clarified
and difficult problems to be solved, and the understanding and handling of many major issues are
still in the process of constantly deepening. All this requires a new scientific answer from a
theoretical perspective.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping
as the core will certainly continue to base itself on China's reality, examine the contemporary
development of Marxism with a high degree of theoretical consciousness and theoretical self-
confidence, and respond to the new expectations for theoretical innovation in the further
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the basis of refining and sublimating
practical experience, new ideas, new viewpoints and new theories are put forward, and the
understanding of the law of socialist construction is continuously deepened with new visions, new
words and new creations, and continues to inject new era content into the theoretical system of
socialism with Chinese characteristics. It can be said that the process of winning the great victory
of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is the process of realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the process
of ushering in bright prospects for the scientific socialist movement, and the process of continuous
enrichment and development of the party's theory.
It has been continuously enriched and developed in the process of promoting the construction of a
community with a shared future for mankind. In the 21st century, the world pattern is in the process
of accelerating its evolution, giving rise to a large number of profound and complex practical
problems and putting forward a large number of theoretical topics that need to be answered urgently.
Continuously contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to better advance the cause of
human progress is itself an important content of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era.
