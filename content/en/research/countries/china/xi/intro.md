## Introduction: Marxism in Contemporary China and Marxism in the 21st Century

Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology of the CCP in building the party and the state. 

Keeping pace with the times is the theoretical character of Marxism. 

There was:
- 19th century Marxism for the 19th century
- 20th century Marxism for the 20th century

There must be:
- 21st century Marxism for the 21st century.

Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is contemporary Chinese Marxism and 21st century Marxism. The formation and establishment of this ideology as the guiding ideology that the Party and the state must adhere to for
a long time, held high the spiritual banner for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era, provided a Chinese solution for world peace and human progress, and
was of landmark significance in the history of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the history of
the development of Marxism and the progress of human society.
1. The background of the times in which Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era was formed
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era was put forward to
answer the questions of the times under the historical conditions of the new era of socialism with
Chinese characteristics and complex and profound changes in the world, national and party
conditions.
(1) The world is in a major change unprecedented in a century
Today's world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, which is a major strategic
judgment put forward and repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Xi Jinping after the 18th National
Congress of the CCP by scientifically analyzing the development and changes
of the world situation.

Against the background of historic changes in the relations between contemporary China and the
world, and the closer connection between the future and destiny of contemporary China and the
future and destiny of the world, a profound understanding of this great change will help the whole
party and the people of the whole country better grasp the trend of the times and the general trend
of the world, better grasp the historical opportunities and risks and challenges, and win the initiative
and win advantages in the great changes. This is an important foothold of Xi Jinping's thought on
socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
The most important trend of the great changes in the world is that the international order and the
balance of international power are undergoing fundamental changes. Looking back at history,
today's world pattern is the result of the gradual evolution of the international order after the First
World War. After the First World War, through the Paris Peace Conference and the Washington
Conference, the imperialist powers established the "Versailles-Washington system", which
established the imperialist ruling order in Europe, West Asia, Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, and
the United States gradually replaced Britain as the leader of the Western camp and the leader of the
world order. After the Yalta system after World War II, the drastic changes in Eastern Europe after
the Cold War, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the continuous reconstruction of the global
order, the United States gradually achieved world domination. Since the beginning of the 21st
century, with the development of world multipolarization, economic globalization, social
informatization and cultural diversification, emerging market countries and a large number of
developing countries have risen rapidly, international influence has been continuously enhanced, the
world dominance of Western developed countries has continued to weaken, and the international
pattern has shown a relatively balanced development trend. This was the most revolutionary change
in the international order and the balance of power in more than a hundred years after World War I.
The new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial revolution has promoted the
rapid development of productive forces in today's world, which is an important factor causing great
changes in the world. After the first industrial revolution, the second industrial revolution and the
third industrial revolution, human society has entered an unprecedented period of innovation and
activity. Original breakthroughs in the fields of information, life, manufacturing, energy, space, and
oceans have provided more sources of innovation for cutting-edge technologies and disruptive
technologies, the transformation speed of scientific and technological achievements has accelerated
significantly, the form of industrial organization is undergoing new major changes, and the
reconstruction of the global innovation map and the reshaping of the global economic structure have
become more prominent. Science and technology have never been as profound as they are today,
profoundly affecting the future and destiny of all countries in the world, the production and life of
the people, and profoundly affecting the rise and fall of the strength of various countries.
In today's world changes, the governance deficit, trust deficit, peace deficit and development deficit
are particularly prominent. On the centenary of the end of World War I, the world stepped into the
era of strategic competition between great powers.

The battle for geostrategy, the battle for high technology, the dispute over "new frontiers" such as
the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, and the Internet, the dispute over the dominance of
international regulation, and the dispute over national governance models are in full swing. Regional
conflicts and local wars are emerging one after another, security threats are becoming increasingly
complex and integrated, and the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation
system is facing new challenges. The process of informatization has reshaped the social and political
ecology of various countries, widened the digital divide and gap between the rich and the poor,
spread extremism and terrorism, and raised global challenges such as cybersecurity, major infectious
diseases, and climate change. Protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise, the global pandemic
of the new crown pneumonia epidemic has caused economic globalization to encounter greater
headwinds and waves of reversal, and the world economy has fallen into a deep recession. Countries
face many common threats, live in a more unstable and uncertain world, no country can cope with
it alone or alone, and the world's expectations for a new global architecture are becoming more and
more urgent.
With a history of more than 5,000 years of civilization, China is the world's largest developing
country and the largest socialist country. Since the founding of New China, especially since the
reform and opening up, China has gradually moved towards the world. The process of going global
is also a process of China's sustained and rapid development. With the development and growth of
economic strength and scientific and technological strength, China's international status has been
significantly improved, its international influence has been significantly enhanced, and it has
increasingly approached the center of the world stage. Since the international financial crisis in 2008,
China has contributed more than 30% to world economic growth for many consecutive years,
becoming the main source of world economic growth. China has become a decisive factor in the
changes in the world pattern and an important stabilizing force in the world's great uncertainty.
At this time of great development, great change and great adjustment, China is changing, the world
is changing, and the relationship between China and the world is also changing. How should China
better develop itself and how should it make new and greater contributions to human society? The
questions of the times arising from the great changes require scientific answers from contemporary
Chinese communists. Standing at the height of world history and human civilization, Comrade Xi
Jinping accurately grasps the pulse of the world's general trend with a correct view of history, the
overall situation and the role, deeply analyzes the law of the evolution of the international pattern,
and puts forward a series of pioneering new concepts, ideas and strategies around the questions of
the times, providing Chinese wisdom, Chinese ideas and Chinese solutions for the better future of
the world.
(2) Today, China is in a critical period from becoming rich to strong
When the world is in a major change unprecedented in a century, China's development is in the best
period since modern times.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. After the sustained development since
the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, China's social productive
forces, comprehensive national strength, and people's living standards have achieved a historic leap,
and its economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and national defense strength have
entered the forefront of the world, and it has become the world's second largest economy, the largest
manufacturing country, the largest country in goods trade, the second largest country in commodity
consumption, and the second largest country in the flow of foreign capital, and its foreign exchange
reserves have ranked first in the world for many consecutive years. Today's China has long bid
farewell to the era of poverty and weakness and the era of material shortage; the people's living
standards have achieved a great leap from insufficient food and clothing to moderate prosperity; the
country as a whole has advanced to the period of "after development" pointed out by Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, and is on the road of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and
starting a new journey of building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way.
There is no doubt that we are closer, more confident and capable of realizing the goal of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any time in history, and we are more confident and capable
of making greater contributions to world peace and human progress than at any time in history.
China's social changes are historic, and China's development achievements are historic, but the basic
national conditions in which China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain for a
long time remain unchanged, and China's international status as the world's largest developing
country has not changed. There is a long way to go to persist in developing the party's primary task
of ruling and rejuvenating the country, persist in taking economic construction as the central task of
the party and the country, and comprehensively build a moderately prosperous society, basically
realize socialist modernization, and then comprehensively build a modern and powerful socialist
country in the course of deepening reform and opening up. It should also be noted that the main
contradiction in our society has been transformed into a contradiction between the people's growing
need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. On the one hand, the people's
needs are becoming more and more extensive, not only putting forward new and higher requirements
for material and cultural life, but also putting forward more and higher requirements for democracy,
rule of law, fairness, justice, security, environment, etc.; on the other hand, unbalanced and
insufficient development has become more prominent, which has become the main constraint to
meeting the people's growing needs for a better life. Such characteristics of the times have set new
and higher demands on the work of the party and the state in all fields.
Looking further, the boat to the middle wandering is more urgent, and the road to the mid-level is
steeper. The new era is also a critical period for China's development, a period of tackling difficult
problems in reform and a period of prominent contradictions. The task of reform, development and
stability is unprecedentedly heavy, the number of contradictions, risks and challenges is
unprecedented, and the test of governing the country is also unprecedented. Many old problems
have not yet been fully solved, new ones are emerging, and other countries have no ready-made
experience to draw from. Achieving socialist modernization in a country with a population of 1.4
billion is an unprecedented feat in human history.

Realizing the "two centenary goals" and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation will once again create an earth-shaking development miracle in the history of human
development. In the face of such tasks, challenges, and tests, China's reform needs to "wade into
deep waters" and "break through dangerous shoals," need to overcome the "middle-income trap,"
"Tacitus trap," and "Thucydides trap," and need to guard against and defuse various major risks such
as the "black swan" and "gray rhino" incidents.
Standing at the intersection of history, the CCP and the Chinese urgently need
scientific theories that keep pace with the times to raise the flag and illuminate the future. Xi Jinping
Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is precisely the ideological guide
and spiritual weapon for us to make new achievements and contributions in the new era.
(3) The CCP Faces a New "Rush Test" in the New Era
"Catching up for the exam" is an important point of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era. In July 2013, Comrade Xi Jinping went to Xibaipo to investigate, and
in a discussion with rural cadres and the masses in the county, he said: "When the Party Central
Committee left Xibaipo, Comrade Mao Zedong said that 'going to Beijing to catch up with the exam'.
More than 60 years have passed, we have made great progress, Chinese people have stood up and
become rich, but the challenges and problems we face are still severe and complex. "1
The CCP is indeed facing a new "rush test" in the new era. As the world's
largest party with more than 90 million members and more than 4.6 million grassroots party
organizations, and as a party that has been in power for a long time in a large country with a
population of 1.4 billion, whether or not it can always maintain its advanced nature and purity, and
whether it can always maintain leadership and ruling ability consistent with the mission of ruling
and rejuvenating the country is directly related to the prospects for realizing the "two centenary
goals" and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In the second decade of the 21st century, the CCP has gone through a glorious
course of more than 90 years. The scale of Party members has been continuously expanded, the
structure has been continuously improved, and the quality has been continuously improved, and the
vanguard and exemplary role of Party members and the role of Party organizations as fighting
fortresses have been effectively brought into play. At the same time, there were structural changes
in the party's cadre ranks, cadres born before the founding of New China gradually withdrew from
leading posts, and cadres born in the 60s and even 70s of the 20th century became the main body of
the cadre ranks.

This change of cadres between the old and the new ensures that the cause of the party and the country
is passed on from generation to generation and that the party is vigorous and vigorous. However,
we should also realize that the vast number of middle-aged and young cadres generally lack the
experience of weathering storms and seeing the world in major struggles, and whether they can have
the corresponding fighting spirit and ability to fight in the great struggles with many new historical
characteristics is a major issue that needs to be solved. In particular, profound changes have taken
place in the ruling environment and social conditions facing the party; the tests of ruling, reform and
opening up, market economy, and external environment are long-term, complex, and severe; and the
dangers of mental slackness, lack of ability, separation from the masses, and negative corruption are
more acutely placed before the whole party. How to maintain the party's advanced nature and purity,
and how to ensure that the party always walks in the forefront of the times and can withstand the
tests of various storms and waves, is a major issue that the CPC has always faced in winning the
"catch up with the exam" in the new era.
Adhering to strict party management and courage in carrying out self-revolution is the secret of the
CPC's evolution from weak to strong and constantly moving from victory to victory. However, for
some time now, in some localities and departments, there have been problems of lax and soft
management of the party and party management; some party organizations have been weak and lax
in discipline; some party-member cadres have found it difficult to be supervised; and there have
been many cases of lack or failure to manage the contingent; some party-member leading cadres
have serious problems such as unhealthy work style, wavering beliefs, ideological slippage, moral
aberrations, and corruption, and even violate discipline and law to seize profits, which the masses
of the people deeply loath. If this situation is not changed, it will weaken the party's ability to govern
and shake the party's ruling foundation. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "If the management of
the party is not effective and strict, and the prominent problems within the party that the people
strongly reflect cannot be solved, then sooner or later our party will lose its qualification to govern
and will inevitably be eliminated by history."1
Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, Comrade Xi Jinping has led the
whole party to carry out a new "rush examination" with a strong sense of distress, promoted the
comprehensive and strict management of the party with firm determination, tenacious will and
unprecedented strength, adopted a series of major measures and made arduous efforts, and promoted
the profound transformation of party management from "loose and soft" to "strict and hard", so that
the party has rejuvenated new vitality in the revolutionary forging. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a theoretical summary and ideological crystallization
of comprehensively administering the party strictly, deepens the understanding of the law of Marxist
ruling party building, and demonstrates the high consciousness and superb ability of the Marxist
ruling party in the new era of self-purification, self-improvement, self-innovation and self-
improvement.

2. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has
opened up a new realm of Marxism
A history of the development of Marxism is a history of the continuous development of Marx, Engels
and their successors in accordance with the development of the times, practice and understanding,
and the history of constantly absorbing all the excellent ideological and cultural achievements in
human history to enrich themselves.
The CCP persists in taking Marxism as its guide, persists in integrating the
basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific conditions in the process of leading China's revolution,
construction and reform, constantly promotes the Sinicization of Marxism, and constantly opens up
new realms of Marxism in the course of advancing with the times. After the birth of the Communist
Party of China, it united and led the people to complete the new democratic revolution and socialist
revolution through a long struggle, realizing the great leap of the Chinese nation from being the
"sick man of East Asia" to standing up. In the process of realizing this leap, Mao Zedong Thought,
the theoretical achievement of the first historical leap in the Sinicization of Marxism, was created.
Since the reform and opening up, the Party has united and led the people to carry out the new great
practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, enabling China to make great strides to
catch up with the times and realize the great leap of the Chinese nation from standing up to becoming
rich. The theoretical achievement of this great leap is the realization of the second historical leap in
the Sinicization of Marxism and the formation of a theoretical system of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, including Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thinking of "three represents" and
the scientific outlook on development.
In the new era, the CCP has integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with
China's specific conditions in the new era, united and led the people to carry out great struggles,
build great projects, advance great causes, realize great dreams, and promote historic achievements
and changes in the cause of the party and the country. The theoretical achievement of this great leap
is to realize another new leap in the Sinicization of Marxism and create Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the inheritance and
development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important
thinking of "three represents" and the scientific outlook on development.

It is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism, the crystallization of the practical
experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people, an important part of the theoretical
system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for the whole Party and the
people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation. This ideology adheres to the world outlook methodology of dialectical materialism and
historical materialism, adheres to the people's stand, adheres to the ideological line of seeking truth
from facts, and adheres to the ideals and convictions of communists, and is a model for adhering to
Marxism. This idea is also a model of innovative development of Marxism, which understands and
grasps a series of major strategic issues facing contemporary China's development with a broad and
long-term perspective, and constantly expands new horizons in theory. He made new generalizations
and said many "new words" that had not been said before, and made a major original contribution
to the development of Marxism. These original contributions are profound and systematic, running
through the three major components of Marxist philosophy, political economy and scientific
socialism, covering all aspects of the cause of the party and the country, deepening the understanding
of the law of the Communist Party's ruling power, the law of socialist construction and the law of
the development of human society with a new vision, and writing a new chapter in contemporary
Chinese Marxism and Marxism in the 21st century.
(1) It has deepened the understanding of the law governing the Communist Party
Marx and Engels founded the theory of proletarian parties, but due to the limitations of historical
conditions, they did not lead the practice of ruling the Communist Party. The Communist Party of
the Soviet Union ushered in a brand-new history of a Marxist party holding national political power
and gained a lot of experience in ruling power in practice, but it did not fundamentally solve such
major historical issues as what socialism is, how to build socialism, what kind of party to build, and
how to build the party, and made many major mistakes, including major historical mistakes,
resulting in the loss of power after 74 years in power. Practice has proved that it is not easy for a
Marxist party to seize political power, it is even more difficult to consolidate political power, and it
is especially difficult to hold power for a long time.
Since the CCP came to power, it has always regarded jumping out of the
historical cycle rate of "its prosperity is also vigorous, and its death is also sudden" as a historical
topic that must be solved well in the party's long-term ruling power, and has continuously expanded
its understanding of the law governing the Communist Party in the practice of administering the
party and the country. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, focusing on achieving the long-term
ruling goal, Comrade Xi Jinping, with the political consciousness that "iron must be hard by itself,"
has continuously deepened theoretical exploration and practical creation of the CPC's ruling law,
put forward a series of new concepts, new ideas and new strategies for party building, enriched and
developed Marx's theory on political parties, and guided the practice of comprehensively
administering the party strictly to achieve great achievements.

This idea creatively puts forward that the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the leadership of the CCP, the greatest advantage of the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the CCP, and
the party is the highest political leading force of the country. This fundamentally and highly
expounds the party's historical position and core role in leading the development of the socialist
cause, profoundly reveals the most fundamental and important issue in the ruling law of the
CCP, and clarifies the ambiguous understanding that has existed inside and
outside the party on the issue of party leadership for some time.
This ideology creatively puts forward the need to uphold and strengthen the party's comprehensive
leadership, stressing the need to enhance political awareness, awareness of the overall situation, core
awareness, and awareness of alignment, and consciously safeguarding the authority of the party
Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership; stressing the need to improve the party's
leadership system and mechanism, enhance the party's ability and determination to set the direction,
seek the overall situation, formulate policies, and promote reform, and ensure that the party always
controls the overall situation and coordinates all parties. This is not only a profound summary of the
historical experience of the CCP, but also a systematic exposition of the
fundamental requirements, practical path, and goal orientation of upholding and strengthening the
party's leadership in the connection between history and reality.
This idea creatively puts forward that the courage of self-revolution is the most distinctive character
of the CCP and is also the greatest advantage of the Party; it emphasizes that
all comrades in the Party must maintain the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary fighting spirit,

(2) It has deepened the understanding of the law governing socialist construction
Over the past 500 years, socialism has undergone the evolution from utopia to science, from theory
to practice, and from the practice of one country to the practice of many countries, which has
profoundly changed the development process of world history. In the late 80s and early 90s of the
20th century, with the drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union,
world socialism suffered serious setbacks. Once upon a time, the so-called "conclusion of the end
of history," "theory of the defeat of socialism," and "theory of the collapse of China" were very
popular. Thirty years have passed, with the vigorous development of the cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the world has witnessed the end of the "conclusion of the end of history",
the collapse of the "theory of the collapse of China", and the failure of the "theory of the defeat of
socialism"; the contest between the two roads, two systems and two isms in the world is undergoing
profound changes in favor of socialism and Marxism, and scientific socialism has radiated strong
vitality in China in the 21st century. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
for a New Era uses Marx's position and viewpoint method, adheres to what we are doing as the
center, adheres to problem awareness and problem orientation, condenses the essence of the times,
and summarizes practical experience.

the people. This has established the CPC's outlook on the people in the new era, further demonstrated
the fundamental value stand of Marxism for the interests of the people, and deepened the
understanding of socialist values and goals.
In the stage of socialist development, this thinking has made a major political conclusion on the
basis of accurately judging that the main contradiction in our society has been transformed into the
contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate
development. This has further enriched and developed the Marxist outlook on the times and injected

Chinese characteristics to a new scientific level.

two steps on the basis of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, basically
realize socialist modernization by 2035, and build China into a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power by the middle of this century. This has

with Chinese characteristics in the new era
Ingels pointed out: "The theoretical thinking of every era, including that of our time, is a product of
history, which has completely different forms and at the same time completely different contents in
different eras. "1 The historical mission to be fulfilled by a political party in a period and the issues
of the times to be solved by a generation of leaders at a stage are all determined by the requirements
of the times and the wishes of the people at that time. Since the reform and opening up, the CPC's
innovative theory has always focused on answering major questions of the times, from "what is
socialism and how to build socialism", to "what kind of party to build and how to build the party",
to "what kind of development to achieve and how to develop.” The basic issues affecting the
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics as it enters a new era boil down to what kind
of socialism with Chinese characteristics to uphold and develop, and how to uphold and develop
socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is undoubtedly a new topic in the new era.

mental state it takes, and what historical mission it undertakes from the perspective of the long-term
peace and stability of the party and the country, and from the perspective of the future and destiny
of socialism. A series of fundamental questions, such as what kind of goal to achieve, once again
show the world that China will neither follow the old road of closure and rigidity, nor follow the
evil path of changing the banner, but will unswervingly take the clear position of taking the road of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, pointing out the way forward for China in the new era.
——Profoundly answered the question "where did socialism with Chinese characteristics come
from.” It is further emphasized that socialism with Chinese characteristics is the dialectical unity of
the theoretical logic of scientific socialism and the historical logic of China's social development.

the combination of history and reality, theory and practice, domestic and international, and forms
systematic ideological views in all fields and aspects, which is a rich connotation, systematic and
complete, interconnected and logical ideological system. The report of the 19th CPC National
Congress summarized the main contents of this ideological system with "Eight Definites" and

4. Comrade Xi Jinping is the main founder of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the crystallization
of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people, and its main founder
is Comrade Xi Jinping, as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party.
In the great practice of leading the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country to promote the development of the cause of the party and the country,
Comrade Xi Jinping, with the profound insight, keen judgment and determination of Marxist
politicians, theorists and strategists, put forward a series of groundbreaking new ideas, ideas and
strategies, which played a decisive role and made decisive contributions to the establishment of Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era.
(1) Comrade Xi Jinping's firm political belief and simple people's feelings have injected powerful
spiritual genes into this thinking
All great ideas carry their founder's own value stance and value judgment, reflecting his deeply
rooted beliefs and ideals. Great ideas run through the sincere and ardent pursuit of faith, exude
simple and rich humanistic care, and thus inspire, inspire and unite people. Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is such a great idea
Comrade Xi Jinping has the red foundation of firm faith. He was born in a revolutionary family with
a red family style tutor and received a strict revolutionary traditional education from an early age,
which enabled him to establish a firm belief in communism and socialism and a heroic feeling that
"revolutionary ideals are higher than heaven.” The power of his parents' example and example made
him unwavering in his original intention and beliefs even when his life was most difficult. He has
written 8 applications for the People's League and 10 applications for the People's Party, so that
many foreigners lament that "Xi Jinping has the genes of patriotism and loyalty to faith."
Comrade Xi Jinping has the feeling of being close to the people and loving the people. At the age
of 15, he went to Liangjiahe on the northern Shaanxi plateau to join the queue, and his father and
fellow villagers in northern Shaanxi accepted him with warm arms and influenced him with his
simple and simple qualities, which made him personally feel the simplicity, kindness, integrity and
selflessness of the people when he was a teenager, and set up the youthful aspiration to do something
practical for the masses and change the poor and backward appearance of Liangjiahe.
China Aerospace Studies Institute

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
The tempering of his career as a young person has enabled Comrade Xi Jinping to understand the
national conditions, but also the hearts of the people, and harvest a treasure book of life that can be
used for life without writing a word. He once recalled, "As a public servant of the people, the
Northern Shaanxi Plateau is my roots, because it has cultivated my unchanging belief: to do practical
things for the people!" In 1982, he resolutely gave up his work in the central organs, went down to
the grassroots level, and returned to the masses. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has clearly put forward the people-centered development
thinking and taken the yearning of all the people for a better life as the party's goal. This is not only
the natural expression of his consistent feelings for the people, but also his greatest political
confidence in not forgetting his original intention and forging ahead.
(2) Comrade Xi Jinping's rich cultural accumulation and solid philosophical literacy have laid a
profound theoretical foundation for this thought
Throughout the ages, any great theory has been full of the penetrating power of thought, the vitality
of logic, and the appeal of words, which can inspire people, give people warmth, and give people
strength. The reason why Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era exudes infinite charm is closely related to the rich cultural accumulation and solid philosophical
literacy of its founder.
Comrade Xi Jinping has a profound cultural heritage. He has a deep affection for traditional Chinese
culture, and always conveys his thoughts with classic phrases that are natural and human. He has a
wide range of foreign masterpieces, including famous writers and literary masterpieces in Russia,
the United States, France, Germany, Britain, India and other countries. "Thousands of miles are not
a day's work.” Comrade Xi Jinping said that his biggest hobby is reading. At the age of 15, he put
forward to himself the requirements of reading and self-cultivation that "I don't know anything and
I am deeply ashamed.” When he went to Liangjiahe to cut the queue, he brought two "dead and
dead" book boxes, and under the kerosene lamp in the dead of night, he could always be seen
immersed in reading. After entering politics, he still maintained the good habit of reading, not only
regarded reading as a way of life, but also strongly advocated to love, read, and read well. It is this
kind of persistent mass reading and deep thinking that cultivates his rich knowledge and profound
insights, giving his thoughts a broad vision and profound foundation.
Comrade Xi Jinping has solid philosophical literacy. When he joined the queue in northern Shaanxi,
he became deeply interested in philosophy, often holding the "brick-thick" Marxist classics to study
diligently, and devoted great efforts to studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
China Aerospace Studies Institute
19
Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
When he studied Capital, he wrote a full 18 notebooks. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, he
has issued a call to the whole party to "study philosophy and use philosophy," regard Marxist
philosophy as the housekeeping skill of the Chinese communists, lead the Politburo of the Central
Committee to collectively study dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and set an
example for the whole party. It is precisely because of the long-term study and study of philosophy,
especially Marxist philosophy, that Comrade Xi Jinping has developed keen and profound
philosophical thinking, mastered systematic and complete philosophical methods, and successfully
used them to guide the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Whether it is works
such as "Knowing the Deepest Love," "Getting Out of Poverty," "Walking in the Forefront in
Practical Practice," and "Zhijiang Xinyu" when working at the local level, or a series of important
speeches made after working in the Central Committee, especially since the 18th CPC National
Congress, all of them run through the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and
historical materialism, and all shine with the light of wisdom of Marxist philosophy.
(3) Comrade Xi Jinping's long-term hard work and solid political experience have accumulated
sufficient practical nutrients for this thinking
The process of the emergence of the leaders of the proletarian party is a process of historical
selection, as well as a process of constantly shaping and testing the character qualities of individuals.
Only those who have the whole world in mind, care for the people, and have the feelings of home
and country, those who are strategic, full of wisdom and strategic, can withstand the severe test of
adversity, be pampered, calm in their dealings, stand out in the torrent of the times, and be chosen
by history and the people. Comrade Xi Jinping's long-term hard work at the grassroots level and
solid political experience at multiple levels and positions have accumulated sufficient practical
nutrients for the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in
the New Era.

Comrade Xi Jinping is the leader of our Party who grew up in the face of adversity. Xi Jinping was
9 years old when Comrade Xi Zhongxun was wronged in 1962. During his father's mistreatment, he
was criticized, starved and even wandered, and at the age of 15, he took the initiative to join the
team in northern Shaanxi to become a farmer, and worked for seven years. Among the "old three"
educated youth, Comrade Xi Jinping is one of the very few educated young people who are the
youngest, go to the most difficult places, and have spent the longest time in the countryside. In the
face of such an environment, he experienced self-cultivation in the arduous struggle, cultivated a
tenacious, persevering and strong character, and forged a feeling of self-improvement and lofty
ambitions. Years of grinding in the countryside have allowed Comrade Xi Jinping to complete the
first transformation in his life, allowing him to truly understand what is practical, what is seeking
truth from facts, and what is called the masses."

Comrade Xi Jinping is a leader of our Party who has been trained in the practice of politics in many
fields and at multiple levels. Judging from the growth process of Comrade Xi Jinping, the seven
years of knowing youth are the "origin" of his original aspiration for the people and the formation
of his thoughts. The three years of Zhengding, an agricultural county in the central Hebei Plain, was
a "test field" for him to display his political talents and show his historical responsibility. The series
of ideas and measures he put forward at that time fully reflected his innovative spirit, pragmatic
style and responsibility, and became the practical foundation and ideological source accumulated in
Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In the political
practice of Fujian, a southeast coastal province for more than 17 years, his political ability and
governance ability have been comprehensively experienced and displayed, focusing on "getting rid
of poverty" when he was in Ningde, blowing the "clarion call" for state-owned enterprise reform
when he was in Fuzhou, and putting forward the strategic concept of "ecological province"
construction and "digital Fujian" when he was governor, etc., so many innovative actions constitute
an important practical foundation and important source of thought for Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era. The six years in charge of Zhejiang and
Shanghai were a crucial period for Comrade Xi Jinping's politician quality to be comprehensively
improved, and also a crucial period for the formation of his thinking on governing the country. From
proposing the implementation of the "Eight-Eight Strategy" to bring Zhejiang on the fast track of
development to deepening the people's promotion of Shanghai's reform and opening up, these
strategic and overall thinking and practices have fully prepared and tested him for planning the great
chess game of national development in the future.

(4) Comrade Xi Jinping's extraordinary political boldness and superb political wisdom have opened
up a broad vision for this thought
Times make heroes. Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, Comrade
