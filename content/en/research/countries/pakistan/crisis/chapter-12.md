Pakistan's energy sector is in crisis. 

Power outages of up to 18 hours a day disrupt the lives of people and threaten the economy in an unprecedented way. Despite
abundant installed capacity the power system is mired in critical
operational issues including a pervasive circular debt. 

Payment arrears between various entities has jammed the flow of funds through the power
supply-chain, and deprived fuel suppliers and independent power
producers of cash to the extent that their viability and therefore output is
jeopardised. 

Demand is outstripping supply at a time when the country's security situation imposes obvious constraints. But if the energy deficit is
not urgently tackled it contains the seeds of dangerous social unrest.

Equally disquieting is the fact that energy policy initiatives being promoted today are the same as those proposed some thirty years ago,
indicating little implementation progress in the intervening years while the crisis deepened.

How can this situation be remedied? In light of overwhelming evidence that the absence of a coordinated energy policy remains a
fundamental constraint, an integrated approach needs to be established
together with an institutional structure that supports it. 

This was partially
implemented in Pakistan in the 1980s but faded away subsequently with
the increasing fragmentation of policy institutions and functions. Without
integration, decision-making remains inherently flawed and policy
initiatives are reduced to shooting in the dark.

The country has the capacity to speedily revive the integrated approach together with the first steps of a supporting institutional
structure. The rest of the institutional changes can be phased in gradually. 

This will enable policy-makers to rapidly tackle, on an informed basis, the urgent and longer-term problems facing the sector, replacing the current ad hoc approach which reacts to, rather than averts, crises. It will help pave the way for the recovery of the energy sector that can then aid the economic rebound. It is not so much the availability of resources but how
they are managed which makes the difference between success and failure.


### State of the Energy Sector

Pakistan's policy-makers have done a reasonably good job of articulating (repeatedly through several five-year planning cycles) policy objectives for the energy sector.' The broad objective is to develop the sector to support an expanding economy. Developing indigenous resources, importing energy at competitive prices to meet deficits, expanding delivery infrastructure and improving energy efficiency and reliability, would enhance energy supplies. 

Security of energy supply would be increased by greater reliance on national resources thus reducing import dependence, and by diversification of energy supplies to manage risks and external shocks. Long- term viability of the sector would be supported by a shift in the role of government from owner to that of policy-maker and regulator, encouraging the private sector to own and run the energy companies through appropriate incentives, including attracting foreign and local private capital and deploying competitive processes.

Also, the objectives contain consumer- oriented, eco-friendly and pro-poor elements, promoting service-provision, environmental protection and affordable energy for the underprivileged. Despite these laudable objectives the sector is in a dire state. The problem is not a lack of clarity on what needs to be done but how it is to be done.

Before considering solutions, it is essential to briefly review the state of the sector, the gravity of issues, and why the situation has become so serious. The official Pakistan Energy Yearbook 2009 lays out the supply and consumption picture. Total primary energy supply in Pakistan is 63 MTOE (Million Tons of Oil Equivalence) of which natural gas accounts for 48 per cent, oil 32 per cent, hydroelectricity 11 per cent and coal around 7 per 245cent. Nuclea1 LPG and imported electricity make up the remaining 2 per cent. Pakistan imports a third of its energy requirements mainly in the form of oil and coal, despite huge proven reserves of coal and a significant exploration potential of oil. Over 80 per cent (17 MTOE) of Pakistan's oil requirements are imported at a prohibitive cost of $12 billion a year, and over 60 per cent (3 MTOE) of its coal supplies come from overseas.

The official figure for total energy consumption is 37 MTOE, the difference between supply and consumption being the losses in conversion, processing, transmission, distribution, as well as non-technical losses, which is a euphemism for theft. The industrial sector is the dominant consumer with over 40 per cent of the market. The transport sector consumes just over 30 per cent and households around 22 per cent. The remainder consists mainly of commercial and agricultural consumers.

The Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan (HDIP) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources produces an impressive document, the Energy Yearbook, based on input from various energy­ related ministries and agencies. The quality of information and analysis is testament to the fact that, despite the serious brain drain from Pakistan, islands of excellence remain. This offers hope for the future and gives pause to those who maintain that the situation is beyond redemption. There is, however, a glaring omission, which reflects the preoccupation of policy-makers. The data pertains only to commercial energy, i.e., energy for consumers connected to national grids and billed for services.

Estimates of non-commercial or traditional forms of energy are missing. Data in this area is sporadic and much less reliable, mainly because of the conspicuous lack of attention accorded to it. If non- commercial energy is included, the supply picture changes dramatically. Traditional biofuels (fuelwood and other biomass) head the list, followed, in descending order, by natural gas, oil, hydro and coal. On the consumption end, again, a starkly different picture emerges. Households become the primary consumer using 50 per cent of the mix. Biofuels account for over 85 per cent of household energy use, of which fuelwood is the largest component followed by biomass, and crop residues.

The most egregious aspect of the omission is that non-commercial energy use accounts for nearly half of the overall demand for energy in Pakistan. By including non-commercial energy in the calculations, policy- 246makers will be forced to consider major shifts in emphasis. Supply and consumption patterns are presented in Table 1 below.

Note: Non-commercial primary energy supply not shown due to inadequate data. In one sense, the historical neglect of non-commercial energy seems understandable. 

Commercial energy is a key ingredient for national growth and prima facie warrants the lion's share of attention, particularly if growth has been stymied, as has often been the case in Pakistan, and there is pressure on policy-makers to jump-start the economy. There is an inherent fallacy in this approach. While commercial energy consumers contribute significantly to GDP growth, neglected non-commercial consumers drag down national output over the longer term by unregulated and unchecked practices and technologies, which waste energy and denude forestry resources by harvesting beyond the maximum allowable cut, i.e. beyond the level at which the forestry resource becomes unsustainable. 

Although the economic, social and environmental implications of the neglect requires a separate detailed study, we only need to look around us to see the disastrous effects on the degradation of forests and eco-systems, and the poverty that this approach has engendered over the past sixty-four years.

In evaluating the state of the sector in relation to the economy, three other parameters are significant. First, data from the Energy Yearbook and the Economic Survey clearly show that growth in energy consumption and economic growth have followed almost identical patterns for the last decade and a half, reaffirming that energy fuels the economy and its shortage curbs growth. 

The second is Pakistan's per capita energy consumption, which at 0.49 TOE is significantly lower than the world average of 1.78. This reflects the country's level of development. As energy availability is a key determinant in the standard of living, this parameter is also indicative of the high incidence of poverty.

The third is Pakistan's energy consumption per dollar of GDP growth, which is around 0.82 against the world average of 0.32. This illustrates the relative inefficiency of energy use in Pakistan and highlights the pressing need to strengthen policy initiatives that encourage greater utilisation efficiency. In a constrained energy supply situation, any improvement in efficiency means adding to the supply.

The above figures are based on commercial energy but if non- commercial energy is included, the comparisons are likely to be even more pronounced. Moreover, the household sector, which is the largest consumer and where waste is greatest, would become the focus of improving energy efficiency. 

By excluding non-commercial energy, the industrial sector appears as the largest consumer and therefore the focus of attention. This does not imply that the industrial sector should be overlooked. There are many low-cost and no-cost initiatives that can be implemented here. But it is important to strike the right balance between available financial resources and the concentration of effort.

Pakistan's energy resource potential is substantial and remains largely unharnessed although not all of it is currently financially or technically exploitable. This potential is in the form of depleting fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) as well as renewables (hydro, solar, wind, wood fuels and agricultural residues). Among fossil fuels, in the petroleum (oil and gas) sub-sector, Pakistan has a large prospective area (or, in geological language, sedimentary basin) covering 830,000 square kilometres. Probable reserves are estimated at twenty-seven billion barrels of oil and 282 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas.

Of this, 936 million barrels of oil had been confirmed and 609 million barrels produced till 2007, leaving 327 million barrels of proven reserves yet to be recovered. The reserves-to-production ratio stands at fourteen, critically low considering the high and growing level of oil imports, and compared with the worldwide ratio of forty. For natural gas, 53 TCF have been confirmed, of which 23 TCF were produced till 2007, leaving 30 TCF of proven reserves. The reserves-to-production ratio is twenty-one— uncomfortably low given Pakistan's heavy dependence on natural gas as the primary commercial fuel, and in comparison with a worldwide ratio of 59.

Till early 2009, 725 exploratory wells had been drilled which
resulted in over 219 oil and gas discoveries. This works out to a drilling
density of 1.99 wells per 1,000 square kilometres—far lower than the
world average of ten. However, the success rate of 1:3.3 is much better
than the world average of 1:10. The success rate coupled with the large
sedimentary basin implies that if the exploration level is increased, there
are good chances of significantly raising the level of proven reserves and,
consequently, production of oil and gas. This, however, is proving
difficult since vast portions of the sedimentary basin lie in areas where
security deters any significant exploration—more so as such activity is
usually carried out by international oil companies with their own
manpower and risk capital.

Pakistan's indigenous coal reserves are huge, estimated at 186 billion
tons, of which the Thar deposit of 175 billion tons is the fifth largest in
the world. Proven reserves stand at 1,980 million tons and at the present
249production level the reserves-to-production ratio is well over 400. This
signals the need to enhance production significantly. However, most of this
coal is of low quality (high sulphur and ash content) and is located in
remote areas. Its exploitation therefore requires expensive excavation,
treatment and transport infrastructure, in areas where security is a concern.
Renewable energy sources are also significant. Hydroelectric
potential in Pakistan is an impressive 41,700 MW of which only 6,600
MW or 16 per cent has been harnessed till today. For mini-hydro (units up
to 5 MW capacity), the potential is about 1500 MW of which only 60 MW
(4 per cent) has been tapped. Pakistan's almost entirely untapped wind
energy potential, according to the USAID Renewable Energy Lab, is
estimated at 41,000 MW of power generation based on areas of favourable
wind regimes.

Solar energy is abundant and remains unharnessed except for a few
isolated projects. If only 0.25 per cent of the land area of the province of
Balochistan were covered by solar panels of 20 per cent efficiency, this
would be enough to provide electricity to the entire country. However, the
feasibility of generating large quantities of wind and solar power (while
improving with continuing research) is highly questionable. Estimates for
non-commercial sources, mainly wood fuels, are less reliable. These
resources are considerable and constitute 45 per cent of the energy supply
mix for the country. However, there is ample evidence that in several parts
of the country, unregulated harvesting of this poorly managed resource is
severely impairing its sustainability.

The current state of the energy deficit and its projected growth is
even more worrisome for the future. Data from the Planning Commission,
although ignoring non-commercial energy, illustrates the magnitude of the
crisis ahead. It projects an annual energy demand increasing from the
present level of around 60 MTOE to 198 MTOE by the year 2025. This is
based on an annual economic growth of 6.5 per cent. While not consistent
with recent trends, this could be envisioned over the longer term, with an
abating global financial crisis and a cautiously optimistic view of
Pakistan's economic regeneration.

The total indigenous supply over the same period increases from
around 40 MTOE to only 75 MTOE. Oil and gas supplies are assumed to
increase only slightly in line with constraints on future exploration
250activities. In contrast, indigenous energy from coal, hydroelectricity,
nuclear and non-traditional renewable sources, are assumed to increase
significantly in an attempt to offset limitations in oil and gas. The resulting
deficit grows from the already disquieting level of around 20 MTOE to a
staggering 122 MTOE by 2025. These figures, perhaps more than any
other, underscore the fragility of the energy sector, implying a long-term
dependence on external sources. This is neither a viable nor affordable
scenario.

Three characteristics of Pakistan's energy sector take on special
significance. First, the indigenous resource potential is substantial, not-
withstanding some critical exploitation issues. Two, the energy deficit is
prohibitively large and expanding. Three, nearly half the population,
mainly the rural poor, is not connected to the commercial grids and relies
on non-commercial energy. This combination often tempts policymakers to
promote the harnessing of all forms of energy available. This is a common
trap, particularly in a severely cash-strapped environment such as
Pakistan. In this approach, for example, undue priority is given to
renewable forms such as solar and wind, since they are considered free and
able to reach poor, remote localities. Such forms of energy are indeed 'free'
since they are constantly renewable, but they are not necessarily cheap.
Moreover, they do little to close large deficits. Even compared with
nuclear power generation, itself an expensive option, wind power is
around 60 percent more expensive and solar about 30 per cent.
Nevertheless, to support poverty alleviation objectives under severe
budgetary constraints, all options should be on the table but a mechanism
needs to be in place to strike an affordable balance. The degree of
departure from the optimum can make the difference between success and
failure of energy policy.

How did we get here? How this dire state of affairs came about is
analysed in a noteworthy work, which traces the history of the downward
spiral and milestones along the way. The path is characterised by 'stop-go'
reforms, policy reversals, bureaucratic delays and missed opportunities
and, over the last decade or so, a growing security crisis. Through all this,
there were some sound and well-intentioned policy initiatives and
concerted efforts towards implementation. However, these efforts could
not yield the desired results in a policy environment, which lacked the
necessary fundamentals.

251A few examples illustrate the dilemma. In the early 1980s, there
were four international oil companies, which had been granted concessions
for exploration in Pakistan. Such companies commonly deploy their own
capital for exploration, relying on satisfactory profit sharing or
production-sharing agreements with the government to recoup their
expenditures once commercial production begins. Drilling conditions
were difficult and expensive with deep wells in high-pressure areas but
discovery prospects were good. However, a major oil company, on the verge
of a significant discovery, decided to suspend drilling operations and leave the
country. The net effect was to discourage further exploration at a time when
at least ten companies were considering the possibility of exploring in
Pakistan with their own capital for the first time—a possibility that could have
turned around the country's energy future.

A combination of factors led to the oil company's departure. Among
them was the inflexibility of the bureaucracy to address glaring anomalies in
the tax structure, which severely eroded the cash flow of the company
especially in areas with high exploration costs. The second, more significant
reason was that, under the prevailing policy regime, oil and gas prices could
only be negotiated after commercial discovery. This was a major disincentive
for a company deploying its own capital in expensive operations. Rising
expenditures in an uncertain post-discovery regime was enough to warrant a
pull-out even on the verge of discovery, to the detriment of Pakistan's
economy. Pakistan's policy­makers failed to understand that the country was
competing with others across the world in attracting scarce exploration risk
capital. For this, it needed to make its pricing regime as attractive as possible. If
there had been a mechanism to rapidly assess the economic penalty of the policy,
which traded immense long-term benefits for short-lived financial gains, the story
would have been different. It is a credit to subsequent policy-makers that these
retrogressive policies were amended. This is now reflected in the government's
exploration promotion and investment promotion documents. However by the
time this was done conditions had changed. The security situation became a key
deterrent to exploration. This underscores a lost opportunity, one of many policy
actions offering too little, too late.

At around the same time, another petroleum company involved in a joint
venture with the government had decided to sell to the government its shares
in a natural gas field development operation, which provided valuable
nitrogen-rich gas feedstock to the fertilizer industry. It took over a year to
negotiate the sale price and government inter­locutors were able to reduce the
252purchase price by a significant amount. This could be considered a major gain
but for one serious repercussion. Through the protracted negotiations, the field
expansion program was put on hold, resulting in immense losses in revenue to
the joint venture itself, as well as to the fertilizer industry, and in terms of
lost agricultural productivity due to lack of fertilizer. Again, a mechanism
to assess the penalty could well have prompted speedier negotiations with
less immediate financial gains but with vastly greater financial and
economic benefits in the longer term.

Perhaps the most significant example of lost opportunities relates to
Central Asia in the early to mid-90s when all six of the newly independent
republics, under immense internal economic pressures, were actively
seeking avenues to export their surplus energy. Strong consideration was
given to the southern corridor through Pakistan to tap the large energy-
starved South Asian market as well as gain access to ports on the Arabian
Sea for further extending export. This was well before the security
situation in Afghanistan had begun to deteriorate. As expected, there were
competitors promoting alternative routes. The Great Game was on again,
being played with higher stakes and at electronic speed.

Central Asian authorities and international consortia made several
attempts to pursue discussions with Pakistani authorities but progress was
elusive. One thing was evident. The level of interest and effort of the
competitors drowned out the lukewarm response of the Pakistani
government and private sector. The rest is history. 

One can only surmise
how the trade corridors, had they been established, would have
transformed the regional scenario. Revenue from trade and from
transporting energy across the region would have brought immense
benefits to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both countries, as well as India,
would have also benefited from greatly enhanced energy supplies. The
resulting prosperity and trade links would certainly have strengthened
interdependence among the three countries and helped mitigate the
conflict which currently engulfs the region.
