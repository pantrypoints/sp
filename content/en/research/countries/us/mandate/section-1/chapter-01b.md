### STAFF SECRETARY

The Office of the Staff Secretary is rarely visible to the outside world, but it performs work of tremendous importance. The office is similar to a military commander’s adjutant as it is responsible for fielding and managing a vast amount of information going in and out of the Oval Office.

Because of its gatekeeping function, the position of Staff Secretary is one of extreme trust and is the “honest broker” in the President’s service.

OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS

This operates under the Director of Communications. It conveys the President’s agenda to the public through various media, including speeches and remarks, press briefings, off-the-record discussions with reporters, and social media. 

It can include the Office of the Press Secretary (Press Office).

Operational functions of the Office of Communications include scheduling and running press briefings, interviews, meetings, media appearances, speeches, and a range of other events.

The Office of Communications must maintain robust relationships with the White House Press Corps, the White House Correspondents’ Association, regional stakeholders, and key interest groups.

No legal entitlement exists for the provision of permanent space for media on the White House campus, and the next Administration should reexamine the balance between media demands and space constraints on the White House premises. Leadership within the Office of Communications should include a Communications Director (who is a direct report to the Chief of Staff ), a Deputy

The Office of the Staff Secretary has been described as the last substantive control point before papers reach the Oval Office. A great deal of information is headed toward the Oval Office at any moment. This includes presidential decision memos; bills passed by Congress (which may be accompanied by signing or veto statements); and briefing books, reading materials, samples of constituent mail, personal mail, and drafts of speeches. The Staff Secretary makes certain that these materials are complete, well-ordered, and up to date before they reach the Presi- dent. This necessarily means that the Staff Secretary plays a key role in determining who weighs in on policy matters and when.

As noted above, the Staff Secretary also handles information leaving the Oval Office. The President may have questions after reviewing incoming material, may wish to seek more information, or may demand revisions. The Staff Secretary is often responsible for directing these requests to the appropriate places and following up on them to ensure that they are completed. One of the Staff Secretary’s critical functions is managing and overseeing the clearance process for the President’s daily/nightly briefing book. This book is filled with all the reading material and leading documentation the President needs in the morning and the evening to help him make decisions. The Staff Secretary also oversees the use of the President’s signature, whether by hand or by autopen, and manages the Office of the Executive Clerk, Office of Records Management, and Office of Presidential Correspondence.

Communications Director, a Deputy Director for Strategic Communications, and a Press Secretary. This leadership team must work together closely to drive the national narrative about the White House. The best resource for the Office of Communications is the President. The Pres- ident conveys the White House’s overall message through one or two inaugural addresses, State of the Union addresses, speeches to Congress, and press confer- ences. The office must also ensure that the various White House offices disseminate a unified message to the public. The Communications Director and Press Secretary in particular should be careful to avoid contradicting the President or delivering conflicting information.

The speechwriting team is a critical component of the communications team. Speechwriting is a unique talent: The writers selected must understand policy, should have a firm grasp of history and other liberal-arts disciplines, and should be able to learn and adopt the President’s style of rhetoric and mode of delivery. The Press Secretary is the President’s spokesperson, communicating to the American people through the media. The Press Secretary engages with the White House Press Corps formally through press briefings and informally through impromptu gaggles and meetings. Individuals who serve in this role must be quick on their feet, which means, when appropriate, deftly refuting and rebutting corre- spondents’ questions and comments.


The Communications Director must convey the President’s mission to the American people. Especially for conservatives, this means navigating the main- stream media to ensure that the President’s agenda is conveyed effectively and accurately. The Communications Director must be politically savvy and very aware of the ongoing activities of the other White House offices. The new Administration should examine the nature of the relationship between itself and the White House Correspondents Association and consider whether an alternative coordinating body might be more suitable.


### OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS (OLA)

Created by President Dwight Eisenhower, the OLA has continued to serve as the liaison between the White House and Congress. The White House must work with congressional leaders to ensure presidential nominees, for roles such as Cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, are confirmed by the Senate. The White House also relies on Congress to enact reforms promised by the President on the campaign trail, whether those promises relate to health care, education, or national defense. Because Congress holds the power of the purse, White House staffers must ensure that there is enough support on the Hill to secure the necessary funding through the appropriations process to fulfill the President’s agenda. The OLA reports directly to the Chief of Staff and in some Administrations has done so under the guidance of a Deputy Chief of Staff (usually the Deputy Chief


### OFFICE OF PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL (PPO)

The political axiom that “personnel is policy” was popularized under President Ronald Reagan during the 1981 presidential transition. One of the most important offices in the White House is the PPO, which was created under President Richard Nixon to centralize political appointments. Departments and agencies had and still have direct legal authority on hiring and firing, but the power to fill Schedule C posi- tions—the core of political jobs—is vested with the President. Therefore, the White House, not the department or agency, has the final word on political appointments. PPO’s primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President’s agenda. Although its focus should be identifying and recruiting leaders to fill the approximately 1,000 appointments that require Senate confirmation, PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration’s political leadership.

for Policy). Regardless of the person to whom the OLA reports, however, the office exercises a certain autonomy on behalf of the President and the Chief of Staff in directly influencing congressional leaders of both major political parties. The OLA often must function as the mediator among the parties and find common ground to facilitate the successful enactment of the President’s agenda. As is the case with many White House offices (but especially the Office of Com- munications), the OLA must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message. If other actors within the White House maintain their own relationships with congressional leaders and staffers, it may appear that the President’s agenda is fractured and lacks consensus. This dynamic has caused real problems for many Presidents in the past.


Internally, OLA staffers need to be involved in policy discussions, budget reviews, and other important meetings. They must also provide advice to policy staffers regarding whether certain ideas are politically feasible. Externally, OLA staffers have to communicate continuously with congressional offices of both parties in both the House and the Senate to ensure that the President has enough support to enact his legislative priorities or sustain votes.

The OLA requires staffers who are effective communicators and can provide a
dose of reality to other White House staffers when necessary. Although a policy
proposal from within the White House may be a great idea, OLA staffers must
ensure that it is politically feasible. OLA staffers must therefore be skilled in both
politics and policy. Furthermore, the President should seek out individuals who
can advance his agenda and at the same time forge pathways with members of the
opposing political party on other priorities.
Most important, the OLA must function as a well-oiled machine: precisely
synced. The President cannot afford to have a tennis player on—much less as the
leader of—his football team.

Frequently, many medium-tier and top-tier jobs have been filled by policy
experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration. At
the same time, appointees in the entry-level jobs have brought invaluable energy
and commitment to the White House and have proved to be the “farm team” for
the conservative movement.

The Office of Presidential Personnel is responsible for:

Vetting potential political personnel by conducting political background
checks and reviewing any clearance and fitness assessments by departments
and agencies.
Making recommendations to the President and to other appointment
authorities on behalf of the President.
Identifying programmatic political workforce needs early and developing
plans (for example, Schedule F).

Identifying potential political personnel both actively through recruitment
and passively by fielding resumes and adjudicating requests from
political actors.

Maintaining a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) both for operational purposes and to effectuate the President’s direct
Title 5 authorities. The President is in charge of the federal workforce and
exercises control principally by working through the Director of the Office
of Personnel Management.
Training and connecting political personnel.
Playing “bad cop” in a way that other White House offices cannot
(including serving as the office that takes direct responsibility for firings
and hirings).
Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the
executive branch.

In most Administrations, PPO will staff more than 100 positions during a transi-
tion and thousands of noncareer positions during the President’s first term. Direct
authority and a strong relationship with the President are necessary attributes for
any PPO Director. Historically, PPO has had direct review and control of personnel
files, including security clearance dossiers.

At the highest level, PPO is tasked with long-term, strategic workforce devel-
opment. The “billets” of political appointments are of immense importance in
credentialing and training future leaders. In addition, whatever one’s view of the
constitutionality of various civil service rules (for example, the Federal Vacancies
Reform Act of 19986) might be, it is necessary to ensure that departments and
agencies have robust cadres of political staff just below senior levels in the event
of unexpected vacancies.
