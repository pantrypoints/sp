A large national government can hire good people through merit selection.

The government did so for years, but it has proven difficult in recent times to select personnel based on their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) as the law dictates. 

Yet for the past 34 years, the U.S. civil service has been unable to distinguish consistently between strong and unqualified applicants for employment. As the Carter presidency was winding down, the U.S. Department of Justice and top lawyers at the OPM contrived with plaintiffs to end civil service IQ exam- inations because of concern about their possible impact on minorities.

The OPM had used the Professional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE) gen- eral intelligence exam to select college graduates for top agency employment, but Carter Administration officials—probably without the President’s informed con- currence—abolished the PACE through a legal consent court decree capitulating to demands by civil rights petitioners who contended that it was discriminatory. The judicial decree was to last only five years but still controls federal hiring and is applied to all KSA tests even today.

General ability tests like the PACE have been used successfully to assess the use- fulness and cost-effectiveness of broad intellectual qualities across many separate occupations. Courts have ruled that even without evidence of overt, intentional discrimination, such results might suggest discrimination. 

This doctrine of disparate impact could be ended legislatively or at least narrowed through the regulatory process by a future Administration. In any event, the federal government has been denied the use of a rigorous entry examination for three decades, relying instead on self-evaluations that have forced managers to resort to subterfuge such as preselecting friends or associates that they believe are competent to obtain qual- ified employees.

In 2015, President Barack Obama’s OPM began to introduce an improved merit
examination called USAHire, which it had been testing quietly since 2012 in a few
agencies for a dozen job descriptions. The tests had multiple-choice questions with
only one correct answer. Some questions even required essay replies: questions that would change regularly to depress cheating.

President Donald Trump’s OPM
planned to implement such changes but was delayed because of legal concerns
over possible disparate impact.
Courts have agreed to review the consent decree if the Uniform Guidelines
on Employee Selection Procedures setting the technical requirements for sound
exams are reformed. A government that is unable to select employees based on
KSA-like test qualifications cannot work, and the OPM must move forward on this
very basic personnel management obligation.

The Centrality of Performance Appraisal. In the meantime, the OPM must
manage the workforce it has. Before they can reward or discipline federal employees,
managers must first identify who their top performers are and who is performing
less than adequately. In fact, as Ludwig von Mises proved in his classic Bureaucracy,14
unlike the profit-and-loss evaluation tool used in the private sector, government
performance measurement depends totally on a functioning appraisal system. If
they cannot be identified in the first place within a functioning appraisal system, it is
impossible to reward good performance or correct poor performance. The problem
is that the collegial atmosphere of a bureaucracy in a multifaceted appraisal system
that is open to appeals makes this a very challenging ideal to implement successfully.


The GAO reported more recently that overly high and widely spread performance ratings were again plaguing the government, with more than 99 percent of
employees rated fully successful or above by their managers, a mere 0.3 percent
rated as minimally successful, and 0.1 percent actually rated unacceptable.15 Why?
It is human nature that no one appreciates being told that he or she is less than
outstanding in every way. Informing subordinates in a closely knit bureaucracy
that they are not performing well is difficult. Rating compatriots is even consid-
ered rude and unprofessional. Moreover, managers can be and often are accused
of racial or sexual discrimination for a poor rating, and this discourages honesty.

In 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order 1383916 requiring agencies to reduce the time for employees to improve performance before corrective
action could be taken; to initiate disciplinary actions against poorly performing
employees more expeditiously; to reiterate that agencies are obligated to make
employees improve; to reduce the time for employees to respond to allegations
of poor performance; to mandate that agencies remind supervisors of expiring
employee probationary periods; to prohibit agencies from entering into settlement
agreements that modify an employee’s personnel record; and to reevaluate proce-
dures for agencies to discipline supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers.
Unfortunately, the order was overturned by the Biden Administration,17 so it will
need to be reintroduced in 2025.

The fact remains that meaningfully evaluating employees’ performance is a
critical part of a manager’s job. In the Reagan appraisal process, managers were
evaluated on how they themselves rated their subordinates. This is critical to﻿

responsibility and improved management. It is essential that political executives
build policy goals directly into employee appraisals both for mission success and
for employees to know what is expected. Indistinguishable from their coworkers
on paper, hard-working federal employees often go unrewarded for their efforts
and are often the system’s greatest critics. Federal workers who are performing
inadequately get neither the benefit of an honest appraisal nor clear guidance on
how to improve. Political executives should take an active role in supervising per-
formance appraisals of career staff, not unduly delegate this responsibility to senior
career managers, and be willing to reward and support good performers.

### Merit Pay

Performance appraisal means little to daily operations if it is not tied
directly to real consequences for success as well as failure. According to a survey of
major U.S. private companies—which, unlike the federal government, also have a
profit-and-loss evaluation—90 percent use a system of merit pay for performance
based on some type of appraisal system. Despite early efforts to institute merit pay
throughout the federal government, however, compensation is still based primarily
on seniority rather than merit.


Merit pay for executives and managers was part of the Carter reforms and was
implemented early in the Reagan presidency. Beginning in the summer of 1982,
the Reagan OPM entered 18 months of negotiations with House and Senate staff
on extending merit pay to the entire workforce. Long and detailed talks between
the OPM and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress ensued, and a final
agreement was reached in 1983 that supposedly ensured the passage of legislation
creating a new Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) for all,
(not just management) GS-13 through GS-15 employees.

Meanwhile, the OPM issued regulations to expand the role of performance
related to pay throughout the entire workforce, but congressional allies of the
employee unions, led by Representative Steny Hoyer (D) of government employee–
rich Maryland, stoutly resisted this extension of pay-for-performance and, with
strong union support, used the congressional appropriations process to block OPM
administrative pay reforms. Bonuses for SES career employees survived, but per-
formance appraisals became so high and widely distributed that there was little
relationship between performance and remuneration.

Ever since the original merit pay system for federal managers (GM-13 through
GM-15 grade levels, just below the SES) was allowed to expire in September 1993,
little to nothing has been done either to reinstate the federal merit pay program for
managers or to distribute performance rating evaluations for the SES, much less to
extend the program to the remainder of the workforce. A reform-friendly President
and Congress might just provide the opportunity to create a more comprehensive
performance plan; in the meantime, however, political executives should use exist-
ing pay and especially fiscal awards strategically to reward good performance to
the degree allowed by law.

Making the Appeals Process Work. The nonmilitary government dismissal
rate is well below 1 percent, and no private-sector industry employee enjoys the
job security that a federal employee enjoys. Both safety and justice demand that
managers learn to act strategically to hire good and fire poor performers legally.
The initial paperwork required to separate poor or abusive performers (when they
are infrequently identified) is not overwhelming, and managers might be motivated
to act if it were not for the appeals and enforcement processes. Formal appeal in the
private sector is mostly a rather simple two-step process, but government unions
and associations have been able to convince politicians to support a multiple and
extensive appeals and enforcement process.

As noted, there are multiple administrative appeals bodies. The FLRA, OSC,
and EEOC have relatively narrow jurisdictions. Claims that an employee’s removal
or disciplinary actions violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement
between an agency and a union are handled by the FLRA, employees who claim
their removal was the result of discrimination can appeal to the EEOC, and employ-
ees who believe their firing was retribution for being a whistleblower can go to the
OSC. While the MSPB specializes in abuses of direct merit system issues, it can
and does hear and review almost any of the matters heard by the other agencies.
Cases involving race, gender, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, or national
origin can be appealed to the EEOC or the MSPB—and in some cases to both—and
to the OSC. This gives employees multiple opportunities to prove their cases, and
while the EEOC, MSPB, FLRA, and OSC may all apply essentially the same burden
of proof, the odds of success may be substantially different in each forum. In fact,
forum shopping among them for a friendlier venue is a common practice, but fre-
quent filers face no consequences for frivolous complaints. As a result, meritorious
cases are frequently delayed, denying relief and justice to truly aggrieved individuals.
The MSPB can and does handle all such matters, but it faces a backlog of an
estimated 3,000 cases of people who were potentially wrongfully terminated or
disciplined as far back as 2013. From 2017–2022 the MSPB lacked the quorum
required to decide appeals. On the other hand, as of January 2023, the EEOC had
a backlog of 42,000 cases.

While federal employees win appeals relatively infrequently—MSPB adminis-
trative judges have upheld agency decisions as much as 80 percent of the time—the
real problem is the time and paperwork involved in the elaborate process that
managers must undergo during appeals. This keeps even the best managers from
bringing cases in all but the most egregious cases of poor performance or mis-
conduct. As a result, the MSPB, EEOC, FLRA, and OSC likely see very few cases
compared to the number of occurrences, and nonperformers continue to be paid
and often are placed in nonwork positions.
Having a choice of appeals is especially unique to the government. If lower-pri-
ority issues were addressed in-house, serious adverse actions would be less subject﻿

to delay. With the proper limitation of labor union actions, the FLRA should
have limited reason for appeals. The EEOC’s federal employee section should be
transferred to the MSPB, and many of the OCS’s investigatory functions should be
returned to the OPM. The MSPB could then become the main reviewer of adverse
actions, greatly simplifying the burdensome appeal process.

Making Civil Service Benefits Economically and Administratively Rational. In recent years, the combined wages and benefits of the executive branch civilian workforce totaled $300 billion according to official data. But even that amount does not properly account for billions in unfunded liability for retirement and other government reporting distortions. Official data also report employment as approximately 2 million, but this ignores approximately 20 million contractors who, while not eligible for government pay and benefits, do receive them indirectly through contracting (even if they are less generous). Official data also claim that national government employees are paid less than private-sector employees are paid for similar work, but several more neutral sources demonstrate that pub- lic-sector workers make more on average than their private-sector counterparts. All of this extravagance deserves close scrutiny.
