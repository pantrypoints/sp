### Needed Reforms

Reform the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution
(PPBE) process.

1.
Enhance funding and authority for DOD mission-focused innovation
organizations and away from program-specific stovepipes that,
planned for and designed two or three years earlier, may no longer be

The DOD’s ability to acquire and field new and existing technologies is essential
to the ability of America’s military personnel to fight and win our nation’s wars.
To succeed in this endeavor, we must optimize the systems and personnel that
the department uses, but the inflexible bureaucratic structure and risk-adverse
culture that have developed over the decades make it difficult to provide the tools
that warfighters need at the speed of relevance.
The number one problem is the DOD budgeting process (instituted in 1961)
that requires acquisition spending to be locked years in advance. Because tech-
nologies change so rapidly and requirements can change overnight, this creates
situations in which military personnel not only go to war with outdated technol-
ogy, but also may be fighting with equipment that is less capable than that of their
competitors. America owes its military many things, and the most important is
the resources they need to survive on the battlefield and carry out the tasks we
ask of them.

relevant. This allows the acquisition community to focus on portfolio
management and move money around more easily instead of being
locked into inflexible, multiyear procurement cycles.
2. The President should examine the recommendations of the
congressionally mandated Commission on Planning, Programming,
Budgeting, and Execution Reform4 and develop a strategy for
implementing those that the Administration considers to be in the best
interests of the American people. The commission’s final report is due
on September 1, 2023.
3. Develop legislation or other means of providing funding outside the
traditional PPBE process for the prototyping and experimentation of
emerging technologies that are deemed essential to modernization and
future conflict. Consider creating a “fast track” for projects that satisfy
the most pressing national security needs.

4. Require the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment, the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering,
and all service secretaries to conduct “Night Court” and use existing
authorities to terminate outdated or underperforming programs
so that money can be used for what works and will work. Require
the Under Secretaries and service secretaries to brief the Secretary
annually on the results.
5. Require the Office of the Secretary of Defense to research and report
on the acquisition processes used by America’s adversaries to improve
our understanding of how they are often able to innovate and field new
technologies on a faster timeline.
l
Strengthen America’s defense industrial base.
1.
Replenish and maintain U.S. stockpiles of ammunition and other
equipment that have been depleted as a result of U.S. support to Ukraine.
This will strengthen the defense industry supply chain and ensure that
adequate inventory exists if it is needed for a future conflict.
2. Collaborate with industry to develop a prioritized list of reforms that
the DOD and Congress can enact and implement to incentivize industry
to help America’s military innovate and field needed capabilities.

3. Strengthen the ability of acquisition authorities to engage in multiyear
procurements and block buys. This will improve private-sector rates of
return, thereby incentivizing defense contractors to partner with the
government. It will also reduce government overhead by reducing the
number of procurement competitions.
4. Prioritize the U.S. and allies under the “domestic end product”
and “domestic components” requirements of the Build America,
Buy America Act.5 Currently, defense companies are required to
manufacture defense items for the U.S. government that are 100
percent domestically produced and at least 50 percent composed of
domestically produced components. However, there are loopholes that
allow companies to manufacture these items overseas. This can create
supply chain and other issues, especially in wartime. Manufacturing
components and end products domestically and with allies spurs
factory development, increases American jobs, and builds resilience in
America’s defense industrial base.
6. Help small businesses to become medium-size and large vendors, which
encourages a more resilient industrial base and fosters competition.
Encourage and plan for durable supply chains for small businesses
so they also have commercial/private-sector customers and are not
solely dependent on defense orders, which can be highly specialized,
expensive, and irregular.

7. Increase external engagement among small businesses to inform them
of DOD’s needs and how they could work with DOD to meet national
security priorities.

Optimize the DOD acquisition community.

1.
Create incentives to emphasize speed and agility in decision-making
for prototyping and program-of-record starts and terminations.
Most bureaucrats would rather follow a checklist and fail than go
outside the procedures and win because failure means negative

5. Review the sectors currently prioritized for onshoring or
“friendshoring” of manufacturing (kinetic capabilities, castings and
forgings, critical materials, microelectronics, space, and electric vehicle
batteries); evaluate them according to the strategic landscape; and
expand or reprioritize the list as appropriate.
career repercussions. Senior acquisition leaders should design a
system that allows decision-makers to stay within the law but bypass
unnecessary departmental regulations that are not in the best interest
of the government and hamper the acquisition of capabilities that
warfighters require.
﻿
2. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,
Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, and all service
secretaries should assess their acquisition workforces; determine what
additional personnel, resources, and training they need; and develop
implementation plans. The goal is to develop, prototype, acquire, and
field required capabilities at the speed of relevance to meet America’s
pacing threats and maintain a warfighting advantage.
3. Decentralize Defense Acquisition University (DAU) offerings and
expand the DAU mission to include accreditation of non-DOD
institutions. The critical shortage of trained and certified acquisition
personnel must be addressed with urgency in order to support DOD
mission objectives and goals. With the rapid evolution of training and
educational technologies, including remote and virtual practices, there
is no reason for DAU to maintain a monopoly on the knowledge and
certification that are required to perform as acquisition professionals.
Further, the cost to private contractors and non-DOD civilians who
aspire to such a role limits the supply of trained and certified candidates.
DAU has become an unnecessary barrier to entry in a career field that is
vital to the DOD mission.
