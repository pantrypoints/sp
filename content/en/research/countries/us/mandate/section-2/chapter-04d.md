The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act established the position of
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and assigned broad
responsibility for “all defense research and engineering, technology develop-
ment, technology transition, prototyping, experimentation, and developmental
testing activities and programs, including the allocation of resources for defense
research and engineering, and unifying defense research and engineering efforts
across the Department,” to the new Under Secretary, who also was tasked with
“serving as the principal advisor to the Secretary on all research, engineering,
and technology development activities and programs in the Department.” 6 This
led to the single largest DOD structural change since the Goldwater–Nichols
act of 19867 and was organized effectively during President Donald Trump’s
Administration.

Needed Reforms

Champion, engage, and focus the American innovation ecosystem.
To maintain leadership in the era of great-power competition and
succeed against our adversaries, a key DOD effort must be the creation
of mechanisms and processes to embrace America’s most significant
competitive advantage: innovation.

1.
Engage and leverage all of America’s scientific, engineering, and high-
tech production communities to research, develop, prototype, and
rapidly deploy advanced technology capabilities on a continuing basis to
preserve our warfighting advantage.
2. Increase integration and collaboration among the DOD, government labs,
and private companies to solve the department’s most difficult problems.
3. Reduce the number of critical technology areas from 14 to a more
manageable number to concentrate effort and resources on those that
bear directly on great-power competition.
5. Move toward a much more comprehensive independent risk-reduction
approach to increase understanding of the technical risks by drawing
on the expertise in DOD laboratories and agencies to help acquisition
programs succeed.
l
Improve the rapid deployment of technology to the battlefield.
America’s military advantage has derived from the professionalism of our
servicemembers and our ability to manifest our technological advantage
in battlefield capability. The current era of great-power competition will
continue for the foreseeable future, and technology will be the currency of
competition. Our ability to prevail will rest on our ability to develop new
technologies and move them onto the battlefield more rapidly than our
adversaries can.
1.
Accelerate the prototyping cycle to meet immediate battlefield needs.
2. Require tighter integration with user communities to provide value.

4. Rebuild RDT&E infrastructure that resides in Cold War–era facilities
and is not well-suited to the current era of rapid development and
testing of advanced technology and concepts to the maturity level
necessary for acquisition and operational fielding.
3. Establish a pipeline of near-term, mid-term, and long-term technology
that is aimed at great-power competition (China) and can be matured,
prototyped, and evaluated to support major acquisitions (the ability to
produce at scale) to break the cycle of schedule delays and cost overruns
from underdeveloped and poorly understood technologies.
l
Develop a framework to protect the RDT&E enterprise from foreign
exploitation. Strategic competition and adaptive adversaries require new
thinking about how to protect technology. China has been relentless in
stealing U.S. technology, using the full range of measures from influence
operations to outright theft. This has been a major factor in its ability to
close the gap and in some cases to exceed U.S. capabilities.
1.
Implement a comprehensive approach to preserving U.S. technological
leadership that is based on outpacing our adversaries; clear about what we
need to protect; tailored to various specific sectors (for example, academia,
the defense industrial base, and laboratories); and underpinned with a full
range of consequences for attempted or actual theft.

DOD FOREIGN MILITARY SALES

The United States must regain its role as the “Arsenal of Democracy.” In fiscal
year (FY) 2021, U.S. government foreign military sales (FMS) nosedived to a low of
$34.8 billion from a record high of $55.7 billion in FY 2018.8 

This decrease hinders
interoperability with partners and allies, decreases defense industrial base capac-
ity, and increases the taxpayer burden on the U.S. military’s own procurements.
Under previous Administrations, the United States built its reputation as a reliable
partner with a strong defense industrial base that could supply military articles
and goods in a timely manner. Today’s FMS process is encumbered by byzantine
bureaucracy, long contracting times, high costs, and mundane technology.
The United States can change this downward trajectory by improving inter-
nal processes that incentivize partners and allies to procure U.S. defense systems,
thereby expanding our “defense ecosystem.”

We must reverse the recent dip in
FMS to ensure both that our partners remain interoperable with the United States
and that our defense industrial base regains much-needed capacity in preparation
for future challenges.

Needed Reforms

Emphasize exportability with U.S. procurements. The record-low
FMS sales in 2021 were driven partly by the high costs of converting
weapon systems on the back end of production rather than emphasizing
exportability in initial capability planning.


1.
Ensure that senior U.S. military leadership emphasizes exportability in
the initial development of defense systems that are both available and
interoperable with our partners and allies.
2. Create a funding mechanism to incentivize exportability in initial
planning, which can be recouped after future FMS transactions.
l
End informal congressional notification. Informal congressional
notification or “tiered review” is a hinderance to ensuring timely sales to
our global partners. The tiered review process is not codified in law; it is
merely a practice by which the Department of State provides a preview of
prospective arms transfers before Congress is formally notified.9
1.
End the tiered review process to eliminate at least 20 days from the
FMS process.
2. Use the tiered review process only when unanimous congressional
support is guaranteed in order to eliminate the “weaponization” by
select Members of Congress that has prevented billions of dollars of
arms sales from moving into formal congressional notification.
﻿
l
Minimize barriers to collaboration. The high cost of developing
advanced defense platforms requires the United States to collaborate with
key allies to minimize waste, complement strengths, and supplement our
defense industrial base to create a system that is greater than that of the
United States alone.
1.
Enhance defense industrial base planning with partners to allow
them to focus on niche areas where there are cost advantages for the
United States.
2. Decrease International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to facilitate
trade with such allies as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
3. Create opportunities to improve the health of the defense supply chain
with added opportunities for partners and allies to contribute.
l
Reform the FMS contracting process. The contracting timeline for the
FMS process is shockingly slow. On average, the DOD contracting timeline
takes approximately 18 months because of slow bureaucratic processes and
chronic understaffing.10
 
1.
Immediately fund more contracting capacity in all services to decrease
the contracting timeline and improve the delivery of defense articles to
our global partners.
2. Rationalize and speed arms sales decision-making to preclude our
enemies from exploiting bureaucratic slothfulness and allow us to
manage the development of indigenous defense industrial bases.
