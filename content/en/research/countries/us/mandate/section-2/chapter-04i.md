Nuclear deterrence is one of the most critical elements of U.S. national security,
as it forms a backstop to U.S. military forces. Every operational plan relies on the
assumption that nuclear deterrence holds. Ever since the U.S. first acquired nuclear
weapons, Administrations of both parties have pursued a strategy designed to deter
nuclear and non-nuclear attack; assure allies; and, in the event of nuclear employ-
ment, restore deterrence at the lowest possible cost to the U.S. Today, however,
America’s ability to meet these goals is increasingly challenged by the growing
nuclear threats posed by our adversaries.
l
China is pursuing a strategic breakout of its nuclear forces, significantly
shifting the nuclear balance and forcing the U.S. to learn how to deter two
nuclear peer competitors (China and Russia) simultaneously for the first
time in its history.
Russia is expanding its nuclear arsenal and using the threat of nuclear
employment as a coercive tactic in its war on Ukraine.
lNorth Korea is advancing its nuclear capabilities.
lIran is inching closer to nuclear capability.
Meanwhile, all U.S. nuclear capabilities and the infrastructure on which they
rely date from the Cold War and are in dire need of replacement. The next Admin-
istration will need to focus on continuing the effort to modernize the nuclear triad
while updating our strategy and capabilities to meet the challenges presented by
a more threatening nuclear environment.

Prioritize nuclear modernization. All components of the nuclear triad are
far beyond their intended lifetimes and will need to be replaced over the next

decade. This effort is required for the U.S. to maintain its nuclear triad—and
will be the bare minimum needed to maintain U.S. strategic nuclear deterrence.
1.
Accelerate the timelines of critical modernization programs including the
Sentinel missile, Long Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), Columbia-class
ballistic missile submarine, B-21 bomber, and F-35 Dual Capable Aircraft.
2. Reject any congressional proposals that would further extend the
service lives of U.S. capabilities such as the Minuteman III ICBM.
3. Ensure sufficient funding for warhead life extension programs (LEP),
including the B61-12, W80-4, W87-1 Mod, and W88 Alt 370.
Develop the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N). In 2018,
the Trump Administration proposed restoring the SLCM-N to help fill a
growing gap in U.S. nonstrategic capabilities and improve deterrence against
limited nuclear attack.39 The Biden Administration canceled this program
in its 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).40 The next President should
support and accelerate funding for development of the SLCM-N with the
goal of deployment by the end of the decade.
﻿
l
l
Account for China’s nuclear expansion. To ensure its ability to deter
both Russia and the growing Chinese nuclear threat, the U.S. will need more
than the bare minimum of nuclear modernization. President Biden’s 2022
NPR described the problem but proposed no recommendations to restore or
maintain nuclear deterrence.
1.
Consider procuring more modernized nuclear systems (such as the
Sentinel missile or LRSO) than currently planned.
2. Improve the ability of the U.S. to utilize the triad’s upload capacity in
case of a crisis.
3. Review what capabilities in addition to the SLCM-N (for example,
nonstrategic weapons or new warhead designs) are needed to deter the
unique Chinese threat.
l
Restore the nuclear infrastructure. The United States must restore
its necessary nuclear infrastructure so that it is capable of producing and
maintaining nuclear weapons.
— 124 —Department of Defense
1.
Accelerate the effort to restore plutonium pit production, which is essential
both for modern warhead programs and for recapitalizing the stockpile.
2. Continue to invest in rebuilding infrastructure, including facilities at
the National Laboratories that support nuclear weapons development.
3. Restore readiness to test nuclear weapons at the Nevada National
Security Site to ensure the ability of the U.S. to respond quickly to
asymmetric technology surprises.
l
Correctly orient arms control. The U.S. should agree to arms control
agreements only if they help to advance the interests of the U.S. and its allies.
1.
Reject proposals for nuclear disarmament that are contrary to the goal
of bolstering deterrence.
2. Pursue arms control as a way to secure the national security interests of
the U.S. and its allies rather than as an end in itself.


### MISSILE DEFENSE

This can help to deter attack by instilling doubt that an attack will work as intended,
take adversary “cheap shots” off the table, and limit the perceived value of missiles as tools of coercion. It also allows space for diplomacy during a crisis and can protect U.S. and allied forces, critical assets, and populations if deterrence fails.41
Adversaries are relying increasingly on missiles to achieve their aims.

China and Russia, in addition to their vast and growing ballistic missile
inventories, are deploying new hypersonic glide vehicles and investing in
new ground-launched, air-launched, and sea-launched cruise missiles that
uniquely challenge the United States in different domains.
North Korea has pursued an aggressive missile testing program and is
becoming increasingly belligerent toward South Korea and Japan.
Iran continues to maintain a missile arsenal that is capable of striking U.S.
and allied assets in the Middle East and Europe, and its rocket launches
demonstrate that it either has or is developing the ability to build ICBMs.


3. Prepare to compete in order to secure U.S. interests should arms control
efforts continue to fail.

Missile defense has been underprioritized and underfunded in recent years. In
light of these growing threats, the incoming Administration should treat missile
defense as a top priority.


#### Needed Reforms

Champion the benefits of missile defense. Despite its deterrence and
damage-limitation benefits, opponents argue incorrectly that U.S. missile
defense is destabilizing because it threatens Russian and Chinese second-
strike capabilities.

1.
Reject claims made by the Left that missile defense is destabilizing
while acknowledging that Russia and China are developing their own
advanced missile defense systems.

2. Commit to keeping homeland missile defense off the table in any arms
control negotiations with Russia and China.42

Strengthen homeland ballistic missile defense. The United States
currently deploys 44 Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) as part of its
Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system to defend the homeland
against North Korea, but as North Korea improves its missile program, this
system is at risk of falling behind the threat.43

1.
Buy at least 64 of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), which is more
advanced than the GBI, for an eventual uniform fleet of interceptors.44
The Biden Administration currently plans to buy only 20.

2. Consider additional steps to strengthen the GMD system such as a
layered missile defense or a third interceptor site on the East Coast.

Increase the development of regional missile defense. As the Ukraine
conflict amply demonstrates, U.S. regional missile defense capabilities are
very limited. The United States has been unable to supply our partners
reliably with any capabilities, and the number and types of regional missile
defense platforms are less than the U.S. needs for its own defense. The U.S.
should prioritize procurement of more regional defense systems such as
Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Standard Missile-3, and
Patriot missiles.

Change U.S. missile defense policy. Historically, the U.S. has chosen
to rely solely on deterrence to address the Russian and Chinese ballistic missile threat to the homeland and to use homeland missile defense only against rogue nations.

1. Abandon the existing policy of not defending the homeland against
Russian and Chinese ballistic missiles and focus on how to improve
defense as the Russian and Chinese missile threats increase at an
unprecedented rate.45
2. Invest in future advanced missile defense technologies like directed
energy or space-based missile defense that could defend against more
numerous missile threats.

Invest in new track-and-intercept capabilities. The advent of
hypersonic missiles and increased numbers of cruise missile arsenals by
threat actors poses new challenges to our missile defense capabilities.
1. Invest in cruise missile defense of the homeland.46

2. Accelerate the program to deploy space-based sensors that can detect
and track missiles flying on nonballistic trajectories.47

3. Accelerate the Glide Phase Interceptor, which is intended to counter
hypersonic weapons.
