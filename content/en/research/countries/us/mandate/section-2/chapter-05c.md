#### Legislative Proposals

Title 42 authority in Title 8. Create an authority akin to the Title 42
Public Health authority that has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic
to expel illegal aliens across the border immediately when certain non-
health conditions are met, such as loss of operational control of the border.
Mandatory appropriation for border wall system infrastructure. The
monies appropriated would be used to fund the construction of additional
border wall systems, technology, and personnel in strategic locations in
accordance with the Border Security Improvement Plan (BSIP).

Appropriation for Port of Entry infrastructure. Border security is not
addressed solely by systems in between the ports of entry. POEs require
technology and physical upgrades as well as an influx of personnel to meet
capacity demands and act as the literal gatekeepers for the country. This is
the first line of defense against drug and human smuggling operations.

The current border security crisis was made possible by glaring loopholes
in our immigration system. The result was a preventable and predictable his-
toric increase in illegal and inadmissible encounters along our southern border.
This pulled limited resources from the front lines of our nation’s borders and
away from their national security mission, releasing a vast and complex set
of threats into our country. To regain our sovereignty, integrity, and security,
Congress must pass meaningful legislation to close the current loopholes and
prevent future Administrations from exploiting them for political gain or per-
sonal ideology.


Unaccompanied minors

1.
Congress should repeal Section 235 of the William Wilberforce
Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA),9
which provides numerous immigration benefits to unaccompanied
alien children and only encourages more parents to send their children
across the border illegally and unaccompanied. These children too often
become trafficking victims, which means that the TVPRA has failed.
2. If an alternative to repealing Section 235 of the TVPRA is necessary,
the section should be amended so that all unaccompanied children,
regardless of nationality, may be returned to their home countries in a
safe and efficient manner. Currently, the TVPRA allows only children
from contiguous countries (Canada and Mexico) to be returned while
every other unaccompanied minor must be placed into a lengthy
process that usually results in the minor’s landing in the custody of an
illegal alien family member.
﻿
3. Congress must end the Flores Settlement Agreement by explicitly
setting nationwide terms and standards for family and unaccompanied
detention and housing. Such standards should focus on meeting human
needs and should allow for large-scale use of temporary facilities (for
example, tents).
4. Congress should amend the Homeland Security Act and portions of
the TVPRA to move detention of alien children expressly from the
Department of Health and Human Services to DHS.


Asylum reform
1.
The standard for a credible fear of persecution should be raised and
aligned to the standard for asylum. It should also account specifically for
credibility determinations that are a key element of the asylum claim.
2. Codify former asylum bars and third-country transit rules.
3. Congress should eliminate the particular social group protected ground
as vague and overbroad or, in the alternative, provide a clear definition
with parameters that at a minimum codify the holding in Matter of A-B-
that gang violence and domestic violence are not grounds for asylum.10


Parole reform. Congress should end the widespread abuse of parole in
contravention of statute and return it to its origins as an extraordinary
remedy for very limited purposes.

NGOs and processing. Congress should halt funds given to
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to process and transport
illegal aliens into and throughout the United States. Such funds and
infrastructure, including the DHS joint processing centers, should be
redirected to secure the border, detain aliens, and provide space for
immigration court proceedings.

Other pathways for border crossers. While Congress should use its
oversight authority to ensure that Expedited Removal is used to the fullest
extent and followed to the letter of the law, other paths for border crossers
should be included in a legislative package.

1.
Migrant protection protocols. Update the statutory language
providing the basis for the Remain in Mexico program as needed to
withstand judicial scrutiny and executive inaction.
3. Other expedited pathways. Congress should explicitly permit
programs akin to the Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR) and
Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (HARP) programs.

Employment authorization
1.
Congress should reassert control of employment authorization, which is
subject to rampant regulatory abuse, and limit it to certain categories of
legal immigrants and non-immigrants.
2. Congress should also permanently authorize E-Verify and make
it mandatory.


2. Asylum Cooperative Agreements. While the agreements themselves
must be negotiated, Congress should mandate that the executive branch
work faithfully to negotiate and execute ACAs and set parameters
to ensure that an unwilling executive cannot renege on an existing
agreement or abandon the effort.

1.
Congress should unequivocally authorize state and local law
enforcement to participate in immigration and border security actions
in compliance with Arizona v. United States.11
2. Congress should require compliance with immigration detainers to
the maximum extent consistent with the Tenth Amendment and set
financial disincentives for jurisdictions that implement either official or
unofficial sanctuary policies.

Prosecutorial discretion. Congress should restrict the authority for
prosecutorial discretion to eliminate it as a “catch-all” excuse for limiting
immigration enforcement.

Mandatory detention. Congress should eliminate ambiguous
discretionary language in Title 8 that aliens “may” be detained and clarify
that aliens “shall” be detained. This language, which contrasts with other
“shall detain” language in statute, creates unhelpful ambiguity and allows the
executive branch to ignore the will of Congress.

#### Regulations

Withdraw Biden Administration regulations and reissue new regulations in the following areas:

1. Credible Fear/Asylum Jurisdiction for Border Crossers.
2. Public Charge.

T-Visa and U-Visa reform. Unless and until T and U visas are repealed,
each program needs to be reformed to ensure that only legitimate victims
of trafficking and crimes who are actively providing significant material
assistance to law enforcement are eligible for spots in the queue.
Repeal TPS designations.
H-1B reform. Transform the program into an elite mechanism
exclusively to bring in the “best and brightest” at the highest wages while
simultaneously ensuring that U.S. workers are not being disadvantaged by
the program. H-1B is a means only to supplement the U.S. economy and to
keep companies competitive, not to depress U.S. labor markets artificially in
certain industries.

Employment authorization. Along with the legislative proposal, take
regulatory action to limit the classes of aliens eligible for work authorization.

#### Executive Orders

Pathways for border crossers
1.
Direct the Department of State and the Department of Homeland
Security to reinstate Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Northern
Triangle Countries immediately.
2. Recommence negotiations with Mexico to fully implement the Remain
in Mexico Protocols.
3. Reinstate, to the extent possible, expedited pathways with full credible
fear/immigration court process (PACR and HARP).
4. Prohibit the use of Notices to Report, the use of any funds for travel
into the interior of the United States, and government flights or
transportation for aliens.
6. Eliminate the use of ATD for border crossers except in rare cases and
only with the explicit authority of the Secretary.
7.
l
Prohibit the use of parole except in matters that are certified by the
Secretary of Homeland Security as requiring action for humanitarian or
significant public benefit reasons, and prohibit the use of parole in any
categorical circumstance.

Enforcement
1.
Restrict prosecutorial discretion to eliminate it as a “catch-all” excuse
for limiting immigration enforcement.
2. Mandate the use of E-Verify for anyone doing business with
the government.


5. Mandate that ICE use all detention space in full compliance with
Section 235 of the INA, issue weekly reports on detention capacity, and
provide authority for low-level temporary capacity (for example, tents)
once permanent space is full.
3. Designate USCIS as Intelligence Community–adjacent, ensuring that it
has access to national security and law enforcement databases.
4. Rescind all memoranda limiting enforcement of immigration laws
including those identifying sensitive zones.
5. End ICE’s widespread use of termination and administrative closure of
cases in immigration court.
l
Averting or curtailing a mass migration event

1.
Provide that whenever the Secretary of Homeland Security determines
that an actual or anticipated mass migration of aliens en route to or
arriving off the coast of the U.S. presents urgent circumstances requiring
an immediate federal response, the Secretary may make, subject to the
approval of the President, rules and regulations prohibiting in whole or
in part the introduction of persons from such countries or places as he
or she shall designate in order to avert or curtail such mass migration
and for such period of time as is deemed necessary, including through
the expulsion of such aliens. Such rule and regulation making shall not
be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.
2. Provide that notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the
Secretary makes such a determination and then promulgates, subject to
the approval of the President, such rules and regulations, the Secretary
shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements of Title 8 that
the Secretary, in his or her sole discretion, determines are necessary to
avert or curtail the mass migration.

Subregulatory Matters

USCIS priorities/structural changes
1.
Ensure that focus is returned to vetting, base eligibility of applicants,
and fraud detection.
2. Realign the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS)
to ensure agencywide consistency on implementation of fraud detection
and vetting policies.
3. Review and repeal any internal agency memo that is inconsistent with
the priorities described in this chapter.

287(g) program. Issue a memo prohibiting any jurisdiction that applies
from being denied access to the program unless good cause is shown.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) priorities. Issue Department
Management Directive (and ICE companion Directive) to refocus HSI
on immigration offenses and criminal offenses typically associated with
immigration (for example, human trafficking). All criminal investigative
work without a clear nexus to the border or otherwise to Title 8 should be
turned over to the appropriate federal agency.

Blackie’s Warrants. ICE OPLA, ERO, and HSI should issue a joint internal
memo on operationalizing Blackie’s Warrants for immediate use on
worksite enforcement and other appropriate investigations and operations.
