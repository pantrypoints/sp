Here are the immediate steps to ensure that the State Department serve American citizens first:

Review Retroactively. Before inauguration, the President-elect’s department transition team should assess every aspect of State Department negotiations and funding commitments. Upon inauguration, the Secretary of State should order an immediate freeze on all efforts to implement unratified treaties and international agreements, allocation of resources, foreign assistance disbursements, domestic and international contracts and payments, hiring and recruiting decisions, etc., pending a political appointee-driven review to ensure that such efforts comport with the new Administration’s policies. The quality of this review is more import- ant than speed. The posture of the department during this review should be an unwavering desire to prioritize the American people—including a recognition that the federal government must be a diligent steward of taxpayer dollars. Implement Repair. The State Department must change its handling of international agreements to restore constitutional governance. Under prior Administrations, unnecessary institutional factors in the department caused numerous logistical challenges in negotiating, approving, and implementing treaties and agreements.

This is particularly true under the Biden Administration. For
example, under the Biden Administration, the State Department was considered
sufficiently unreliable in terms of alignment and effectiveness such that its political
leadership invoked its Circular 175 (C-175) authority to delegate its diplomatic
capacity to other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security.
At time of publication, the State Department is negotiating (or seeking to nego-
tiate) large-scale, sovereignty-eroding agreements that could come at considerable
economic and other costs to the American people. Although such agreements
should be evaluated and approved as are treaties, the Biden Administration is
likely to simply call them “agreements.” The Biden State Department not only
approves but also enforces treaties that have not been ratified by the U.S. Senate.
This practice must be thoroughly reviewed—and most likely jettisoned.
The next President should recalibrate how the State Department handles trea-
ties and agreements, primarily by restoring constitutionality to these processes.
He or she should direct the Secretary of State to freeze any ongoing treaty or inter-
national agreement negotiations and assess whether those efforts align with the
new President’s foreign policy direction. The next Administration should also
direct the secretary to order an immediate stand-down on enforcement of any
treaties that have not been ratified by the Senate, and order a thorough review of
the degree to which such enforcement has impacted the department’s functions,
policies, and use of resources.

The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Office of the Attorney General
and the White House Counsel’s Office, should also conduct a review to identify
“agreements” that are really treaty commitments within the ordinary public mean-
ing of the Constitution,6 and suspend compliance pending presidential transmittal
of those agreements to the Senate for advice and consent. The next Administration
should also move to withdraw from treaties that have been under Senate consider-
ation for 20 years or more, with the understanding that those treaties are unlikely
to be ratified. Under circumstances in which ratification of a stale treaty before
the Senate still serves national interests, the treaty letter of transmittal and sub-
mission should be updated for current circumstances. The Secretary of State must
revoke most outstanding C-175 authorities that have been granted to other agen-
cies during previous Administrations, although such revocations should be closely
coordinated with the White House for logistical reasons.

Coordinate with Other Agencies. Interagency engagement in this new
environment must be similarly adjusted to mirror presidential direction. Indeed,
coordination among federal agencies is challenging even in the most well-oiled
Administrations. Although such coordination is inescapable and sometimes produc-
tive, agencies tend to leverage each other’s resources in ways that occasionally have
off-mission consequences for the agency or agencies with the resources. Ideally, the﻿

Secretary of State should work as part of an agile foreign policy team along with the
National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, and other agency heads to flesh
out and advance the President’s foreign policy. Bureaucratic stovepipes of the past
should be less important than commitment to, and achievement of, the President’s
foreign policy agenda. The State Department’s role in these interagency discussions
must reflect the President’s clear direction and disallow resources and tools to be
used in any way that detracts from the presidentially directed mission.
Coordinate with Congress. Congress has both the statutory and appropri-
ations authority to impact the State Department’s operations and has a strong
interest in key aspects of American foreign policy. The department must therefore
take particular care in its interaction with Congress, since poor interactions with
Congress, regardless of intentions, could trigger congressional pushback or have
other negative impacts on the President’s agenda.

This will require particularly strong leadership of the Department of State’s
Bureau of Legislative Affairs. The Secretary of State and political leadership should
ensure full coordination with the White House regarding congressional engage-
ment on any State Department responsibility. This may lead to, for example, the
President authorizing the State Department to engage with Members of Congress
and relevant committees on certain issues (including statutorily designated con-
gressional consultations), but to remain “radio silent” on volatile or designated
issues on which the White House wants to be the primary or only voice. All such
authorized department engagements with Congress must be driven and handled
by political appointees in conjunction with career officials who have the relevant
expertise and are willing to work in concert with the President’s political appoin-
tees on particularly sensitive matters.

Respond Vigorously to the Chinese Threat. The State Department recently
opened the Office of China Coordination, or “China House.” This office is intended
to bring together experts inside and outside the State Department to coordinate
U.S. government relations with China “and advance our vision for an open, inclu-
sive international system.”7 Whether China House will streamline U.S. government
communication, consensus, and action on China policy—given the presence of
other agencies with strong competing or adverse interests—remains to be seen.
The unit is dependent on adequate and competent staff being assigned by other
bureaus within the State Department.

Nonetheless, the concept is one a Republican Administration should support
mutatis mutandis. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been “at war” with
the U.S. for decades. Now that this reality has been accepted throughout the gov-
ernment, the State Department must be prepared to lead the U.S. diplomatic effort
accordingly. The centralization of efforts in one place is critical to this end.
Review Immigration and Domestic Security Requirements. Arguably, the
department’s most noteworthy challenge on the global stage has been its handling of immigration and domestic security issues, which are inextricably related. The
State Department’s apparent posture toward these two issues, which are of paramount importance to the American people, has historically been that they are of
lesser importance than other issues and that they can be treated as concessions in
broader diplomatic engagements. In other instances in which access to the U.S. in
the form of immigrant (permanent) and nonimmigrant (temporary) visas could
potentially serve as diplomatic leverage, it is almost never used. To some degree,
the State Department and many of its personnel appear to view the U.S. immigra-
tion system less as a tool for strengthening the United States and more as a global
welfare program.

To ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of all Americans, this must change.
Below are several key areas in which the department’s formal and informal postures
must adjust to reflect the current immigration and domestic security environment:

Section 243(d) visa sanctions. Visa sanctions under section 243(d) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),8 enacted into law to motivate
countries to accept the return of any nationals who have been ordered
removed from the U.S., should be quickly and fully enforced. Recalcitrant
countries that do not accept receipt of their returned nationals will risk the
suspension of issuance of all immigrant visas, all nonimmigrant visas, or
all visas. These country-specific sanctions should remain in place until the
sanctioned country accepts the return of all its removal-pending nationals
and formally commits to future, regular acceptance of its nationals. Black-
letter implementation of this law will demonstrate a heretofore lacking
seriousness to the international community that other nations must respect
U.S. immigration laws and work with federal authorities to accept returning
nationals—or lose access to the United States.

Rightsizing refugee admissions. The Biden Administration has
engineered what is nothing short of a collapse of U.S. border security and Visa reciprocity. The United States should strictly enforce the doctrine
of reciprocity when issuing visas to all foreign nationals. For too long, the
U.S. has provided virtually unfettered access to foreign nationals from
countries that do not respond in kind—including countries that are actively
hostile to U.S. interests and nationals. Mandatory reciprocity will convey
the necessary reality that other countries do not have an unfettered right
to U.S. access and must reciprocally offer favorable visa-based access to U.S.
nationals. The State Department’s reaction time to other countries’ changes
in visa policies with respect to the U.S. must be streamlined to ensure it can
be updated in real time.

interior immigration enforcement. This Administration’s humanitarian
crisis—which is arguably the greatest humanitarian crisis in the modern
era, one which has harmed Americans and foreign nationals alike—will
take many years and billions of dollars to fully address. One casualty of the
Biden Administration’s behavior will be the current form of the U.S. Refugee
Admission Program (USRAP).

The federal government’s obligation to shift national security–essential
screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate
an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions. The
State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which
administers USRAP, must shift its resources to challenges stemming from
the current immigration situation until the crisis can be contained and
refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.

Strengthening bilateral and multilateral immigration-focused
agreements. Restoration of both domestic security and the integrity of
the U.S. immigration system should start with rapid reactivation of several
key initiatives in effect at the conclusion of the Trump Administration.
Reimplementation of the Remain in Mexico policy, safe third-country
agreements, and other measures to address the influx of non-Mexican
asylum applicants at the United States–Mexico border must be Day
One priorities. Although the State Department must rein in the C-175
authorities of other agencies, the Department of Homeland Security should
retain (or regain) C-175 authorities for negotiating bilateral and multilateral
security agreements.

Evaluation of national security–vulnerable visa programs. To protect
the American people, the State Department, in coordination with the White
House and other security-focused agencies, should evaluate several key
security-sensitive visa programs that it manages. Key programs include, but
should not be limited to, the Diversity Visa program, the F (student) visa
program, and J (exchange visitor) visa program. The State Department’s
evaluation must ensure that these programs are not only consistent with
White House immigration policy, but also align with its national security
obligations and resource limitations.
