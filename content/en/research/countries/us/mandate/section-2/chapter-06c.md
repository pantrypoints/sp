The following are our proposals for reorienting the U.S. government’s posture toward friends and adversaries alike.


### China

The designs the Chinese Communist Party are serious and dangerous.9 This tyrannical country with a population of more than 1 billion people has the vision, resources, and patience to achieve its objectives.

Protecting the United States from the PRC’s designs requires an unambiguous offensive-defensive mix, including protecting American citizens and their interests, as well as U.S. allies, from PRC attacks and abuse that undermine U.S. competitiveness, security, and prosperity. The United States must have a cost-imposing strategic response to make Beijing’s aggression unaffordable, even as the American economy and U.S. power grow.

This stance will require real, sustained, near-unprecedented U.S. growth; stronger partnerships; synchronized economic and security policies; and American energy independence—but above all, it will require a very honest perspective about the nature and designs of the PRC as more of a threat than a competitor.10

The next President should use the State Department and its array of resources to reassess and lead this effort, just as it did during the Cold War. The U.S. government needs an Article X for China,11 and it should be a presidential mandate. Along with the National Security Council, the State Department should draft an Article X, which should be a deeply philosophical look at the China challenge.

Many foreign policy professionals and national leaders, both in government and the private sector, are reluctant to take decisive action regarding China. Many are vested in an unshakable faith in the international system and global norms. They are so enamored with them they cannot brook any criticisms or reforms, let alone acknowledge their potential for being abused by the PRC. Others refuse to acknowledge Beijing’s malign activities and often pass off criticism as conspiracy theories.

For instance, many were quick to dismiss even the possibility that COVID-19
escaped from a Chinese research laboratory. The reality, however, is that the PRC’s
actions often do sound like conspiracy theories—because they are conspiracies. In
addition, some knowingly or not parrot the Communist line: Global leaders includ-
ing President Joe Biden, have tried to normalize or even laud Chinese behavior.
In some cases, these voices, like the global corporate giants BlackRock and Disney,
directly benefit from doing business with Beijing.

On the other hand, others acknowledge the dangers posed by the PRC, but
believe in a moderating approach to accommodate its rise, a policy of “compete
where we must, but cooperate where we can,” including on issues like climate
change. This strategy has demonstrably failed.

As with all global struggles with Communist and other tyrannical regimes, the
issue should never be with the Chinese people but with the Communist dictator-
ship that oppresses them and threatens the well-being of nations across the globe.12
That said, the nature of Chinese power today is the product of history, ideology,
and the institutions that have governed China during the course of five millennia,
inherited by the present Chinese leaders from the preceding generations of the
CCP.13 In short, the PRC challenge is rooted in China’s strategic culture and not
just the Marxism–Leninism of the CCP, meaning that internal culture and civil
society will never deliver a more normative nation. The PRC’s aggressive behavior
can only be curbed through external pressure.


### The Islamic Republic of Iran

The ongoing protests in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran), which are widely
viewed as a new revolution, have shown that the Islamic regime, which has been
in power since 1979 when Ayatollah Khomeini became the leader, is at its weakest
state in its history and is at odds not only with its own people but also its regional
neighbors. Iran is home to a proud and ancient culture, yet its people have strug-
gled to achieve democracy and have had to endure a hostile theocratic regime that
vehemently opposes freedom. The time may be right to press harder on the Iranian
theocracy, support the Iranian people, and take other steps to draw Iran into the
community of free and modern nations.

Unfortunately, the Obama and Biden Administrations have propped up the
brutal Islamist theocracy that has hurt the Iranian people and threatened nuclear
war. For example, the Obama Administration’s 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action, commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear deal, gave the Islamic regime a
crucial monetary lifeline after the Green Movement protests in 2009, which, while
ultimately unsuccessful, did succeed in weakening the regime and showing the
world that younger Iranians want freedom.

Instead of pressuring the Iranian theocracy to move toward democracy, the
Obama Administration threw the brutal regime an economic lifeline by giving
hundreds of billions of dollars to the Iranian government and providing other sanc-
tions relief. This economic relief did not moderate the regime, but emboldened its
brutality, its efforts to expand its nuclear weapons programs, and its support for
global terrorism. Former President Obama has admitted his lack of support for the
Green Movement during his Administration was an error and blamed it on poor
advisors—yet those same advisors are involved with the Biden Administration’s
insistence on reducing pressure on the theocracy and resurrecting a nuclear deal.

The next Administration should neither preserve nor repeat the mistakes of
the Obama and Biden Administrations. The correct future policy for Iran is one
that acknowledges that it is in U.S. national security interests, the Iranian people’s
human rights interests, and a broader global interest in peace and stability for the
Iranian people to have the democratic government they demand. This decision
to be free of the country’s abusive leaders must of course be made by the Iranian
people, but the United States can utilize its own and others’ economic and diplo-
matic tools to ease the path toward a free Iran and a renewed relationship with
the Iranian people.



### The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela

Once a model of democracy and a true U.S. ally, the Bolivarian Republic of Ven-
ezuela (Venezuela) has all but collapsed under the Communist regimes of the late
Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. In the 24 years since Hugo Chavez was first
elected Venezuelan president in 1999, the country has violently cracked down on
pro-democracy citizens and organizations, shattered its once oil-rich economy,
empowered domestic criminal cartels, and helped fuel a hemispheric refugee crisis.
Venezuela has swung from being one of the most prosperous, if not the most
prosperous, country in South America to being one of the poorest. Its Communist
leadership has also drawn closer to some of the United States’ greatest interna-
tional foes, including the PRC and Iran, which have long sought a foothold in the
Americas. Indeed, Venezuela serves as a reminder of just how fragile democratic
institutions that are not maintained can be. To contain Venezuela’s Communism
and aid international partners, the next Administration must take important steps
to put Venezuela’s Communist abusers on notice while making strides to help the
Venezuelan people. The next Administration must work to unite the hemisphere
against this significant but underestimated threat in the Southern Hemisphere.


### Russia

One school of conservative thought holds that as Moscow’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine drags on, Russia presents major challenges to U.S. interests, as well as to peace, stability, and the post-Cold War security order in Europe.

This viewpoint argues for continued U.S. involvement including military aid, economic aid, and the presence of NATO and U.S. troops if necessary. The end goal of the conflict must be the defeat of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a return to pre-invasion border lines. 

Another school of conservative thought denies that U.S. Ukrainian support is in the national security interest of America at all.

Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance and is one of the most corrupt nations in the region. European nations directly affected by the conflict should aid in the defense of Ukraine, but the U.S. should not continue its involvement. This viewpoint desires a swift end to the conflict through a negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia.

The tension between these competing positions has given rise to a third
approach. This conservative viewpoint eschews both isolationism and
interventionism. Rather, each foreign policy decision must first ask the
question: What is in the interest of the American people? U.S. military
engagement must clearly fall within U.S. interests; be fiscally responsible;
and protect American freedom, liberty, and sovereignty, all while recognizing
Communist China as the greatest threat to U.S. interests.

Thus, with respect to
Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military
aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a
clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.
Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine
is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland.
Furthermore, the conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and
provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.


The next conservative President has a generational opportunity to bring res-
olution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path
forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests
in the 21st century.


### The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

Peace and stability in Northeast Asia are vital interests of the United States. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Japan are critical allies for ensuring a free and open Indo–Pacific. They are indispensable military, economic, diplomatic, and technology partners. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) must be deterred from military conflict. The United States cannot permit the DPRK to remain a de facto nuclear power with the capacity to threaten the United States or its allies. This interest is both critical to the defense of the Amer- ican homeland and the future of global nonproliferation. The DPRK must not be permitted to profit from its blatant violations of international commitments or to threaten other nations with nuclear blackmail. Both interests can only be served if the U.S. disallows the DPRK’s rogue regime behavior.
