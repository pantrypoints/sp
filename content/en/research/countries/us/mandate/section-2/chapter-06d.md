### Western Hemisphere

The United States has a vested interest in a relatively united and economically
prosperous Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, the region now has an overwhelm-
ing number of socialist or progressive regimes, which are at odds with the freedom
and growth-oriented policies of the U.S. and other neighbors and who increasingly
pose hemispheric security threats. A new approach is therefore needed, one that
simultaneously allows the U.S. to re-posture in its best interests and helps regional
partners enter a new century of growth and opportunity.
The following core policies must be part of this new direction:

A “sovereign Mexico” policy. Mexico is currently a national security
disaster. Bluntly stated, Mexico can no longer qualify as a first-world nation;
it has functionally lost its sovereignty to muscular criminal cartels that
effectively run the country. The current dynamic is not good for either
U.S. citizens or Mexicans, and the perfect storm created by this cartel state
has negative effects that are damaging the entire hemisphere. The next
Administration must both adopt a posture that calls for a fully sovereign
Mexico and take all steps at its disposal to support that result in as rapid a
fashion as possible.

A fentanyl-free frontier. The same cartels that parasitically run Mexico
are also working with the PRC to fuel the largest drug crisis in the history
of North America. These Mexican cartels are working closely with Chinese
fentanyl precursor chemical manufacturers, importing those precursor
chemicals into Mexico, manufacturing fentanyl on Mexican soil, and
shipping it into the United States and elsewhere. The highly potent narcotic
is having an unprecedented lethal impact on the American citizenry. The
next Administration must leverage its new insistence on a sovereign Mexico
and work with other Western Hemisphere partners to halt the fentanyl
crisis and put a decisive end to this unprecedented public health threat.

A hemisphere-centered approach to industry and energy. The
next Administration has a golden opportunity to make key economic
changes that will not only provide tremendous economic opportunities
for Americans but will also serve as an economic boon to the entire
Western Hemisphere.

First, the United States must do everything possible, with both resources
and messaging, to shift global manufacturing and industry from more
distant points around the globe (especially from the increasingly hostile
and human rights-abusing PRC) to Central and South American countries.
“Re-hemisphering” manufacturing and industry closer to home will not only
eliminate some of the more recent supply-chain issues that damaged the U.S.
economy but will also represent a significant economic improvement for
parts of the Americas in need of growth and stabilization.

Similarly, the United States must work with Mexico, Canada, and other
countries to develop a hemisphere-focused energy policy that will reduce
reliance on distant and manipulable sources of fossil fuels, restore the free
flow of energy among the hemisphere’s largest producers, and work together
to increase energy production, including for nations that are looking for
dramatic economic expansion.

A “local” approach to security threats. Western Hemisphere nations,
including those in the Caribbean, arguably have stronger cultural and
historical ties to the United States than most other countries and regions
in the world. Yet Central and South America are moving rapidly into the
sphere of anti-American, external state actors, including the PRC, Iran, and
Russia. Specific countries in the Americas, such as Venezuela, Colombia,
Guyana, and Ecuador, are either increasingly regional security threats
in their own rights or are vulnerable to hostile extra-continental powers.
The U.S. has an opportunity to lead these democratic neighbors to fight
against the external pressure of threats from abroad and address local
regional security concerns. This leadership and collaboration must span all
tools at the disposal of U.S. allies and partners, including security-focused
cooperation.

Middle East and North Africa

The next Administration must re-engage with Middle Eastern and North Afri-
can nations and not abandon the region. Without U.S. leadership, the region may
tumble further into chaos or fall prey to American adversaries. This recommen-
dation requires a multi-dimensional strategy.

Second, the next Administration should build on the Trump
Administration’s diplomatic successes by encouraging other Arab states,
including Saudi Arabia, to enter the Abraham Accords. Related policies
should include reversing, as appropriate, the Biden Administration’s
degradation of the long-standing partnership with Saudi Arabia. The
Palestinian Authority should be defunded. A further key priority is keeping
Türkiye in the Western fold and a NATO ally. This includes a vigorous
outreach to Türkiye to dissuade it from “hedging” toward Russia or China,
which is likely to require a rethinking of U.S. support for YPG/PKK [People’s
Protection Units/Kurdistan Worker’s Party] Kurdish forces, which Ankara
believes are an existential threat to its security. For the foreseeable future—
and much longer than one new Administration—Middle Eastern oil will
play a key role in the world economy. Therefore, the U.S. must continue
to support its allies and compete with its economic adversaries, including
China. Relations with Saudi Arabia should be strengthened in a way that
seriously curtails Chinese influence in Riyadh.

Third, it is in the U.S. national interest to build a Middle East security
pact that includes Israel, Egypt, the Gulf states, and potentially India, as a
second “Quad” arrangement. Protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf
and in the Red Sea/Suez Canal is vital to the world economy and therefore
to U.S. prosperity as well. In North Africa, security cooperation with
European allies, especially France, will be vital to limit growing Islamist
threats and the incursion of Russian influence through positionings of the
Wagner Group.

The U.S. cannot neglect a concern for human rights and minority rights,
which must be balanced with strategic and security considerations. Special
attention must be paid to challenges of religious freedom, especially the
status of Middle Eastern Christians and other religious minorities, as well as
the human trafficking endemic to the region.

First, the U.S. must prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology and
delivery capabilities and more broadly block Iranian ambitions. This means,
inter alia, reinstituting and expanding Trump Administration sanctions;
providing security assistance for regional partners; supporting, through
public diplomacy and otherwise, freedom-seeking Iranian people in
their revolt against the mullahs; and ensuring Israel has both the military
means and the political support and flexibility to take what it deems to be
appropriate measures to defend itself against the Iranian regime and its
regional proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.


### Sub-Saharan Africa

Africa’s importance to U.S. foreign policy and strategic interests is rising and
will only continue to grow. Its explosive population growth, large reserves of
industry-dependent minerals, proximity to key maritime shipping routes, and its
collective diplomatic power ensure the continent’s global importance. Yet as Afri-
ca’s strategic significance has grown, the U.S.’s relative influence there has declined.
Terrorist activity on the continent has increased, while America’s competitors are
making significant gains for their own national interests. The PRC’s companies
dominate the African supply chain for certain minerals critical to emerging tech-
nologies. African nations comprise major country-bloc elements that shield the
PRC and Russia from international isolation for their human rights abuses—and
African nations staunchly support PRC foreign policy goals on issues such as Hong
Kong occupation, South China Seas dispute arbitration, and Taiwan.
The new Administration can correct this strategic failing of existing policy by
prioritizing Africa and by undertaking fundamental changes in how the United
States works with African nations.

At a bare minimum, the next Administration should:

Shift strategic focus from assistance to growth. Reorient the focus of
U.S. overseas development assistance away from stand-alone humanitarian
development aid and toward fostering free market systems in African
countries by incentivizing and facilitating U.S. private sector engagement
in these countries. Development aid alone does little to develop countries
and can fuel corruption and violent conflict. While the United States should
always be willing to offer emergency and humanitarian relief, both U.S. and
African long-term interests are better served by a free market-based, private
growth-focused strategy to Africa’s economic challenges.

Counter malign Chinese activity on the continent. This should include
the development of powerful public diplomacy efforts to counter Chinese
influence campaigns with commitments to freedom of speech and the free
flow of information; the creation of a template “digital hygiene” program
that African countries can access to sanitize and protect their sensitive
communications networks from espionage by the PRC and other hostile
actors; the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s
deteriorating position in Djibouti; and a focus on supporting American
companies involved in industries important to U.S. national interests or that
have a competitive advantage in Africa.

Counter the furtherance of terrorism. African country-based terrorist
groups like Boko Haram may currently lack the capability to attack the United States, but at least some of them would eventually try if allowed to
consolidate their operations and plan such attacks. The immediate threat
they pose lies in their abilities and willingness to strike American targets in
their regions of operation or to harm U.S. interests in other ways. The U.S.
should support capable African military and security operations through
the State Department and other federal agencies responsible for granting
foreign military education, training, and security assistance.

Build a coalition of the cooperative. Rather than thinning limited federal
resources by spreading funds across all countries (including some that are
unsupportive or even hostile to the United States,) the next Administration
should focus on those countries with which the U.S. can expect a mutually
beneficial relationship. After being designated focus countries by the
State Department, such nations should receive a full suite of American
engagement. That said, the next Administration should still maintain a
baseline level of contact even with those countries with which it has less-
than-fruitful relationships in order to encourage positive developments and
to be in position to seize unexpected diplomatic opportunities as they arise.


### Europe

American foreign policy has long benefited from cooperation with the countries
of Europe (generally, the EU), and any conservative Administration should build
on this resource. Yet the transatlantic relationship is complex, with security, trade,
and political dimensions.

First, the Europe, Eurasia, and Russia region is made up of relatively wealthy
and technologically advanced societies that should be expected to bear a fair share
of both security needs and global security architecture: The United States cannot
be expected to provide a defense umbrella for countries unwilling to contribute
appropriately. At stake after 2024 will be examining the status of the Wales Pledge
of 2 percent of gross domestic product toward defense by NATO members. The
new Administration will also want to encourage nations to exceed that pledge.
Second, transatlantic trade is a significant part of the global economy, and it is
in the U.S. national interest to amplify it, especially because this means weaning

Focus on core diplomatic activities, and stop promoting policies
birthed in the American culture wars. African nations are particularly
(and reasonably) non-receptive to the U.S. social policies such as abortion
and pro-LGBT initiatives being imposed on them. The United States should
focus on core security, economic, and human rights engagement with
African partners and reject the promotion of divisive policies that hurt the
deepening of shared goals between the U.S. and its African partners.

Europe of its dependence on China. However, there are also transatlantic trade
tensions that disturb the U.S.–EU relationship and that have been evident across
Administrations. The U.S. must undertake a comprehensive review of trade
arrangements between the EU and the United States to assure that U.S. businesses
are treated fairly and to build productive reciprocity. Outside the EU, trade with
the post-Brexit U.K. needs urgent development before London slips back into the
orbit of the EU.

Third, in the wake of Brexit, EU foreign policy now takes place without U.K.
input, which disadvantages the United States, given that the U.K. has historically
been aligned with many U.S. positions. Therefore, U.S. diplomacy must be more
attentive to inner-EU developments, while also developing new allies inside the
EU—especially the Central European countries on the eastern flank of the EU,
which are most vulnerable to Russian aggression.


### South and Central Asia

Many key American interests and responsibilities are found in South and
Central Asia. Specifically, continuing to advance the bilateral relationship with
India to mutual benefit is a crucial objective for U.S. policy. India plays a crucial
role in countering the Chinese threat and securing a free and open Indo–Pacific.
It is a critical security guarantor for the key routes of air and sea travel linking
East and West and an important emerging U.S. economic partner. For instance,
the 2019 Department of Defense Indo–Pacific Strategy Report noted that the
Indian Ocean area “is at the nexus of global trade and commerce, with nearly
half of the world’s 90,000 commercial vessels and two thirds of global oil trade
traveling through its sea lanes. The region boasts some of the fastest-growing
economies on Earth.”14

Meanwhile, the threat of transnational terrorism remains acute. The humiliat-
ing withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after a 20-year military campaign
has created new challenges. It has provided an opportunity to reset the deeply
troubled U.S.–Pakistan relationship and reassess U.S. counterterrorism strategy
in the region. The long-standing India–Pakistan rivalry and tensions regarding the
disputed territory of Kashmir continue to pose risks to regional stability, especially
because both countries are nuclear powers.

The State Department’s role in strengthening the regional security and eco-
nomic framework linking the U.S and India is crucial. In addition, the department
has important functional responsibilities in dealing with a range of threats from
nuclear proliferation to transnational proliferation. While American statecraft
should also seek to improve bilateral relations throughout the region, U.S. policy
must be clear-eyed and realistic about the perfidiousness of the Taliban regime in
Afghanistan and the military–political rule in Pakistan. There can be no expecta-
tion of normal relations with either.

The priority for statecraft is advancing the U.S.–Indian role as a cornerstone
of the Quad, a cooperative framework including the U.S., India, Japan, and Aus-
tralia. The Quad is comprised of the key nations in coordinating efforts for a free
and open Indo–Pacific. It is an overarching group that nests the key U.S. bilateral
and trilateral cooperative efforts that facilitate U.S. collaborative efforts across
the Indo–Pacific. The State Department should also encourage the “Quad-Plus”
concept that allows other regional powers to participate in Quad coordination on
issues of mutual interest. Further, the State Department must support an inte-
grated federal effort to deliver a revamped regional strategy for South Asia, as well
as leading the execution of key tasks to implement the strategy.15


### The Arctic

Because of Alaska, the U.S. is an Arctic nation. The Arctic is a vast expanse of
land and sea rich in resources including fish, minerals, and energy. For example,
the region is estimated to contain 90 million barrels of oil and one-quarter of the
world’s undiscovered natural gas reserves.16 The Arctic is lightly populated: Only
4 million people in the world live above the Arctic Circle, with more than half of
those living in Russia. Only around 68,000 people in Alaska live above the Arctic
Circle.17 However, the sheer immensity of the Alaskan Arctic means its population
density is less than one person per square mile.18

The United States has several strong interests in the Arctic region. The rate of
melting ice during summer months has led to increased interest not only from
shipping and tourism sectors, but also from America’s global competitors, who
are interested in exploiting the region’s strategic importance and accessing its
bounty of natural resources.

In the not-too-distant future, there will be a growing interest in the Arctic from
both state and non-state actors alike. China has been open about its interest in
the region, primarily as a highway for trade but also for its rich natural resources.
While the PRC’s increasing intervention in Arctic affairs is a bit strained because
it does not have an Arctic coastline, Russia does—and Russia has made no secret
of its view that the Arctic is vital for economic and military reasons. Russia has
invested heavily in new and refurbished Arctic bases and cold-weather equipment
and capabilities. The north star of U.S. Arctic policy should remain national sov-
ereignty, safeguarded through robust capabilities as well as through diplomatic,
economic, and legal attentiveness.

The next Administration should embrace the view that NATO must acknowl-
edge that it is, in part, an Arctic alliance. With the likely accession of Finland and
Sweden to NATO, every Arctic nation except for Russia will be a NATO member
state. NATO has been slow to appreciate that the Arctic is a theater that it must
defend, especially considering Russia’s brazen aggression against Ukraine. NATO
must develop and implement an Arctic strategy that recognizes the importance of﻿

the region and ensures that Russian use of Arctic waters and resources does not
exceed a reasonable footprint.

The U.S. should unapologetically pursue American interests in the Arctic by
promoting economic freedom in the region. Economic freedom spurs prosperity,
innovation, respect for the rule of law, jobs, and sustainability. Most important,
economic freedom can help to keep the Arctic stable and secure.
The U.S. should work to ensure that shipping lanes in the Arctic remain avail-
able to all global commercial traffic and free of onerous fees and burdensome
administrative, regulatory, and military requirements. While this should be the
next Administration’s policy with respect to all countries that might seek to block
free-flowing commercial traffic, the next Administration will clearly have to exert
substantial attention toward Russia.

Both the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy are vital tools to ensure an unmo-
nopolized Arctic. It is imperative that the Navy and Coast Guard continue to
expand their fleets, including planned icebreaker acquisitions, to assure Arctic
access for the United States and other friendly actors. The remote and harsh con-
ditions of the Arctic also make unmanned system investment and use particularly
appealing for providing additional situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance. The Coast Guard should also consider upgrading facilities,
such as its Barrow station, to reinforce its Arctic capabilities and demonstrate a
greater commitment to the region.

The People’s Republic of China has declared itself a “near-Arctic state,” which
is an imaginary term non-existent in international discourse. The United States
should work with like-minded Arctic nations, including Russia, to raise legitimate
concerns about the PRC’s so-called Polar Silk-Road ambitions.
Concerning Greenland, the opening of a U.S. consulate in Nuuk is welcome. A
formal year-round diplomatic presence is an effective way for the U.S. to better
understand local political and economic dynamics. Furthermore, given Green-
land’s geographic proximity and its rising potential as a commercial and tourist
location, the next Administration should pursue policies that enhance economic
ties between the U.S. and Greenland.
