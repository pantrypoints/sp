USAID installed advisers on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committees “in all its Bureaus, Offices, and [overseas] Missions” and created “an agency-wide dashboard and DEI scorecard for all bureaus, offices, and missions” to track staff compliance with the Adminis- tration’s DEI directives. A Chief DEI Officer oversees this DEI infrastructure and sits in the Administrator’s office. DEI directives are now part of all agency policies and are incorporated as standard clauses in all contract and grant awards. Those seeking to do business with the agency must “describe the approaches they will use to diversify their partner base.”8 USAID often ties DEI to “gender and climate equity,” corrupting every aspect of the agency’s overseas work.

The upshot has been to racialize the agency and create a hostile work environ- ment for anyone who disagrees with the Biden Administration’s identity politics. This pursuit of ideological purity threatens merit-based professional advancement for staff who do not overtly conform, hyperpoliticizes what should be a nonpartisan federal workplace environment, creates an institutionalized cadre of progressive political commissars, corrupts the award process, and discourages potential con- tractors and grantees that disagree with this radical agenda from applying for USAID funding.

The next conservative Administration should dismantle USAID’s DEI apparatus
by eliminating the Chief Diversity Officer position along with the DEI advisers and
committees; cancel the DEI scorecard and dashboard; remove DEI requirements
from contract and grant tenders and awards; issue a directive to cease promotion
of the DEI agenda, including the bullying LGBTQ+ agenda; and provide staff a
confidential medium through which to adjudicate cases of political retaliation
that agency or implementing staff suffered during the Biden Administration. It
should eliminate funding for partners that promote discriminatory DEI practices
and consider debarment in egregious cases.

As federal departments and agencies cannot play partisan politics, staff—irre-
spective of hiring mechanism—as well as implementers and grantees that engage
in ideological agitation on behalf of the DEI agenda should be dismissed, and enti-
ties should be debarred. The next conservative Administration should return the
authority over all civil rights issues at USAID to the agency’s Office of Civil Rights,
which is the appropriate locus for ensuring that all Americans have guaranteed
equality of career opportunity at USAID.

Refocusing Gender Equality on Women, Children, and Families. Instead
of protecting women’s and children’s unalienable human rights and propelling
their ability to thrive in society, past Democrat Administrations have nearly erased what females are and what femininity is through “gender” policies and practices.
For instance, these Administrations have diluted USAID’s focus on assisting vulnerable women, children, and families around the globe by adding protections for
and ideological advocacy on behalf of progressive special-interest groups. USAID
now aggressively promotes abortion on demand under the guise of “sexual and
reproductive health and reproductive rights,” “gender equality,” and “women’s
empowerment” and advocates for those who claim minority status or vulnerability.
Families are the basic unit of and foundation for a thriving society.

Without women, there are no children, and society cannot continue. As evidenced by the confirmation testimony of now-Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the progressive Left has so misused and altered the definition of what a “woman” is that one of our U.S. Supreme Court Justices was unable to delineate clearly the fundamental biological and sexual traits that define the group of which she is a part. USAID cannot advocate for and protect women when they have been erased globally along with the values and traditional structures that have supported them. The next conservative Administration should rename the USAID Office of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE) as the USAID Office of Women, Children, and Families; refocus and realign resources that currently support programs in GEWE to the Office of Women, Children, and Families; redes- ignate the Senior Gender Coordinator as an unapologetically pro-life politically appointed Senior Coordinator of the Office of Women, Children, and Families; and eliminate the “more than 180 gender advisors and points of contact...embedded in Missions and Operating Units throughout the Agency.”9

In addition, the next conservative Administration should rescind President
Biden’s 2022 Gender Policy and refocus it on Women, Children, and Families
and revise the agency’s regulation on “Integrating Gender Equality and Female
Empowerment in USAID’s Program Cycle.”10 It should remove all references, exam-
ples, definitions, photos, and language on USAID websites, in agency publications
and policies, and in all agency contracts and grants that include the following
terms: “gender,” “gender equality,” “gender equity,” “gender diverse individu-
als,” “gender aware,” “gender sensitive,” etc. It should also remove references to
“abortion,” “reproductive health,” and “sexual and reproductive rights” and con-
troversial sexual education materials.

In the past, the word “gender” was a polite alternative to the word “sex” or term
“biological sex.” The Left has commandeered the term “gender,” which used to
mean either “male” or “female,” to include a spectrum of others who are seeking to
alter biological and societal sexual norms. The promotion of gender radicalism is
anathema to the traditional norms of many societies where USAID works, causes
resentment by tying lifesaving assistance to rejecting the aid recipient’s own firmly
held fundamental values regarding sexuality, and produces unnecessary conster-
nation and confusion among and even outright bias against men.﻿

The next Administration should ensure that USAID’s goal in service of its
mission is to help protect and propel all members of society—women, children,
and men—from conception to natural death. To do so, USAID’s Office of Women,
Children, and Families should strive to ensure that communities have their basic
human needs, without which they will be unable to thrive, met first and foremost.
Basic human needs include equal and safe access to potable water, sanitation, food,
education, health care, houses of worship, justice, pregnancy and family resource
centers, working capital, electricity, technology, and business opportunities. The
Office of Women, Children, and Families should implement the Geneva Consen-
sus Declaration on Women’s Health and Protection of the Family and prioritize
partnerships with local organizations, including faith-based organizations (FBOs).
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance. Protecting life should be among the
core objectives of United States foreign assistance. Shortly after taking office, how-
ever, President Biden issued a memorandum that reversed a myriad of pro-life
policies and revoked the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA)
policy, widely known as the Mexico City Policy. Biden also restored funding to
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which supports and implements
China’s coercive abortion and sterilization regimen.

PLGHA requires foreign NGOs, as a condition of receiving assistance, to agree
not to perform or actively promote abortions as a method of family planning in
foreign countries. Previous pro-life Presidents beginning with Ronald Reagan
applied these conditions to family planning assistance, but President Trump for
the first time expanded the Mexico City Policy to protect “global health assistance
furnished by all departments or agencies” (estimated to be $8.8 billion annually).
The Biden Administration restored abortion subsidies to pro-abortion NGOs
including Planned Parenthood International and MSI Reproductive Choices. In
reversing PLGHA, Biden declared a radical assault on the policy of protecting life,
choosing instead to promote abortion on demand around the world under the
guise of “sexual and reproductive health and rights.” USAID’s priority of funding
the global abortion industry negates programs that promote life, women’s health,
and the family.

Even under PLGHA, several loopholes allowed support for the global abortion
industry to continue. International NGOs that perform and promote abortions
overseas like Population Services International, Pathfinder, PATH, the Population
Council, EngenderHealth, and WomanCare Global International continued to
receive funding from USAID under PLGHA and now, under Biden, receive tens
of millions more in U.S. taxpayer dollars in foreign assistance annually without
any oversight. When the United Nations Secretariat promoted abortion and abor-
tion-inducing drugs under the umbrella of “sexual and reproductive health” as
an element of its COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan in May 2020,
the exemptions in PLGHA for humanitarian aid and multilateral organizations illuminated another loophole in the policy’s effectiveness in safeguarding U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to promote abortion.

Pro-abortion groups also have received funds under other categories of foreign
aid that fall outside the scope of global health assistance, including women-related
and economic assistance programs. Members of Congress have advocated closing
these loopholes by extending PLGHA to all foreign assistance through the Protect-
ing Life in Foreign Assistance Act, sponsored by Senator Mike Lee (R–UT) and
Representative Virginia Foxx (R–NC).11 Current law in the Foreign Assistance Act
gives the President broad authority to set “such terms and conditions as he may
determine” on foreign assistance, which legally empowers the next conservative
President to expand this pro-life policy.

To stop U.S. foreign aid from supporting the global abortion industry, the next
conservative Administration should issue an executive order that, at a minimum,
reinstates PLGHA and summarily blocks funding to UNFPA but also closes loop-
holes by applying the policy to all foreign assistance, including humanitarian aid,
and improving its enforcement. The executive order to reinstate PLGHA should
be drafted broadly to apply to all foreign assistance. It should simultaneously
rescind President Biden’s memorandum entitled “Protecting Women’s Health at
Home and Abroad,” issued on January 28, 2021.12 The new pro-life executive order
should apply to foreign NGOs, including subgrantees and subcontractors, and
remove exemptions for U.S.-based NGOs, public international organizations, and
bilateral government-to-government agreements. All entities funded by USAID,
both directly and indirectly, should report their compliance with the PLGHA, and
USAID should institute penalties, including debarment from future federal funding,
for violations of it. The new executive order also should instruct the Administrator
of USAID to publish reports on implementation of the PLGHA by both prime and
sub-prime recipients.

In addition, the Helms Amendment should continue to be applied, as it has been
by both Republican and Democratic Administrations for more than 50 years, as a
complete ban on the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions abroad.
International Religious Freedom. Conservatives believe international
religious freedom is central to USAID’s development efforts. President Trump’s
Executive Order 13926 on “Advancing International Religious Freedom”13
instructed the Secretary of State, in consultation with the USAID Administrator,
to budget at least $50 million a year for programs that advance international reli-
gious freedom and “ensure that faith-based and religious entities, including eligible
entities in foreign countries, are not discriminated against on the basis of religious
identity or religious belief when competing for Federal funding.”
Under the Trump Administration, the agency set up a senior-level Chief Adviser
for International Religious Freedom who reported directly to the Administrator with the task of coordinating a “whole-of-USAID” approach to achieving this priority. It created a robust genocide-response capability. USAID affirmed the
agency’s partnerships with faith-based organizations through its rule on “Participation by Religious Organizations in USAID Programs;”14 “Partnership Guidance and Answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Faith Based Organizations;”
and “Legal Guidance and Answers to FAQs for USAID Staff.”

Today, USAID officials and their progressive partners have resisted efforts to
promote religious freedom, especially as it relates to abortion and gender ideology,
which are anathema to the traditional societies where USAID funds programs (in
addition to many U.S. taxpayers). U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated
his predecessor’s focus on religious freedom.

The next conservative Administration must champion the core American value
of religious freedom, which correlates significantly with poverty reduction, eco-
nomic growth, and peace. It should train all USAID staff on the connection between
religious freedom and development; integrate it into all of the agency’s programs,
including the five-year Country Development and Coordination Strategies due
for updates in 2025; strengthen the missions’ relationships with local faith-based
leaders; and build on local programs that are serving the poor. Congress should
appropriate funding to USAID specifically to support persecuted religious minori-
ties in line with Executive Order 13926.
