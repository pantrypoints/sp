### Latin America

U.S. foreign assistance throughout the Western Hemisphere is designed to respond to national security threats that emanate from the region, such as illicit drug and arms trafficking; illegal immigration flows; terrorism; pandemics; and strategic threats from China, Russia, and Iran. Over the past decade, the United States has provided billions of dollars in security, humani- tarian, and development assistance in Central America and the Andes, including $1 billion in food and non-food emergency aid to millions of Venezuelan refu- gees who have fled the Maduro dictatorship. USAID is always first to respond to natural disasters in Central America and the Caribbean and employs a network of dedicated experts in the region to deliver this assistance. During the COVID pandemic, the United States provided millions of doses of vaccines and other emergency health support.

Yet years of foreign aid have failed to bring peace, prosperity, and stability to
the hemisphere. Poverty, joblessness, and social unrest have led to leftist electoral
victories from Mexico to Chile. These regimes are hostile to American interests and
private enterprise, breed corruption, implement radical policies that will further
impoverish their people and threaten their democracies, and are more open to
striking partnerships with Communist China. 

Left-wing authoritarian kleptocracies in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela deny their people basic freedoms, violently
and ruthlessly suppress any dissent, repress communities of faith, and generate
such misery that hundreds of thousands of their citizens have attempted to cross
our southern border over the past two years. No recent Administration has made
any progress in reducing the chaos and desperation in Haiti.

Conversely, Latin America is a major global source of energy and food, which
generates substantial income that can finance internal social and economic devel-
opment. The nations of the hemisphere share a natural and massive geographic
trade and investment advantage through their proximity to the United States,
supplemented by free-trade agreements. The United States remains the favored
destination for higher education and business opportunities for Latin Americans.
Successful diasporas in the United States serve as powerful economic, cultural,
and political bridges to every country in the region.

The Trump Administration focused on promoting trade and investment,
especially in infrastructure, through an interagency effort called América Crece
(America Grows), by which USAID played a key role in providing technical
assistance to create a more enabling environment to attract private investment.
The Biden Administration canceled the program.
The next conservative Administration should reassess all programs of U.S. for-
eign aid to Latin America and terminate those that have failed to achieve results
after years of effort. Instead, USAID should:

Focus its resources on strengthening the fundamentals of free markets, such
as clear property rights and a functioning judiciary, and on promoting labor
and pension reforms, lower taxes, and deregulation in order to increase
trade and investment within the region and with the United States as the
genuine path to economic and political stability.
Challenge the socialist ideas that have captured too many of the region’s
governments and their nations’ youth.
Fund partnerships with the private sector and support civil-society groups,
including university centers and think tanks that advocate for pro–free
market and democratic ideas.

Finally, Latin America is the perfect proving ground for reducing USAID’s reli-
ance on large U.S.-based implementers, and the agency should commit to shifting
all of its portfolio in the region to local organizations by 2030.


### PERSONNEL

The Trump Administration agenda for USAID was undercut from the outset
both by recalcitrant career personnel and by inexperienced political personnel.
The next conservative Administration should implement personnel policies from
the beginning so that the agency can be effectively managed according to high stan-
dards. The rapid deployment of reforms will require key experienced personnel
installed quickly at USAID’s headquarters and missions. Delay will only impede
progress. In general, areas of focus should be appointing effective lawyers in key
positions, reforming career hiring/firing mechanisms, and getting a grip on the
grantmaking process.

The Administration should staff the Office of the General Counsel with at least
four politically appointed attorneys (besides the General Counsel). The General
Counsel should have two political deputies, one of whom should cover Human
Capital and Talent Management (HCTM) and the other the Office of Acquisition
and Assistance (OAA).

The Administration should name a political appointee with long experience in
federal personnel systems as USAID’s Chief Human Capital Officer and Director
of HCTM. This appointee would help to scope and shepherd position descriptions,
— 278 —Agency for International Development
clearances, and other components of the hiring process that are necessary for
immediate onboarding while coordinating with the White House to bring in new
appointees and make internal career employee changes. On Day One, USAID
should halt all agencywide training and replace it with training modules to advance
the President’s agenda.

The Administration should appoint a Senior Accountable Official (SAO) to
report on the agency’s adherence to Administration policy priorities, including on
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance, critical race theory, climate change, gender,
and diversity and inclusion. It should also create a program to staff hard-to-fill
positions overseas.

Finally, the Administration should create a recruiting program for veterans
and other groups to participate in career job opportunities at USAID. Former mis-
sionaries, veterans, members of diasporas, and faith community stakeholders with
overseas experience should be recruited to work at USAID on Schedule A appoint-
ments, as Institutional Services Contractors, as Personal Services Contractors, and
as Foreign Service Officers.


### CONCLUSION

The next conservative Administration will have a unique opportunity to realign
U.S. foreign assistance with American national interests and the principles of good
governance and more accurately reflect the U.S. taxpayer’s unmatched charita-
ble desire to help those in need. It can build on a strong baseline of conservative
reforms undertaken by the Trump Administration to counter Communist China’s
strategy of world domination. However, this will require that bold steps are taken
on Day One to undo the gross misuse of foreign aid by the current Administration
to promote a radical ideology that is politically divisive at home and harms our
global standing.
