## MISSION STATEMENT

The current mission statement as stated by the Biden Administration highlights
the broad scope of the USDA:
To serve all Americans by providing effective, innovative, science-based
public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource

American farmers efficiently and safely produce food to meet the needs of individuals around the globe. Because of the innovation and resilience of the nation’s farmers, American agriculture is a model for the world. 

If farmers are allowed to operate without unnecessary government intervention,
American agriculture will continue to flourish, producing plentiful, safe, nutritious,
and affordable food.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) can and should play a limited role,
with much of its focus on removing governmental barriers that hinder food pro-
duction or otherwise undermine efforts to meet consumer demand. The USDA
should recognize what should be self-evident: Agricultural production should first
and foremost be focused on efficiently producing safe food.
This chapter provides important background on the USDA and identifies many
of the USDA-specific issues that will be faced by an incoming Administration. It
provides specific recommendations for the next Administration about how to
address these issues and lays out a conservative vision for what the USDA should
look like in the future.
protection and management, rural development, and related issues with a
commitment to delivering equitable and climate smart opportunities that
inspire and help America thrive.1

The first part of the mission statement regarding the issues covered is not new
to the Biden Administration; it reflects the overly broad nature of the USDA’s work.
However, the language bringing in equity and climate change is new to the Biden
Administration and part of the USDA’s express effort to transform agricultural
production.2

The USDA’s new vision statement illuminates the focus of this effort:

An equitable and climate smart food and agriculture economy that protects and
improves the health, nutrition and quality of life of all Americans, yields healthy
land, forests and clean water, helps rural America thrive, and feeds the world.3
This effort is one of a federal central plan to put climate change and envi-
ronmental issues ahead of the most important requirements of agriculture—to
efficiently produce safe food. The USDA would apparently use its power to change
the very nature of the food and agriculture economy into one that is “equitable and
climate smart.” As an initial matter, the USDA should not try to control and shape
the economy, but should instead remove obstacles that hinder food production.
Further, it should not place ancillary issues, such as environmental issues, ahead
of agricultural production itself.

A Proper Mission Statement. Even before the Biden Administration’s rad-
ical effort to reshape the USDA’s work, the USDA’s mission was and is too broad,
including serving as a major welfare agency through implementation of programs
such as food stamps. This far-reaching mission is not the fault of the USDA, but of
Congress, which has given the department its extensive power.

Congress must limit the USDA’s role. A proper mission would clarify that the
department’s primary focus is on agriculture and that the USDA serves all Amer-
icans. The USDA’s “client” is the American people in general, not a subset of
interests, such as farmers, meatpackers, environmental groups, etc.

Within this agricultural focus, the USDA should develop and disseminate information and research (the historical role of the USDA); identify and address concrete threats to public health and safety arising directly from food and agri- culture; remove unjustified foreign trade barriers blocking market access for American agricultural goods; and generally remove government barriers that undermine access to safe and affordable food across the food supply chain. Core principles should be included within any mission statement, including a recognition that farmers, and the food system in general, should be free from unnecessary government intervention. Further, there should be clear statements about the importance of sound science to inform the USDA’s work and respect for personal freedom and individual dietary choices, private property rights, and the rule of law.

Taking these factors into account, below is a model USDA mission statement: To develop and disseminate agricultural information and research, identify and address concrete public health and safety threats directly connected to food and agriculture, and remove both unjustified foreign trade barriers for U.S. goods and domestic government barriers that undermine access to safe and affordable food absent a compelling need—all based on the importance of sound science, personal freedom, private property, the rule of law, and service to all Americans.


## OVERVIEW: MAJOR PRIORITY ISSUES AND SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln created the USDA.4 It had a very narrow mission focused on the dissemination of information connected to agriculture and “to procure, propagate and distribute among the people new valuable seeds and plants.”5 

During the last 160 years, the scope of the USDA’s work has expanded well beyond that narrow mis- sion—and well beyond agriculture itself. In addition to being a distributor of farm subsidies, the USDA runs the food stamp program and other food-related wel- fare programs and covers issues including conservation, biofuels, forestry, and rural programs.

Based on the USDA’s fiscal year (FY) 2023 budget summary, outlays are esti- mated at $261 billion: $221 billion for mandatory programs and $39 billion for discretionary programs.6 These outlays are broken down as follows: nutrition assis- tance (70 percent); farm, conservation, and commodity programs (14 percent); “all other,” which includes rural development, research, food safety, marketing and regulatory, and departmental management (11 percent); and forestry (5 percent).7 The USDA has provided a summary of its size, explaining, “Today, USDA is com- prised of 29 agencies organized under eight Mission Areas and 16 Staff Offices, with nearly 100,000 employees serving the American people at more than 6,000 locations across the country and abroad.”8

For an incoming Administration, there are numerous issues that should be
addressed at the USDA. This chapter identifies and discusses many of the most
important issues. The initial issues discussed should be priority issues for the next
Administration:


### Defend American Agriculture

The USDA, alongside Biden–Harris Administration is transforming the food system from farm to fork, and at every stage along the supply chain.10

The federal government does not need to transform the food system or develop a national plan to intervene across the supply chain. Instead, it should respect American farmers, truckers, and everyone who makes the food supply chain so resilient and successful. One of the important lessons learned during the COVID- 19 pandemic was how critical it is to remove barriers in the food supply chain—not to increase them.

The Biden Administration’s centrally planned transformational effort mini- mizes the importance of efficient agricultural production and instead places issues such as climate change and equity front and center. The USDA’s Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2022–2026 identifies six strategic goals, the first three of which focus on issues such as climate change, renewable energy, and systemic racism. In the Secretary of Agriculture’s message, there is only one mention of affordable food— and nothing about efficient production and the incredible innovation and respect for the environment that already exists within the agricultural community.11 The Biden Administration’s USDA strongly supported12 the recent United Nations (U.N.) Food Systems Summit. According to the USDA:

The stated goal of the Food Systems Summit was to transform the way the
world produces, consumes and thinks about foods within the context of the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to meet the challenges of
poverty, food security, malnutrition, population growth, climate change, and
natural resource degradation.13

Not unlike those who oppose reliable and affordable energy production, there
is a disdain, especially by some on the Left, for American agriculture and the food
system.14 The Biden Administration’s vision of a federal government developing
a plan that “fixes” agriculture and focuses on issues secondary to food production
is very disturbing.

A recent USDA-created program captures both the disrespect for American
farmers and the Biden Administration’s effort to dictate agricultural practices.
The USDA explained that it was concerned with farmers not transitioning to
organic farming, and therefore announced that it will dedicate $300 million to induce farmers to adopt organic farming.15 There was no recognition that farmers
know how to farm better than D.C. politicians16 or a that organic food is expensive17
and land-intensive.18 The Biden Administration has also been pushing so-called
“climate-smart”19 agricultural practices which received additional support in the
partisan Inflation Reduction Act.20

American agriculture should not need defending. According to the USDA’s latest
data, farm output nearly tripled (a 175 percent increase) from 1948 to 2019, while
the amount of land farmed decreased. In fact, as farm output increased by 175
percent, all agricultural inputs increased by only 4 percent.21

In 2021, despite high food prices—a major problem and regressive—American consumers spent an average of about 10 percent of their personal disposable income on food, which is close to historic lows. For decades, this share has been in
decline.22 America’s farmers efficiently produce food using fewer resources, making
it possible for food to be affordable. This reality is not only something that should
be defended but also touted as a prime example of what makes American agricul-
ture so successful. The connection between efficiency and affordability seems lost
in the Biden Administration’s effort to transform the food system.
