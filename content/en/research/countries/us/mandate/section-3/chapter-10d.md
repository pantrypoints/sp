On average, taxpayers cover about 60 percent47 of the premium cost for policies
purchased in the federal crop insurance program. One of the most widely
supported and bipartisan policy reforms is to reduce the premium subsidy
that taxpayers are forced to pay.48 At a minimum, taxpayers should not pay
more than 50 percent of the premium. After all, taxpayers should not have
to pay more than the farmers who benefit from the crop insurance policies.

must demand a genuine reform process and express unwavering support
for a USDA that shapes a safety net that considers the interests of farmers,
while also remembering the interests of taxpayers and consumers. Any
safety net for farmers should be a true safety net—one that helps farmers
when they have experienced serious unforeseen losses (preferably when
there has been a disaster or unforeseen natural event causing damage) and
that exists to help them in unusual situations.

Separate the agricultural provisions of the farm bill from the
nutrition provisions. To have genuine reform and proper consideration
of the issues, agricultural programs should be considered in separate
legislation distinct from food stamps and the nutrition part of the farm bill,
and reauthorization of such programs should be fixed on different timelines
to ensure this separation. Agricultural and nutritional programs, which are
distinct from each other, have been combined together for political reasons,
something which is readily admitted by proponents of this logrolling. When
it comes to American agriculture and welfare programs, they deserve sound
policy debates, not political tactics at the expense of thoughtful discourse.
Move the Work of the Food and Nutrition Service. 

The USDA implements 
many means-tested federal support programs, including the largest food assis-
tance program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known
as food stamps), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC) Food Program. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
oversees these programs and other food and nutrition programs, including the
Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion,52 which handles the USDA’s work on
the “Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (Dietary Guidelines).53 Food nutrition
programs include: SNAP; WIC; the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); the
School Breakfast Program (SBP); the Child and Adult Care Food Program; the
Nutrition Program for the Elderly; Nutrition Service Incentives; the Summer Food
Service Program; the Commodity Supplemental Food Program; the Temporary
Emergency Food Program; the Farmer’s Market Nutrition Program; and the Spe-
cial Milk Program.

The next Administration should:

Move the USDA food and nutrition programs to the Department of
Health and Human Services. There are more than 89 current means-
tested welfare programs, and total means-tested spending has been
estimated to surpass $1.2 trillion between federal and state resources.54
Because means-tested federal programs are siloed and administered in
separate agencies, the effectiveness and size of the welfare state remains largely hidden. There are means-tested food-support programs in the USDA (specially FNS), whereas most means-tested programs are at the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All means-tested anti-poverty programs should be overseen by one department—specifically HHS,
which handles most welfare programs.

Reform SNAP. Ostensibly, SNAP sends money through electronic-bene-
fit-transfer (EBT) cards to help “low-income” individuals buy food. It is the largest
of the federal nutrition programs. Food stamps are designed to be supplemented by
other forms of income—whether through paid employment or nonprofit support.
SNAP serves 41.1 million individuals—an increase of 4.3 million people during the
Biden years.55 In 2020, the food stamp program cost $79.1 billion. That number
continued to rise—by 2022, outlays hit $119.5 billion.56

The next Administration should:

Re-implement work requirements. The statutory language covering
food stamps allows states to waive work requirements that otherwise
apply to work-capable individuals—that is, adult beneficiaries between the
ages 18 and 50 who are not disabled and do not have any children or other
dependents in the home.57

Even in a strong economy, work expectations are fairly limited: Individuals
who are work-capable and without dependents are required to work or
prepare for work for 20 hours per week.58 The work requirements are then
implemented unless the state requests a waiver from the USDA’s Food and
Nutrition Services.59 Waivers from statutory work requirements can be
approved in two instances: an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent
or a lack of sufficient jobs.60

The Trump Administration bolstered USDA work expectations in the
food stamp program. In February 2019, FNS issued a modest regulatory
change that applied only to able-bodied individuals without dependents—
beneficiaries aged 18 to 49, not elderly or disabled, who did not have children
or other dependents in the home (ABAWD).61 The FNS rule changed
when a state could receive a waiver from implementing the ABAWD work
requirement.

Under the new rule, in order to waive the work requirement, the state’s
unemployment rate had to be above 6 percent for more than 24 months.
The rule also defined “area” in such a way that states would be unable to
combine non-contiguous counties in order to maximize their waivers.62 Of

the more than 40 million food stamp beneficiaries, the Trump rule would
have applied only to 688,000 individuals in fiscal year 2021.63
The Trump reform was scheduled to go into effect, but a D.C. district court
federal judge enjoined the rule.64 The USDA filed an appeal in late December
2020,65 but the Biden Administration withdrew from defending the
challenge, and the rule was never implemented.66

Beyond the able-bodied work requirement, FNS should implement better
regulation to clarify options for states to implement the general work
requirement. This requirement is an option states can apply to work-
capable beneficiaries aged 16 to 59. If beneficiaries’ work hours are below
30 hours a week, states can implement the general work requirements to
oblige beneficiaries to register for work or participate in SNAP Employment
and Training or workfare assigned by the state SNAP agency.67 Increased
clarity for states would include items like states being required to offer
employment and training spots for those that request them—not simply
budgeting for every currently enrolled able-bodied adult.


Reform broad-based categorical eligibility. Federal law permits states
to enroll individuals in food stamps if they receive a benefit from another
program, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
program. However, under an administrative option in TANF called broad-
based categorical eligibility (BBCE), ”benefit” is defined so broadly that it
includes simply receiving distributed pamphlets and 1–800 numbers.68 This
definition, with its low threshold to trigger a “benefit,” allows individuals to
bypass eligibility limits—particularly the asset requirement (how much the
applicant has in resources, such as bank accounts or property).69 Adopting
the BBCE option has even allowed millionaires to enroll in the food
stamp program.70

The Trump Administration proposed to close the loophole with a rule
to “increase program integrity and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse.”71 The
regulation was not finalized before the end of the Trump Administration.

Re-evaluate the Thrifty Food Plan. In a dramatic overreach, the Biden
Administration unilaterally increased food stamp benefits by at least 23
percent in October 2021.72 Through an update to the Thrifty Food Plan, in
which the USDA analyzes a basket of foods intended to provide a nutritious
diet, the USDA increased food stamp outlays by between $250 billion and
$300 billion over 10 years.73

Although the 2018 farm bill instructed FNS to update the Thrifty Food Plan
by 2023 and every five years thereafter, every previous Thrifty Food Plan
has been always cost-neutral ( just an inflation update)—exactly what CBO
estimated as cost of the 2018 farm bill.74

The Biden Administration may have skirted regulations and congressional
authority to increase the overall cost of the program. In fact, Senate and
House Republicans requested that the Government Accountability Office
investigate the legal authorities and process that the USDA undertook to
arrive at such an unprecedented increase.75

Eliminate the heat-and-eat loophole. States can artificially boost a
household’s food stamp benefit by using the heat-and-eat loophole. The
amount of food stamps a household receives is based on its “countable”
income (income minus certain deductions). Households that receive
benefits from the Low-Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP) are eligible for a larger utility deduction. In order to make
households eligible for the higher deduction, and thus for greater food
stamp benefits, states have distributed LIHEAP checks for amounts as small
as $1 to food stamp recipients.

The 2014 farm bill tightened this loophole by requiring that a household must
receive more than $20 annually in LIHEAP payments to be eligible for the larger
utility deduction and subsequently higher food stamp benefits.76 Nonetheless,
states continue to inflate their standard utility allowances. Under the Trump
Administration, the USDA proposed a rule, which was not finalized, that would
have standardized the utility allowance.77
Reform WIC. Turning to WIC, this program distributes money through EBT
cards to help low-income women, infants, and children under six purchase nutri-
tion-rich foods and nutrition education (including breastfeeding support). As of
August 2022, approximately 6.3 million people participated in WIC each month
to purchase food.78 In 2021, WIC federal outlays were $5 billion.79
The next Administration should:

Reform the state voucher system. State agencies control WIC costs
by approving only one brand of infant formula through competitive
bidding for infant formula rebate contracts. Because 50 percent of baby
formula is purchased through the federal WIC program, it is vital that
regulation for these competitive bidding contracts does not unintentionally
create monopolies.

Re-evaluate excessive regulation. As for baby formula regulations
generally, labeling regulations and regulations that unnecessarily delay the
manufacture and sale of baby formula should be re-evaluated.80 During the
Biden Administration, there have been devastating baby formula shortages.
