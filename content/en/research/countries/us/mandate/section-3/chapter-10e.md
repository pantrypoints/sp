Federal meal programs for K–12 students were created to provide food to children from low-income families while at school.81 Today, however, federal school meals increasingly resemble enti- tlement programs that have strayed far from their original objective and represent an example of the ever-expanding federal footprint in local school operations. 

The NSLP and SBP are the two largest K–12 meal programs provided by federal taxpayer money. The NSLP launched in 1946 and the SBP in 1966, both as options specifically for children in poverty.82 During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal policymakers temporarily expanded access to school meal programs, but some lawmakers and federal officials have now proposed making this expansion per- manent.83 Yet even before the pandemic, research found that federal officials had already expanded these programs to serve children from upper-income homes, and these programs are rife with improper payments and inefficiencies.

Heritage Foundation research from 2019 found that after the enactment of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) in 2010, the share of students from middle- and upper-income homes receiving free meals in states that participated in CEP doubled, and in some cases tripled—all in a program meant for children from families with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty line (Children from homes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty line are eligible for free lunches, while students from families at or below 185 percent of poverty are eligible for reduced-priced lunches).84

Under CEP, if 40 percent of students in a school or school district are eligible for federal meals, all students in that school or district can receive free meals. However, the USDA has taken it even further, improperly interpreting the law85 to allow a subset of schools within a district to be grouped together to reach the 40 percent threshold, As a result, a school with zero low-income students could be grouped together with schools with high levels of low-income students, and as a result all the students in the schools within that group (even schools without a single low-in- come student) can receive free federal meals.86 Schools can direct resources meant for students in poverty to children from wealthier families.

Furthermore, the NSLP and SBP are among the most inaccurate federal
programs according to PaymentAccuracy.gov, a project of the U.S. Office of Man-
agement and Budget and the Office of the Inspector General.87 Before federal
auditors reduced the rigor of annual reporting requirements in 2018, the NSLP
had wasted nearly $2 billion in taxpayer resources through payments provided to
ineligible recipients.88 Even after the auditing changes, which the U.S. Government

Accountability Office said results in the USDA not “regularly assess[ing] the pro-
grams’ fraud risks,” the NSLP wasted nearly $500 million in FY 2021.89 The SBP
now wastes nearly $200 million annually.90

Despite the ongoing effort to expand school meals under CEP and the evidence of waste and inefficiency, left-of-center Members of Congress and President Biden’s Administration have nonetheless proposed further expansions to extend federal school meals to include every K–12 student—regardless of need.91 The Administra- tion recently proposed expanding federal school meal programs offered during the school year to be offered during the summer as part of the “American Families Plan,” and also proposed expanding CEP. Other federal officials, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT), have, in recent years, proposed expanding the NSLP to all students.92 To serve students in need and prevent the misuse of taxpayer money, the next Administration should focus on students in need and reject efforts to transform federal school meals into an entitlement program.

Specifically, the next Administration should:

Work with lawmakers to eliminate CEP. The NSLP and SBP should be directed to serve children in need, not become an entitlement for students from middle- and upper-income homes. Congress should eliminate CEP. Further, the USDA should not provide meals to students during the summer unless students are taking summer-school classes. Currently, students can get meals from schools even if they are not in summer school, which has, in effect, turned school meals into a federal catering program.93 Restore programs to their original intent and reject efforts to create universal free school meals.

The USDA should work with lawmakers to restore NSLP and SBP to their original goal of providing food to K–12 students who otherwise would not have food to eat while at school. Federal school meals should be focused on children in need, and any efforts to expand student eligibility for federal school meals to include all K–12 students should be soundly rejected. Such expansion would allow an inefficient, wasteful program to grow, magnifying the amount of wasted taxpayer resources. Reform Conservation Programs. Farmers, in general, are excellent stewards of the land, if not for moral or ethical considerations, then out of self-interest to

Promulgate a rule properly interpreting CEP. The USDA should issue
a rule that clarifies that only an individual school or a school district as a
whole, not a subset of schools within a district, must meet the 40-percent
criteria to be eligible for CEP. Education officials should be prohibited from
grouping schools together.﻿

make sure their land and—by extension, their livelihoods—remain intact. Farmers
are often called the original conservationists.94
When evaluating federal conservation programs, it is important to remember
the importance of the land to farmers. In terms of USDA federal conservation
programs, both the USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) oversee numerous programs.95

As a general matter, the next Administration should ensure that these programs address genuine and specific environmental concerns with a focus on currently existing environmental problems, not those that are speculative in nature. These conservation programs should have clearly identifiable goals, with the success or failure of these programs being directly measurable. Any assistance to farmers to take specific actions should not be provided unless the assistance will directly and clearly help to address a specific environmental problem. Further, any assistance to encourage farmers to engage in certain practices should only be provided if farmers would not have adopted the practices in the first place.

There are specific issues that the next Administration should address. The Conservation Reserve Program,96 which is run by FSA, pays farmers to not farm some of their land. This program has recently received attention, as agricultural groups rightfully seek to farm without penalty voluntarily idled land, in light of the consequences to food prices of Russia invading Ukraine.97 There is also a need to reform USDA’s conservation easements. These easements are a powerful tool to incentivize long-term preservation of ecosystems while still allowing farmers to benefit economically. However, when farmers and ranchers sign conservation easements with the USDA, they can be enforced in perpetuity. Future generations, be they the descendants of the landowner or new residents, are bound by those conditions.

Ecosystems and topography naturally change over time, but without legislative
change, easement requirements will not.

The next Administration should:

Champion the elimination of the Conservation Reserve Program.
Farmers should not be paid in such a sweeping way not to farm their land. If
there is a desire to ensure that extremely sensitive land is not farmed, this
should be addressed through targeted efforts that are clearly connected to
addressing a specific and concrete environmental harm. The USDA should
work with Congress to eliminate this overbroad program.

Reform NRCS wetlands and erodible land compliance and appeals.
Problematic NRCS overreach could be avoided entirely by removing its
authority to prescribe specific practices on a particular farm operation in
order to ensure continued eligibility to participate in USDA farm programs, and to require instead that each farm (as a function of eligibility) must have
created a general best practices plan. Such a plan could be approved by the
local county Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD). The local SWCD
commissioners are elected by their peers in each respective county and are
better suited than the NRCS to provide guidance for farm operations in
their respective jurisdictions.

At a minimum, a new Administration should support legislation to divest
more power to the states (and possibly local SWCDs) regarding erodible
land and wetlands conservation.98

Reform easements. The new Administration should, to the extent
authorized by law, limit the use of permanent easements and
collaborate with lawmakers to prohibit the USDA from creating new
permanent easements.99

Promote legislation that would allow state-inspected meat to be sold
in interstate commerce. These barriers to the sale of meat and poultry
from USDA-approved state-inspected facilities should be removed.
Eliminate or Reform Marketing Orders and Checkoff Programs. Mar-
keting orders and checkoff programs for agricultural commodities are similar in
many ways. They both allow private actors within an industry to collaborate with
the federal government to compel other competitors within an industry to fund the
respective marketing order or checkoff program. There are currently 22 checkoff

Other Major Issues and Specific Recommendations.

Although the following
issues have not been listed as “priority,” these issues are still extremely important,
and the next Administration should address them.
Only meat and poultry from federally inspected facilities can be sold in inter-
state commerce.100 Even meat and poultry from USDA-approved state-inspected
facilities may only be sold in intrastate commerce, with limited exceptions. 101
This is despite the fact that states with USDA-approved inspection programs
must meet and enforce requirements that are “at least equal to” those imposed
under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts and the Humane
Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978.102 This is an unnecessary regulatory barrier
that makes it difficult to get meat and poultry into interstate commerce to create
more options for consumers and farmers. Legislation entitled the New Mar-
kets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act of 2021 would help to remove
this obstacle.103

The next Administration should:

programs,104 and they focus on research and promotion of commodities such as beef
and eggs. Marketing orders cover research and promotion, but also cover issues
such as quality regulations and volume controls. The latter issue, volume controls,
is a means to restrict supply, which drives up prices for consumers. Fortunately,
there are few active volume controls.105

Marketing orders and checkoff programs are some of the most egregious pro-
grams run by the USDA. They are, in effect, a tax—a means to compel speech—and
government-blessed cartels. Instead of getting private cooperation, they are tools
for industry actors to work with government to force cooperation.

The next Administration should:

Reduce the number and scope of marketing orders and checkoff
programs. The USDA should reject any new requests for marketing orders
and checkoff programs to the extent authorized by law and eliminate
existing programs when possible. While the programs work differently,
there are often petition processes and other ways that make it difficult for
affected parties to get rid of the marketing orders and checkoff programs,106
and the USDA itself may not even be required to honor requests to
terminate a program.107 The USDA should make the process easier. Further,
the USDA should reject any effort to bring back volume controls to limit
supplies of commodities.

Work with Congress to eliminate marketing orders and checkoff
programs. These programs should be eliminated, and if industry actors
want to collaborate, they should do so through private means, not using the
government to compel cooperation.

Promote legislation that would require regular votes. There should
be regular voting for parties subject to checkoff programs and marketing
orders. For example, the voting should occur at least every five years, to
determine whether a marketing order or checkoff program should continue.
The USDA should be required to honor the results of such a vote. Through
regular voting, parties can demonstrate their support for a marketing order
or checkoff program and ensure that those administering them will be held
accountable.

Focus on Trade Policy, Not Trade Promotion. The USDA’s Foreign Agri-
cultural Service (FAS) covers numerous issues, including “trade policy,” which
is a reference to removing trade barriers, among other things, to ensure an envi-
ronment conducive to trade.108 It also covers trade promotion.109 This includes
programs like the Market Access Program110 that subsidizes trade associations, businesses, and other private entities to market and promote their products overseas. 

FAS should play a proactive and leading role to help open upmarkets
for American farmers and ranchers. There are numerous barriers, such as sani-
tary and phytosanitary measures, blocking American agricultural products from
gaining access to foreign markets.111 However, FAS should not help businesses and
industries promote their exports, something these businesses and industries can
and should do on their own.
The next Administration should:

Push legislation to repeal export promotion programs. The USDA
should work with Congress to repeal market development programs like the
Market Access Program and similar programs.

Counter scare tactics and remove obstacles. The USDA should strongly
counter scare tactics regarding agricultural biotechnology and adopt
policies to remove unnecessary barriers to approvals and the adoption of
biotechnology.

Repeal the federal labeling mandate. The USDA should work with
Congress to repeal the federal labeling law, while maintaining federal
preemption, and stress that voluntary labeling is allowed.
Use all tools available to remove improper trade barriers against
agricultural biotechnology. The USDA should work closely with the Office
of the United States Trade Representative to remove improper barriers
imposed by other countries to block U.S. agricultural goods.
