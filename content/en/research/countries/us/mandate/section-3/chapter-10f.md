Innovation is critical to agricultural production and the ability to meet future food needs. The next Admin- istration should embrace innovation and technology, not hinder its use—especially because of scare tactics that ignore sound science. One of the key innovations in agriculture is genetic engineering. According to the USDA, “[C]urrently, over 90 percent of U.S. corn, upland cotton, and soybeans are produced using GE [genet- ically engineered] varieties.”112

Despite the importance of agricultural biotechnology, in 2016, Congress passed
a federal mandate to label genetically engineered food.113 This legislation was argu-
ably just a means to try to provide a negative connotation to GE food. There are
other challenges as well for agricultural biotechnology. For example, Mexico plans
to ban the importation of U.S. genetically modified yellow corn.114
The next Administration should:﻿

Reform Forest Service Wildfire Management. The United States Forest
Service is one of four federal government land management agencies that admin-
ister 606 million acres, or 95 percent of the 640 million acres of surface land area
managed by the federal government.115 Located within the USDA, the Forest Service
manages the National Forest System, which is comprised of 193 million acres.116
As explained by the USDA, “The USDA Forest Service’s mission is to sustain the
health, diversity, and productivity of the nation’s forests and grasslands to meet
the needs of present and future generations.”117

The Forest Service should focus on proactive management of the forests and
grasslands that does not depend heavily on burning. There should be resilient
forests and grasslands in the wake of management actions. Wildfires have become
a primary vegetation management regime for national forests and grasslands.118
Recognizing the need for vegetation management, the Forest Service has adopted
“pyro-silviculture” using “unplanned” fire,119 such as unplanned human-caused fires,
to otherwise accomplish vegetation management.120

The Forest Service should instead be focusing on addressing the precipitous
annual amassing of biomass in the national forests that drive the behavior of
wildfires. By thinning trees, removing live fuels and deadwood, and taking other
preventive steps, the Forest Service can help to minimize the consequences
of wildfires.

Increasing timber sales could also play an important role in the effort to change
the behavior of wildfire because there would be less biomass. Timber sales and
timber harvested in public forests dropped precipitously in the early 1990s and
still remain very low. For example, in 1988, the volume of timber sold and harvested
by volume was about 11 billion and 12.6 billion board feet (BBF), respectively.121 In
2021, timber sold was 2.8 BBF and timber harvested was 2.4 BBF.
In 2018, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13855 to, among
other things, promote active management of forests and reduce wildfire risks.122
The executive order stated, “Active management of vegetation is needed to treat
these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed due to challenges
associated with regulatory analysis and current consultation requirements.”123 It
further explained the need to reduce regulatory obstacles to fuel reduction in
forests created by the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered
Species Act.124

The next Administration should:
l
Champion executive action, consistent with law, and proactive
legislation to reduce wildfires. This would involve embracing Executive
Order 13855, building upon it, and working with lawmakers to promote
active management of vegetation, reduce regulatory obstacles to reducing
fuel buildup, and increase timber sales.


Work with lawmakers to repeal the Dietary Guidelines. The USDA
should help lead an effort to repeal the Dietary Guidelines.
Minimally, the next Administration should reform the Dietary
Guidelines. The USDA, with HHS, should develop a more transparent
process that properly considers the underlying science and does not
overstate its findings. It should also ensure that the Dietary Guidelines
focus on nutritional issues and do not veer off-mission by focusing on
unrelated issues, such as the environment, that have nothing to do with
nutritional advice. In fact, if environmental concerns supersede or water
down recommendations for human nutritional advice, the public would
be receiving misleading health information. The USDA, working with
lawmakers, should codify these reforms into law.


### ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES

Based on the recommended reforms identified as ideal solutions, the USDA
would look different in many respects. One of the biggest changes would be a USDA
that is not focused on welfare, given that means-tested welfare programs would


Eliminate or Reform the Dietary Guidelines. The USDA, in collaboration
with HHS, publishes the Dietary Guidelines every five years.125 For more than 40
years, the federal government has been releasing Dietary Guidelines,126 and during
this time, there has been constant controversy due to questionable recommenda-
tions and claims regarding the politicization of the process.

In the 2015 Dietary Guidelines process, the influential Dietary Guidelines Advi-
sory Committee veered off mission and attempted to persuade the USDA and HHS
to adopt nutritional advice that focused not just on human health, but the health
of the planet.127 Issues such as climate change and sustainability infiltrated the
process. Fortunately, the 2020 process did not get diverted in this manner. How-
ever, the Dietary Guidelines remain a potential tool to influence dietary choices to
achieve objectives unrelated to the nutritional and dietary well-being of Americans.
There is no shortage of private sector dietary advice for the public, and nutrition
and dietary choices are best left to individuals to address their personal needs. This
includes working with their own health professionals. As it is, there is constantly
changing advice provided by the government, with insufficient qualifications on
the advice, oversimplification to the point of miscommunicating important points,
questionable use of science, and potential political influence.

The Dietary Guidelines have a major impact because they not only can influence
how private health providers offer nutritional advice, but they also inform federal
programs. School meals are required to be consistent with the guidelines.128
The next Administration should:﻿

be moved to HHS. The Food and Nutrition Service that administers the food and
nutrition programs would be eliminated.
The Farm Service Agency, which administers many of the farm subsidy pro-
grams, would be significantly smaller in size if the ideal farm subsidy reforms
were adopted.

Most important, a conservative USDA, as envisioned, would not be used as a
governmental tool to transform the nation’s food system, but instead would respect
the importance of efficient agricultural production and ensure that the government
does not hinder farmers and ranchers from producing an abundant supply of safe
and affordable food.

For a conservative USDA to become a reality, and for it to stay on course with
the mission as outlined, the White House must strongly support these reforms and
install strong USDA leaders. These individuals almost certainly will be faced with
opposition from some in the agricultural community who would fight changing
subsidies in any fashion, although many of the reforms would likely be embraced
by those in agriculture.

There would be strong opposition from environmental groups and others who
want the federal government to transform American agriculture to meet their ideo-
logical objectives. Finally, there would be opposition from left-of-center groups
who do not want to reform SNAP and would expand welfare and dependency—such
as through universal free school meals—as opposed to reducing dependency.
Reducing the scope of government and promoting individual freedom may not
always be easy, but it is something that conservatives regularly should strive for.
The listed reforms to the U.S. Department of Agriculture would help to accom-
plish these objectives and are well worth fighting for to achieve a freer and more
prosperous nation.

### CONCLUSION


A conservative USDA should recognize that its role is to serve the interests of all Americans, not special interests. By being a champion of unleashing the potential of American agriculture, a conservative USDA would help to ensure a future with
an abundant supply of safe and affordable food for individuals and families in the
United States and across the globe.
