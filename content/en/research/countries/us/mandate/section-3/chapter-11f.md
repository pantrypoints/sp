In addition to strengthening legal protections for parents, the next Administration should:

These congressional actions should be carefully reviewed to make
sure they complement state Parents' Bills of Rights, such as those
passed in Georgia (2022), Florida (2021), Montana (2021), Wyoming
(2017), Idaho (2015), Oklahoma (2014), Virginia (2013), and
Arizona (2010).

As documented by writers such as Abigail Shrier and others, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons documented a four-fold increase in the number of biological girls seeking gender surgery between 2016 and 2017. Larger increases were found in the U.K. from 2009 to 2019 and 2017 to 2018. These statistics and others point to a social contagion in which minor children, especially girls, are attempting to make life-altering decisions using puberty blockers and other hor- mone treatments and even surgeries to remove or alter vital body parts. Heritage Foundation research finds that providing easier access to such treatments and

Prioritize legislation advancing such rights. Promising ideas have appeared in bills introduced in the 117th Congress such as H.R.8767, the Empowering Parents Act,15 sponsored by Representative Bob Good (R-VA); H.R. 6056, the Parents’ Bill of Rights Act,16 sponsored by Representative Julia Letlow (R-LA); and H.J.Res. 99,17 proposing an amendment to the Constitution relating to parental rights, sponsored by Representative Debbie Lesko (R-AZ).

surgeries without parental involvement does not reduce the suicidality of these
young people and may even increase suicide rates.

The next Administration should take particular note of how radical
gender ideology is having a devastating effect on school-aged children
today—especially young girls.

School officials in some states are requiring teachers and other school employ- ees to accept a minor child’s decision to assume a different “gender” while at school—without notifying parents. In California, New Jersey, and certain districts in Kansas and elsewhere, educators are prohibited from informing parents about children’s confusion over their sex if the children do not want their parents to know. Such policies allow schools to drive a wedge between parents and children. The next Administration should work with Congress to provide an example to state lawmakers by requiring K–12 districts under federal jurisdiction, including Wash- ington, D.C., public schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools, and Department of Defense schools, with legislation stating that:

No public education employee or contractor shall use a name to
address a student other than the name listed on a student’s birth
certificate, without the written permission of a student’s parents
or guardians.

No public education employee or contractor shall use a pronoun
in addressing a student that is different from that student’s
biological sex without the written permission of a student’s parents
or guardians.

No public institution may require an education employee or
contractor to use a pronoun that does not match a person’s
biological sex if contrary to the employee’s or contractor’s religious
or moral convictions.

State lawmakers should use this model and adopt similar provisions for public
schools within their borders. Federal lawmakers should not allow public school
employees to keep secrets about a child from that child’s parents.
Advance School Choice Policies

The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, a voucher program providing scholarships to children from low-income families living in the nation’s capital to attend a private school of choice, is capped at $20 million annually and limited to students at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty line. The maximum scholarship amount is $9,401 for students in kindergarten through eighth grade and $14,102 for students in grades nine through 12. The average scholarship amount is around $10,000, or less than half of the current per-student funding amount in D.C. Public Schools.

Congress should expand eligibility to all students, regardless of
income or background, and raise the scholarship amount closer to
the funding students receive in D.C. Public Schools (spending per
student in 2020 was $22,856).

All families should be able to take their children’s taxpayer-funded
education dollars to the education providers of their choosing—
whether it be a public school or a private school.
Congress should additionally deregulate the program by removing
the requirement of private schools to administer the D.C. Public
Schools assessment and allowing private schools to control their
admissions processes.

The federal government oversees three school systems that Washington should
transform into examples of quality learning environments for every child in those
systems: students attending schools in Washington, D.C.; students in active-duty
military families, including students attending schools operated by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense; and students attending schools on tribal lands, which include
schools under the Bureau of Indian Education. In each of these systems, federal
lawmakers should allow every student the option of using an education savings
account so that parents can select different education products and services to
meet their child’s needs.

Nearly 50,000 students attended public schools in the District of Columbia in
the 2021–2022 school year. In 2022, fourth grade math students scored 11 points
lower than fourth graders in 2019, which means District children lost an entire
year of learning over the course of the pandemic. Eighth graders also lost an entire
year of learning in math.

Federal lawmakers should offer District students the opportunity to
use education savings accounts. A portion of a child’s federal education
spending should be deposited in a private spending account that parents can
use to pay for personal tutors, education therapists, books and curricular

Provide Education Choice for Populations
Under the Jurisdiction of Congress
materials, private school tuition, transportation and more—accounts
modeled after the accounts in Arizona, Florida, West Virginia, and seven
other states.

Members of Congress should design the same account system
for students in active-duty military families, including students
attending schools that receive funding under the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA).18

Heritage Foundation research found that if even 10 percent of the students eli-
gible for accounts under such a proposal transferred from an assigned school to an
education savings account, the change for the sending district would be 0.1 percent
of that school district’s K–12 budget. Even in heavily impacted districts (districts
with a large number of students receiving Impact Aid), the budgetary effect would
be less than 2 percent. Yet these children would then have the chance to receive a
customized education that meets their unique needs. As with state ESA programs,
families who are homeschooling are distinct in statute from families who use an
ESA to customize an education at home.

Furthermore, research from the Claremont Institute used documents pro-
vided by a whistleblower demonstrating how educators at Department of Defense
schools around the world are using radical gender theory and critical race theory
in their lessons. This instructional material discards biology in favor of political
indoctrination and applies critical race theory’s core tenets advocating for more
racial discrimination. Such ideas are highly unpopular among parents, accord-
ing to nationally representative surveys, and the course material attempts to
indoctrinate students with radical ideas about race and the ambiguous concept
of “gender.”

Finally, schools on tribal lands and under the auspices of the Bureau of Indian
Education (BIE) are among the worst-performing public schools in the country.
Research from Rep. Burgess Owens’ office reports that the graduation rate for BIE
students is 53 percent, lower than the average for Native American students in
public schools around the country, and nearly 30 percentage points lower than the
national average for all students. In 2015, Arizona lawmakers expanded the state’s
education savings account program to include children living on tribal lands, and
by 2021, nearly 400 Native American children were using the accounts.

Federal officials should design a federal education savings account
option for all children attending BIE schools.
The next Administration should make the K–12 systems under federal juris-
diction examples of quality learning opportunities and education freedom.


Washington should convert some of the lowest-performing public school systems
in the country into areas defined by choices, creating rigorous learning options for
all children and from all backgrounds, income levels, and ethnicities.
Expand Education Choice Through Portability of Existing Federal Funds

Federal lawmakers should move IDEA oversight and implementation
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Officials should then consider revising IDEA to require that a
child’s portion of the federal taxpayer spending under the law be
made available to families so parents can choose how and where a
child learns.

IDEA already allows families to choose a private school under
certain conditions, but federal officials should update the law so that
families can use their child’s IDEA spending for textbooks, education
therapies, personal tutors, and other learning expenses, similar to
the way in which parents use education savings accounts in states
such as Arizona and Florida. These micro-education savings accounts

Setting education policy on the right track long term would require sunsetting
the U.S. Department of Education altogether. Doing so would not result in fewer
resources and less assistance for children with special needs or from low-income
families. Rather, closing the federal behemoth would better target existing taxpayer
resources already set aside for these students by shifting oversight responsibilities
to federal and state agencies that have more expertise in helping these populations.
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal law gov-
erning taxpayer spending on K–12 students with special needs. The law stipulates
that students have a right to a “free and appropriate education,” and 95 percent of
children with special needs attend assigned public schools. The education is not
always appropriate, however: Special education is fraught with legal battles. Some
argue that the education of children with special needs is the most litigated area
of K–12 education. Thus, despite a nearly 50-year-old federal law that sees regular
revision and reauthorization and approximately $13.5 billion per year in federal
taxpayer spending, parents still struggle to establish intervention plans for their
students with public school district officials regarding the physical and educational
requirements for their children with special needs.

State-level education options often exclusively serve children with special needs
for these very reasons. Florida, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina,
and North Carolina, to name a few states, all have education savings accounts or
K–12 private school scholarship options for children with special needs.
would give the families of children with special needs approximately $1,800
per child to help meet a child’s unique learning needs.

Members of Congress and the White House should consider a similar
update to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
(ESEA). Title I is the largest portion of federal taxpayer spending under
this federal education law, and the section provides additional taxpayer
resources to schools or groups of schools in lower income areas. Federal
taxpayers committed $16.3 billion to Title I in FY 2019, spending that is
dedicated to students in low-income areas of the U.S. Per student, this
spending amounts to more than $1,400 for a child in a large city and
approximately $1,300 for a student in a remote, rural area.19

Research finds, though, that this enormous investment has not produced positive
results for children in need. The achievement gap between children from the highest
and lowest income deciles has not improved over the past 50 years. And recent, dismal
outcomes on the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed declines for
all students, with math scores registering declines for the first time in history.

Initially, the responsibilities for administering and overseeing Title I
should be moved to HHS, along with IDEA.

Students attending schools that receive Title I spending should also
have access to micro-education savings accounts that allow families to
choose how and where their children learn according to their needs.
Parents should be allowed to use their child’s Title I resources to
help pay for private learning options including tutoring services and
curricular materials.
Over a 10-year period, the federal spending should be phased out and
states should assume decision-making control over how to provide a
quality education to children from low-income families.

Additional School Choice Options
House Republicans included school choice in their “Commitment to
America” agenda.

Though actions by state lawmakers are essential and any federal
policies should be strictly designed so they do not conflict with state
activities, Congress could consider school choice legislation such as the Educational Choice for Children Act. This bill would create a
federal scholarship tax credit that would incentivize donors to contribute to
nonprofit scholarship granting organizations (SGOs). Eligible families could
then use that funding from the SGOs for their children’s education expenses
including private school tuition, tutoring, and instructional materials.
