### Transparency of FERPA and PPRA Complaints

The Department of Education should be transparent about
complaints filed on behalf of families regarding the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of
Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA).

At the same time, the Department of Education should develop a portal and resources for parents on their rights under FERPA and PPRA. This portal should also contain an explanation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and public school procedures to demonstrate that the law does not deprive parents of their right to access any school health records.

The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program

In 2011, Congress added new requirements to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program stating that participating private schools must submit to site visits by the program administrator, inform prospective students about the school’s accreditation status, mandate that teachers of core subjects have bachelor’s degrees, and require participating students to take some form of nationally norm-referenced test. Notably, the 2011 reauthorization also required, for the first time, that participating private schools be accredited or be on a path to accreditation. The 2017 reauthorization went further, requiring that each participating school supply a certificate of accreditation to the administering entity upon program entry, demonstrating that the school is fully accredited before being allowed to participate. The list of approved accreditors is entirely too small to serve the mission of the diverse schools in the nation’s capital.

Although the accreditation regulations should be removed entirely
by Congress, in the meantime, the next President should issue an
executive order expanding the list of allowable accreditors.
Transparency Around Program Performance and DEI Influence
The next President should issue a series of executive orders requiring:

An accounting of how federal programs/grants spread DEI/CRT/
gender ideology,
A review of outcomes for GEAR UP and the 21st Century
grants programs,

The reissuing of the report on school safety from 2018 with updated information, The release of a report to Congress on how to consolidate the department and trim nonessential employees, A report on the negative influence of action civics on students’ understanding of history and civics and their disposition toward the United States, An update of the Coleman report to show the impact of family structure on student achievement, A full accounting of CARES Act education expenditures, and A report on how many dollars make their way to the classroom in every federal education grant and program.

Pursue Antitrust Against Accreditors


### NEW POLICIES/REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND/OR THE WHITE HOUSE

The department must coordinate any rulemaking with the White House, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DOJ, and other agencies that share
responsibility with the department in the administration or enforcement of stat-
ute, such as Titles VI and IX. Moreover, regarding regulations arising under civil
rights laws administered by the department, Executive Order 12550 requires the
Attorney General to approve final regulations; the Assistant Attorney General for
Civil Rights must approve notices of proposed rulemaking.

Organizational Issues

Historical Budget Information. Congressional appropriations for the U.S.
Department of Education have risen from $14 billion in 1980 to $95.5 billion in
2021, an astounding increase, especially in light of the lack of improvements in
student outcomes.

Recommend Budget Cuts, Shifts, and Augmentations, If Any. Transferring
most of the programs at the U.S. Department of Education to other agencies and
eliminating duplicative and ineffective programs would yield significant taxpayer

The President should issue an executive order pursuing antitrust
against college accreditors, especially the American Bar
Association (ABA).

savings. The proposal would immediately save more than $17 billion annually in
various programs. Savings over a decade would be far more robust, as the revenue
responsibility for many formula grant programs would be returned to the states.
Some highlights include:

Eliminate competitive grant programs and reduce spending on
formula grant programs. Competitive grant programs operated by the
Department of Education should be eliminated, and federal spending
should be reduced to reflect remaining formula grant programs authorized
under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)
and the handful of other programs that do not fall under the competitive/
project grant category. Remaining programs managed by the Department of Education, such as large formula grant programs for K–12 education,
should be reduced by 10 percent. This would cut approximately 29 programs,
most of which are discretionary spending. In total, this would generate
approximately $8.8 billion in savings.

Eliminate the PLUS loan program. As mentioned above, the PLUS loan
program, which provides graduate student loans and loans to the parents
of undergraduate students, should be eliminated. This would generate an
estimated $2.3 billion in savings.

End time-based and occupation-based student loan forgiveness. A low
estimate suggests ending current student loan forgiveness schemes would save taxpayers $370 billion.

Eliminate GEAR-UP. It is not the responsibility of the federal government
to provide taxpayer dollars to create a pipeline from high school to college.
GEAR UP should be eliminated, and its functions should instead be handled
privately or at the state and local levels, where policymakers are better
equipped to increase college preparedness within their school districts.


### Personnel

The Department of Education currently employs approximately 4,400 indi-
viduals. As programs are eliminated or transferred to other agencies, those
employees whose positions are determined to be essential to the mission would
move with their constituent programs. Current salaries and expenses at ED total
$2.2 billion annually.
