Mission/Overview

The OCED was established in December 2021 to implement the IIJA. Its mis-
sion is “[to] deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership
with the private sector to accelerate deployment, market adoption, and the equi-
table transition to a decarbonized energy system.”51

Needed Reforms

End market distortions and stop shifting technology and
development risks to taxpayers. The OCED is distorting energy
markets and shifting the risk of new technology deployment from the
private sector to taxpayers. The IIJA provided more than $20 billion in
government subsidies to help the private sector deploy and market clean
energy and decarbonizing resources. Government should not be picking
winners and losers and should not be subsidizing the private sector to bring
resources to market.

New Policies

Eliminate OCED. The next Administration should work with Congress
to eliminate all DOE energy demonstration programs, including those
in OCED. Taxpayer dollars should not be used to subsidize preferred
businesses and energy resources, thereby distorting the market and
undermining energy reliability.

Refocus on resources that will support reliability. To the extent that
the various energy research and development funding authorities cannot
be repealed, funded projects should be consistent with the programmatic
goals of the next Administration. For example, the already awarded
Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program should help to move SMRs
from pilot scale to commercialization and in the process address material,
fuel, and regulatory issues that would pose deployment risk to utilities and
Wall Street.

Budget

DOE’s FY 2023 budget request includes $214 million “to initiate a new $150
million competition to support demonstrations that address integration issues of
renewable energy into the U.S. transmission and distribution grids.”52 Overall, the
“$21.5 billion provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law”53 supports several
OCED programs:

lAdvanced Reactor Demonstration Projects ($2.5 billion).
lCarbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects ($937 million).
lCarbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program ($2.5 billion).
l
Clean Energy Demonstration Program on Current and Former Mine Land
($500 million).

lEnergy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas ($1 billion).
lIndustrial Demonstrations Program ($6.3 billion).
lLong Duration Energy Storage Demonstrations ($505 million).
lRegional Clean Energy Hubs ($8 billion).
lRegional Direct Air Capture Hubs ($3.5 billion).54


Personnel

By drawing resources from across the DOE, the OCED has already grown to 70
personnel in six months. If OCED is eliminated, those positions can be eliminated.
If OCED is reduced, its personnel can be reduced to fit its scope.


## LOAN PROGRAM OFFICE (LPO)

### Mission/Overview

“LPO’s mission is to finance next-generation U.S. energy infrastructure,”
serve “as a bridge to bankability for breakthrough projects and technologies,”
and “de-risk[] them at early stages of investment so they can be developed at
commercial scale and achieve market acceptance.”55 The Biden Administration
directed the program to subsidize the Administration’s “net zero” energy tran-
sition away from conventional fuels by 2050 and to promote union jobs and
domestic supply chains.56

The LPO coordinates with the U.S. Treasury Federal Financing Bank and is
organized into seven divisions: Outreach and Business Development, Origination,
Portfolio Management, Risk Management, Technical and Project Management,
Legal, and Management and Operation. Its loan programs were originally designed
as temporary programs but have since been amended and expanded. Specifically:

The IRA expanded the authority in [LPO’s] existing programs, 1703, ATVM,
and Tribal Energy Finance, by $100B. IRA also created the Energy
Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Financing Program (1706) which
can support up to $250B in loan authority. The CO2 Infrastructure
Finance and Innovation Act (CIFIA)—authorized by the [bipartisan
infrastructure law], appropriates $2.1B to support approximately $25B in
flexible, low-interest loans. This new legislation will create jobs and wealth,
address environmental justice and equity priorities and strengthen our
energy security and supply chains.57

Needed Reforms

Taxpayers should not be backing risky business ventures or politically pre-
ferred commercial enterprises. To save tax dollars and reduce current risk, the
new Administration:

Should not back any new loans or loan guarantees.
Should seek to sunset DOE’s loan authority through Congress and
eventually eliminate the Loan Program Office.

DOE-backed loans and loan guarantees put taxpayers at undue risk, distort
private-sector investment decisions, shift private money toward projects with
political support, and create additional barriers to entry for companies that are
outside of the government’s definition of “innovative” or for companies that choose
not to participate.


### New Policies

To the extent that DOE loan programs cannot be repealed, the new Administration should:

Strengthen due diligence and increase transparency in DOE
loan programs.
Limit the use of new loan or loan guarantee authority to projects
that will promote the reliability and resilience of the electric
grid and other energy infrastructure and support national
security objectives.
Establish clear mandatory qualifications requiring applicants to
comply with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act58 and to
certify that they are not financed with any other local, state, or
federal taxpayer-backed loan, loan guarantee, or bond (such as a
state “green bank”).


## ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY–ENERGY (ARPA–E)

Mission/Overview

ARPA–E was created in 2007 as part of the America Competes (Creating Oppor-
tunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology Education) Act.59 Its
statutory goals are “to enhance the economic and energy security of the United
States through the development of energy technologies” that reduce “imports of
energy from foreign sources;” reduce “energy-related emissions, including green-
house gases;” improve “the energy efficiency of all economic sectors;” and “ensure
that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying
advanced energy technologies.”60

Some in Congress see ARPA–E as beneficial because the COMPETES Act pro-
vides it with more bureaucratic flexibility than other federal programs are allowed.
Its goals are essentially the same as those of DOE’s applied energy offices, but its
structure is different, and it is focused around individual programs instead of
around offices with longer-term agendas.


Needed Reforms

Stop risking taxpayer dollars as venture capital for the private
sector. ARPA–E tends to see its mission as bringing technology from
idea to commercialization. Often called the investment trough, ARPA–E
is effectively funding projects that the private sector is unwilling to fund.
Taxpayers should not in effect be picking winners and losers—and having
their dollars at risk but not gaining the economic rewards of success.
End duplicative efforts. Another problem is that ARPA–E’s mission is
similar to the missions of DOE’s applied energy offices. If DOE’s applied
energy offices are doing their jobs correctly, they will use Funding
Opportunities Announcements, prizes, lab calls, and other funding
mechanisms that are needed to accomplish a specific goal. In other words,
ARPA–E is at best duplicating the work done by other DOE offices.

New Policies

Eliminate ARPA-E. The next Administration should work with Congress
to eliminate ARPA–E. The agency is unnecessary, risks taxpayer dollars,
and interferes with risk-benefit decisions that should be made by the
private sector.

Budget

Congress appropriated $427 million for ARPA–E in FY 2021, and slightly more
than $700 million has been requested for FY 2023.61
