### MISSION STATEMENT

A conservative U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will support local and state efforts, building them up so that they may
lead.

This will include the sharing of federal resources and agency expertise. Creating environmental standards from the ground up is con-
sistent with the concept of cooperative federalism embedded within many of the agency’s authorizing statutes and will create earnest relationships among local officials and regulated stakeholders.

This in turn will promote a culture of compliance.
A conservative EPA will track success by measured progress as opposed to the
current perpetual process and will convey this progress to the public in clear, con-
cise terms. True transparency will be a defining characteristic of a conservative
EPA. This will be reflected in all agency work, including the establishment of open-
source science, to build not only transparency and awareness among the public, but also trust.

The challenge of creating a conservative EPA will be to balance justified skep-
ticism toward an agency that has long been amenable to being coopted by the Left
for political ends against the need to implement the agency’s true function: pro-
tecting public health and the environment in cooperation with states. Further, the
EPA needs to be realigned away from attempts to make it an all-powerful energy
and land use policymaker and returned to its congressionally sanctioned role as
environmental regulator.



### OVERVIEW

The Status Quo. The Biden Administration EPA has returned to the same top-down, coercive approach that defined the Obama
Administration. There has been a reinstitution of unachievable standards designed
to aid in the “transition” away from politically disfavored industries and technolo-
gies and toward the Biden Administration’s preferred alternatives. This approach
is most obvious in the Biden Administration’s assault on the energy sector as the
Administration uses its regulatory might to make coal, oil, and natural gas opera-
tions very expensive and increasingly inaccessible while forcing the economy to
build out and rely on unreliable renewables.1 This approach has also been applied
to pesticides and chemicals as the Biden Administration pushes the “greening” of
agriculture and manufacturing among other industrial activities.

As a consequence of this approach, we see the return of costly, job-killing
regulations that serve to depress the economy and grow the bureaucracy but do
little to address, much less resolve, complex environmental problems. In some
instances, these actions even work to undermine environmental efforts as they
push industries overseas to countries whose enforcement of pollution-control
requirements is seriously deficient—if indeed they have any meaningful require-
ments at all. Meanwhile, agency costs and staffing have increased significantly.
The EPA’s fiscal year (FY) 2023 request included a 28.8 percent increase in fund-
ing and a 13.3 percent increase in staffing, making it the “highest funding ever”
in EPA’s history.2

Compared to the Obama Administration, there is one key difference in the
Biden Administration’s approach: In a concerted effort to diminish congressio-
nal oversight, the position of EPA Administrator has been overshadowed by the
creation of multiple “Climate Czars” at the Biden White House. In effect, current
EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who has a reputation as a well-meaning, gen-
erally capable former state official, has been left out of the political loop, serving
mostly as a pleasant distraction from EPA’s expansive, costly, and economy-de-
stroying agenda.

A Coopted Mission. The EPA has been a breeding ground for expansion of
the federal government’s influence and control across the economy. Embedded
activists have sought to evade legal restraints in pursuit of a global, climate-themed
agenda, aiming to achieve that agenda by implementing costly policies that oth-
erwise have failed to gain the requisite political traction in Congress. Many EPA
actions in liberal Administrations have simply ignored the will of Congress, align-
ing instead with the goals and wants of politically connected activists.
Pursuit of this globally focused agenda has distracted the agency from fulfilling
its core mission, thereby creating a backlog of missed statutory deadlines,3 and
at times has even led to preventable environmental disasters.

During the Obama Administration, for example, the U.S. experienced two of the worst environmental disasters in decades, including the Flint, Michigan, water crisis in 20144 and the
Gold King Mine spill in 2015.5

Beyond creating such immediate and tangible harm in various communities,
an EPA led by activism and a disregard for the law has generated uncertainty in
the regulated community, vendetta-driven6 enforcement, weighted analytics,
increased costs, and diminished trust in final agency actions. Although the U.S.
environmental story is very positive, there has been a return to fear-based rhetoric
within the agency, especially as it pertains to the perceived threat of climate change.
Mischaracterizing the state of our environment generally and the actual harms
reasonably attributable to climate change specifically is a favored tool that the Left
uses to scare the American public into accepting their ineffective, liberty-crushing
regulations, diminished private property rights, and exorbitant costs.

In effect, the
Biden EPA has once again presented a false choice to the American people: that
they have to choose between a healthy environment and a strong, growing economy.
Historical Role and Purpose. For many decades, rapid industrial activity
with an unorganized approach to environmental standards significantly degraded
the country’s environment. Particle pollution in the form of a thick, fog-like haze
that at times was laced with harmful metals was a frequent occurrence across the
country.7 More than 40 percent of communities failed to meet basic water quality
standards, and in 1969, the Cuyahoga River infamously caught fire after sparks
from a passing train ignited debris in the water, which was filled with heavy indus-
trial waste.8

EPA was established on December 2, 1970, following a call by President Rich-
ard Nixon to “rationally and systematically” organize existing piecemeal efforts
to clean up and protect the environment.9 Under Reorganization Plan No. 3, the
EPA was to initiate a “coordinated attack on the pollutants which debase the air
we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that grows our food.”10 Numerous
authorities were consolidated and given to the EPA including research, monitor-
ing, standard-setting, and enforcement activities. The mission to protect public
health and the environment was born, and the first Administrator was sworn in
on December 4, 1970.

Congress followed suit with the landmark Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA)11 and
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972.12 The subsequent Clean Air Act
Amendments of 199013 played a significant role in the expansion of EPA’s responsi-
bilities and legal authority with the agency then being tasked with the development
of new regulatory mechanisms that included, among other things, cap-and-trade
programs for the control of sulfur dioxide and technological standards for nitrogen
oxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, a vastly expanded hazardous air
pollutant program, a federal operating permit program, and new regulations gov-
erning phaseout of the production of ozone-depleting substances in conjunction
with U.S. ratification of the Montreal Protocol in 1988.14

Subsequently, especially during the Obama Administration, EPA experienced
massive growth as it was used to pursue far-reaching political goals to the point
where its current activities and staffing levels far exceeded its congressional man-
dates and purpose. This expansive status is entirely unnecessary: It has nothing
to do with improving either the environment or public health. The EPA’s initial
success was driven by clear mandates, a streamlined structure, recognition of the
states’ prominent role, and built-in accountability. Fulfilling the agency’s mis-
sion in a manner consistent with a limited-government approach proved to be
extremely effective during the agency’s infancy.

Back to Basics. EPA’s structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed
to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government. This
will require significant restructuring and streamlining of the agency to reflect
the following:


State Leadership. EPA should build earnest relationships with state and
local officials and assume a more supportive role by sharing resources and
expertise, recognizing that the primary role in making choices about the
environment belongs to the people who live in it.

Accountable Progress. Regulatory efforts should focus on addressing
tangible environmental problems with practical, cost-beneficial, affordable
solutions to clean up the air, water, and soil, and the results should be
measured and tracked by simple metrics that are available to the public.
Streamlined Process. Duplicative, wasteful, or superfluous programs that
do not tangibly support the agency’s mission should be eliminated, and a
structured management program should be designed to assist state and
local governments in protecting public health and the environment.
Healthy, Thriving Communities. EPA should consider and reduce as
much as possible the economic costs of its actions on local communities to
help them thrive and prosper.

Compliance Before Enforcement. EPA should foster cooperative
relationships with the regulated community, especially small businesses,
that encourage compliance over enforcement.
Transparent Science and Regulatory Analysis. EPA should make
public and take comment on all scientific studies and analyses that support
regulatory decision-making.
