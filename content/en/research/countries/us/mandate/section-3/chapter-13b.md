This will provide executive and logistical support for the EPA Administrator. Its stated purpose is to support
EPA leadership and activities. To implement policies that are consistent with a
conservative EPA, the agency will have to undergo a major reorganization. The
Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy position within the Administrator’s office should
be renamed the Deputy Chief of Staff for Regulatory Improvement. 

Thiswould oversee a reorganization effort that includes the following actions:

Returning the enforcement and compliance function to the media offices
(air, water, land, and emergency management, etc.) and eliminating the
stand-alone Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance, which has
created a mismatch between standard-setting and implementation.
Using enforcement to ensure compliance, not to achieve
extrastatutory objectives.

Developing a plan for relocating regional offices so that they are
more accessible to the areas they serve and deliver cost savings to the
American people.

Restructuring the Office of International and Tribal Affairs into the
American Indian Environmental Office and returning the international
liaison function to media offices where appropriate.
Eliminating the Office of Public Engagement and Environmental Education
as a stand-alone entity and reabsorbing substantive elements into the Office
of Public Affairs.

Relocating the Office of Children’s Health Protection and the Office of Small
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization from the AO and reabsorbing
those functions within the media offices (air, water, land, and emergency
management, etc.).

Reviewing the grants program to ensure that taxpayer funds go to
organizations focused on tangible environmental improvements free from
political affiliation.

Returning the environmental justice function to the AO, eliminating the
stand-alone Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.

Resetting science advisory boards to expand opportunities for a diversity of
scientific viewpoints free of potential conflicts of interest.
Restoring the guidance portal to ensure that regulatory and subregulatory
standards are clear to affected entities.
Working with Assistant Administrators to implement major reforms in
media offices.

Day One Executive Order. To initiate the review and reorganization, a Day
One executive order should be drafted for the incoming President with explicit
language requiring reconsideration of the agency’s structure with reference to
fulfilling its mission to create a better environmental tomorrow with clean air, safe
water, healthy soil, and thriving communities. The order should set up “pause and
review” teams to assess the following:

Major Rules and Guidance Materials. Identify existing rules to be stayed
and reproposed and initiate rule development in appropriate media offices.
Pending Petitions. Grant new petitions for rule reconsideration and
stays of rules.

Grants. Stop all grants to advocacy groups and review which potential
federal investments will lead to tangible environmental improvements.
Legal Settlements. Reassess any “sue and settle” cases and develop a
new policy to establish standard review and oversight, including public
notification and participation.

Employee Review. Determine the opportunity to downsize by
terminating the newest hires in low-value programs and identify relocation
opportunities for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions.
Budget Review. Develop a tiered-down approach to cut costs, reduce the
number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, and eliminate duplicative
programs. EPA should not conduct any ongoing or planned activity for
which there is not clear and current congressional authorization, and it
should communicate this shift in the President’s first budget request.
Risk Management Policy. Revise guidance documents that control
regulations such as the social cost of carbon; discount rates; timing of regulatory review (before options are selected); causality of health effects;

low-dose risk estimation (linear no-threshold analysis); and employment
loss analysis.

Personnel

The majority of the political appointee team must be assembled, vetted, and
ready to deploy before Day One. To the extent provided by the Federal Vacan-
cies Reform Act,15 appointees in consideration for Senate-confirmed positions
(excluding the Administrator) should be prepared to serve as a Deputy or Principal
Deputy to get into the agency on Day One while their nomination and affiliated
confirmation processes proceeds. In addition to a deputy slated for the Assistant
Administrator role, each office will need a political chief of staff, senior advisers
designated to run suboffices, and energized assistants. Teams should be balanced
with technical knowledge, legal expertise, and political exposure. Ideally, they
should also be geographically diverse. Appointee positions should also extend to
all the regional offices and specialty labs.

OFFICE OF AIR AND RADIATION (OAR)

Issue a rule to ensure consistent and transparent consideration of costs.
When doing cost-benefit analysis, use appropriate discount rates, focus
on the benefits of reducing the pollutant targeted by Congress, identify
“co-benefits” separately, and acknowledge the uncertainties involved in
quantifying benefits.

Review and revise Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT)
cost guidance to ensure that calculations are accurate and reflect the
actual regulatory burden, including costs of air rules implementation
and compliance.

OAR develops national programs, policies, and regulations to control air
pollution and radiation exposure. In recent decades, OAR and its statutory respon-
sibilities under the Clean Air Act have been reimagined in an attempt to expand
the reach of the federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has stopped and
stricken several actions from OAR under liberal Administrations, citing a lack of
requisite legal support. A reformed OAR should focus on EPA’s mission of limiting
and minimizing criteria and hazardous air pollutants in partnership with the states.
Cross-Cutting Reforms. OAR consists of four suboffices with two located in
Washington, D.C.; one in Ann Arbor, Michigan; and one at Research Triangle Park
in Raleigh, North Carolina. The following reforms should be implemented across
all OAR offices:

Obey Congress’s direction in CAA § 32116 to “conduct continuing
evaluations” of the employment and plant-closure effects of air regulations.
Ensure that all provisions of CAA § 307(d)17 are observed. Congress placed
special constraints on air rules, and that intent should be respected.
To the extent that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)18 remains in place,
ensure to the maximum extent possible that grants and funding are
provided to state regulatory entities and not to nonprofits.
Remove any regulations or requirements that confer on third parties
any authorities that have been provided to EPA, such as the oil and gas
supplemental, which created a Super-Emitter Response Program that
allows third parties to act as EPA enforcers.

Policy-Specific Actions

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

EPA adopted by regulation a goal of restoring natural visibility by 2064. The
statute does not require this, and EPA should consider whether a longer
timeline is less disruptive or more realistic. Regional haze rules should be
revised to prevent subsequent “planning periods” from being abused to
compel the shutdown of disfavored facilities.
Under the Good Neighbor Program/Interstate pollutant transport
program, review Biden-era regulations to ensure that they do not
“overcontrol” upwind states in violation of the statute as construed by
the U.S. Supreme Court. Reverse the program’s 2022 expansion beyond
power plants.

Putting guardrails on downwind states is an abuse of the CAA § 126(b)19
petition process. EPA must ensure, in keeping with statutory text, that
petitions identify a reasonably discrete “group” of upwind sources alleged to
violate the good neighbor provision.

Ensure that the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) considers
all of the statutorily charged factors (for example, social and economic
effects resulting from NAAQS attainment and maintenance strategies).
Ensure that the requirements EPA puts on a state that has achieved
attainment status from nonattainment status are limited to those that are statutorily required, and remove any regulatory differences between
attainment and maintenance that are not explicitly required by law.

Streamline the process for state and local governments to demonstrate
that their federally funded highway projects will not interfere with
NAAQS attainment.

Adopt policies to prevent abuse of EPA’s CAA “error correction”
authority.20 EPA historically has used this to coerce states into
adopting its favored policies on pain of imposition of a Federal
Implementation Plan (FIP).

Limit EPA’s reliance on CAA § 30121 general rulemaking authority to ensure
that it is not abused to issue regulations for which EPA lacks substantive
authority elsewhere in the statute.

If possible, return the standard-setting role to Congress.
