## COVID and Structural Reform. 

COVID-19 exposed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as perhaps the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government. CDC continually misjudged COVID-19, from its lethality, transmissibility, and origins to treatments. We were told masks were not needed; then they were made mandatory. CDC botched the development of COVID tests when they were needed most. When it was too late, we were told to put our lives on hold for “two weeks to flatten the curve;” that turned into two years of interference and restrictions on the smallest details of our lives. Congress should ensure that CDC’s legal authorities are clearly defined and limited to prevent a recurrence of any such arbitrary and vacillating exercise of power. The CDC should be split into two separate entities housing its two distinct func- tions. 

On the one hand, the CDC is now responsible for collecting, synthesizing, and publishing epidemiological data from the individual states—a scientific  data-gathering function. This information is crucial for medical and public health researchers around the country. On the other hand, the CDC is also responsible for making public health recommendations and policies—an inescapably political function. At times, these two functions are in tension or clear conflict. 

In February 2022, for example, it was reported that “[t]wo full years into the pandemic, the agency leading the country’s response to the public health emergency has pub- lished only a tiny fraction of the data it has collected,” much of which “could [have helped] state and local health officials better target their efforts to bring the virus under control.” A CDC spokesman said that one of the reasons was “fear that the information might be misinterpreted.”4

These distinct functions should be separated into two entirely separate agencies with a firewall between them. We need a national epidemiological agency responsible only for publishing data and required by law to publish all of the data gathered from states and other sources. A separate agency should be responsible for public health with a severely confined ability to make policy recommendations. The CDC can and should make assessments as to the health costs and benefits of health interventions, but it has limited to no capacity to measure the social costs or benefits they may entail. For example, how much risk mitigation is worth the price of shutting down churches on the holiest day of the Christian calendar and far beyond as happened in 2020? What is the proper balance of lives saved versus souls saved? The CDC has no business making such inherently political (and often unconstitutional) assessments and should be required by law to stay in its lane. The CDC’s initial COVID-19 testing failures were largely the result of that agen- cy’s prioritizing its own development and production of tests using its internal staff and facilities. The private sector is much better positioned to tackle the chal- lenges inherent in developing and manufacturing novel products, as illustrated by the relative success of the alternative approach to facilitating the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics by private companies that was adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

When it comes to testing, the CDC’s role should similarly be to facilitate rather than supplant the efforts of private test developers, academic laboratories, state public health laboratories, and clinical testing providers. When responding to a novel pathogen, the CDC should focus on gathering and disseminating information, including specimens needed for development of positive controls and reference panels, and ensuring that test developers can develop and validate diagnostic tests. These changes will require a shift in priorities and culture at the CDC—and throughout HHS more broadly.5

Most problematically, the CDC presented itself as a kind of “super-doctor” for
the entire nation. The CDC is a public health institution, not a medical institution.
According to its mission statement, the agency focuses on “disease prevention and﻿

control, environmental health, and health promotion and health education activi-
ties.”6 It is not qualified to offer (and usually does not purport to offer) professional
medical opinions applicable to specific patients.

From time to time, the CDC offers findings and recommendations that compe-
tent medical practitioners often will consider in arriving at a professional medical
judgment for a particular patient. In this respect, CDC guidelines are analogous
to guidelines from other public health associations or medical societies: They are
informative, not prescriptive.

By statute or regulation, CDC guidance must be prohibited from taking on a prescriptive character. For example, never again should CDC officials be allowed to say in their official capacity that school children “should be” masked or vaccinated (through a schedule or otherwise) or prohibited from learning in a school building. Such decisions should be left to parents and medical providers. We have learned that when CDC says what people “should” do, it readily becomes a “must” backed by severe punishments, including criminal penalties. CDC should report on the risks and effectiveness of all infectious disease-mitigation measures dispassionately and leave the “should” and “must” policy calls to politically accountable parties. Conflicts of Interest. There was a time when the CDC could not take money from the pharmaceutical industry, but in 1992, the agency discovered a loophole in federal law that allowed it to accept pharma contributions through the nonprofit CDC Foundation. The money started flowing immediately: From 2014 through 2018, the CDC Foundation received $79.6 million from pharmaceutical corpo- rations like Pfizer, Biogen, and Merck.7 This practice presents a stark conflict of interest that should be banned.



### Data Systems

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the disastrous public health consequences of the CDC’s failure to follow multiple congressional mandates to modernize its data infrastructure. Current reporting methods are burdensome for frontline medical workers, yet they result only in fragmented data that are not available in real time or usable across systems. Congress should require HHS to prioritize the electronic collection and dis- semination of robust, privacy-protected data that better leverages existing systems while reducing burdens on clinicians. HHS should also enter into a public–private partnership with a data-management expert to develop a system that makes crit- ical information available to health care workers and policymakers in real time.8 The CDC operates several programs related to vaccine safety including the Vac- cine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS); Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD); and Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project. Those functions and their associated funding should be transferred to the FDA, which is responsible for post-market surveillance and evaluation of all other drugs and biological products. Respect for Life and Conscience. The CDC should eliminate programs and projects that do not respect human life and conscience rights and that undermine family formation. It should ensure that it is not promoting abortion as health care.

It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that
it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health
and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks
of intentionally taking a human life through abortion.

The CDC oversaw and funded the development and testing of the COVID-19
vaccines with aborted fetal cell lines, insensitive to the consciences of tens of
thousands to hundreds of thousands of people who objected to taking a vac-
cine with such a link to abortion. As evidenced by litigation across the country,
it is likely that thousands were fired unjustly because of the exercise of their
consciences or faith on this question, which could have been avoided with a
modicum of concern for this issue from CDC. There is never any justification for
ending a child’s life as part of research, and the research benefits from splicing or
growing aborted fetal cells and aborted baby body parts can easily be provided
by alternative sources. All such research should be prohibited as a matter of
law and policy.

CDC should update its public messaging about the unsurpassed effectiveness of
modern fertility awareness–based methods (FABMs) of family planning and stop
publishing communications that conflate such methods with the long-eclipsed
“rhythm” or “calendar” methods. CDC should fund studies exploring the evi-
dence-based methods used in cutting-edge fertility awareness.
Data Collection. The CDC’s abortion surveillance and maternity mortality
reporting systems are woefully inadequate. CDC abortion data are reported by
states on a voluntary basis, and California, Maryland, and New Hampshire do not
submit abortion data at all. Accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion,
abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths are essential to timely,
reliable public health and policy analysis.

Because liberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism, HHS
should use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every
state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what
gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and
by what method. It should also ensure that statistics are separated by category:
spontaneous miscarriage; treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child
(such as chemotherapy); stillbirths; and induced abortion. In addition, CDC should
require monitoring and reporting for complications due to abortion and every
instance of children being born alive after an abortion. Moreover, abortion should
be clearly defined as only those procedures that intentionally end an unborn child’s
life. Miscarriage management or standard ectopic pregnancy treatments should
never be conflated with abortion.

Comparisons between live births and abortion should be tracked across vari-
ous demographic indicators to assess whether certain populations are targeted by
abortion providers and whether better prenatal physical, mental, and social care
improves infant outcomes and decreases abortion rates, especially among those
who are most vulnerable.

The Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 20239
would amend title XIX of the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act
to improve the CDC’s abortion reporting mechanisms by requiring states, as a
condition of federal Medicaid payments for family planning services, to report
streamlined variables in a timely manner.

The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which
legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)
and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.
