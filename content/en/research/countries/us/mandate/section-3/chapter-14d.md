The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the world’s largest biomedical
research agency and is made up of 27 different components called Institutes and
Centers. Despite its popular image as a benign science agency, NIH was respon-
sible for paying for research in aborted baby body parts, human animal chimera
experiments, and gain-of-function viral research that may have been responsible
for COVID-19.


### Bioethics Reform

Research using fetal tissue obtained from elective abortions
is immoral and obsolete. Research using human embryonic stem cells also involves
the destruction of human life and should not be subsidized with taxpayer dollars.
Good science and life-affirming, ethical research are not mutually exclusive. In
fact, ethically derived sources such as discarded surgical tissue and adult stem cells
(made pluripotent), not tissue obtained from elective abortions, have contributed
the most successful treatments for a variety of ailments.


Congress authorized HHS to choose not to fund extramural abortion-derived fetal tissue research that fails ethics advisory board review, and in 2019, the Trump Administration’s HHS chose that course. Subsequently, however, the Biden
Administration restored unrestricted funding of abortion-derived fetal tissue
research. HHS should:

Promptly restore the ethics advisory committee to oversee abortion-
derived fetal tissue research, and Congress should prohibit such
research altogether.

End intramural research projects using tissue from aborted children
within the NIH, which should end its human embryonic stem
cell registry.

Aggressively implement a plan to pursue and fund ethical alternative
methods of research in order to ensure that abortion and embryo-
destructive related research, cell lines, and other testing methods
become both fully obsolete and ethically unthinkable.

In addition, the Administration should reconvene a new National Council on
Bioethics (NCB) to discuss new and emerging areas of ethical concern, to assess
whether the ends justify the means when it comes to the promise of therapies
and cures, and to establish what limiting principles should guide research and
health policy. Because the male–female dyad is essential to human nature and
because every child has a right to a mother and father, three-parent embryo cre-
ation and human cloning research should be banned. A new NCB should convene
leading experts to examine these issues and provide policy recommendations for
the new frontier of bioethical questions that our country will have to address in
the coming years.

Finally, HHS should create and promote a research agenda that supports pro-
life policies and explores the harms, both mental and physical, that abortion has
wrought on women and girls.

Conflicts of Interest. NIH maintains inappropriate industry ties that create
serious conflicts of interest. In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study
on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry.19
More recently, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),
Anthony Fauci’s division of the NIH, owns half of the patent for the Moderna
COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents.20 Rather than pro-
viding grants to university-based investigators to run the clinical trials on their own
Moderna vaccine, the NIH conducted this research internally—a clear conflict of
interest. The NIAID will earn millions from this vaccine’s revenue with several
NIH employees (and their heirs) personally receiving up to $150,000 annually
from Moderna vaccine sales.21﻿

In May 2022, documents obtained pursuant to a FOIA request revealed that
NIH Director Francis Collins, NAIAD Director Anthony Fauci, and Fauci’s Deputy
Director, Clifford Lane, all received royalties from pharmaceutical companies
between 2009 and 2014.22 Nonprofit watchdog Open the Books estimates that from
2010 to 2020, third parties paid more than $350 million in royalties to NIH and
its scientists, who are credited as coinventors. Most problematically, in the years
when they received payments, Collins, Fauci, and Lane were NIH administrators,
not researchers, with no plausible claim to be scientific co-discoverers.
Most of the world’s other advanced science countries have stricter prohibitions
on such conflicts, which helps to explain why the most significant studies on COVID
treatments, on natural immunity, and on vaccine efficacy have come mostly from
outside the U.S. Funding for scientific research should not be controlled by a small group of
highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power
for decades. The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken. 

Term limits should be imposed on top career leaders at the NIH, and Congress should consider block granting NIH’s grants budget to states to fund their own scientific research. Nothing in this system would prevent several states from partnering to co-fund large research projects that require greater resources or impact larger regions. Likewise, the establishment of funding for scientific research at the state level does not preclude more modest federal funding through the National Insti- tutes of Health: The two models are not mutually exclusive. The CDC and NIH Foundations, whose boards are populated with pharma- ceutical company executives, need to be decommissioned. Private donations to these foundations—a majority of them from pharmaceutical companies—should not be permitted to influence government decisions about research funding or public health policy.


### Woke Policies

Under Francis Collins, NIH became so focused on the #MeToo movement that it refused to sponsor scientific conferences unless there were a cer- tain number of women panelists, which violates federal civil rights law against sex discrimination. This quota practice should be ended, and the NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, which pushes such unlawful actions, should be abolished. NIH has been at the forefront in pushing junk gender science. Instead, it should fund studies into the short-term and long-term negative effects of cross- sex interventions, including “affirmation,” puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries, and the likelihood of desistence if young people are given counseling that does not include medical or social interventions.


## CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS)

With the goal of being a societal safety net, Medicare and Medicaid touch more
American lives than does any other federal program. While they help many, they operate as runaway entitlements that stifle medical innovation, encourage fraud, and impede cost containment, in addition to which their fiscal future is in peril.
Both programs should be managed so that the individuals enrolled are empowered to make decisions for themselves and have quality options with affordable prices driven by competition and innovation. Providers who participate should
retain (or have restored) the freedom to practice medicine and take care of their
patients according to their patients’ unique needs.

Medicare. Medicare should be reformed according to four goals and principles:

Increase Medicare beneficiaries’ control of their health care.
Patients are best positioned to determine the value of health care
services, working with their health care providers. They also benefit from
increased choice of doctors, hospitals, and insurance plans. Access to
reliable information with respect to physicians, hospitals, and insurers is
therefore essential.

Reduce regulatory burdens on doctors. Doctors must be free to focus on
treating patients first, not entering codes on computers, and should not be
tempted to change their medical judgment based on arbitrary or illogical
reimbursement incentives.

Ensure sustainability and value for beneficiaries and taxpayers.
Prices are best for patients when determined by economic value rather
than political power and when they are known in advance of the receipt of
services. Government’s use of non-market-based methods to determine
reimbursement leads to overspending on low-value services and products
and underpayment for high-value services and products, stifles beneficial
innovation, and because of Medicare’s size distorts payments throughout
the health care system. Intermediate entities that can manage financial risk
and ensure quality of care are important in transitioning to value-based care
within the Medicare program.

Reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, including through the use of artificial
intelligence for their detection.

Regulatory Reforms. Medicare regulations restrict choice of coverage and
care. The next Administration should reintroduce and restore regulations and
demonstrations from the Trump Administration that were withdrawn, weakened,
or never finalized by the Biden Administration, including:

The Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technologies (MCIT) rule;

The Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) rule;
The Medicare Advantage Qualifying Payment Arrangement Incentive
(MAQI) demonstration; and
The Global and Professional Direct Contracting (GPDC, rebranded as the
Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community
Health or ACO REACH) model.

Additionally, regulations should advance site neutrality by eliminating the inpa-
tient-only list and expanding the ambulatory surgical center covered procedures
list. Medicare generally pays more for inpatient hospital procedures and less for
the same procedures performed in an outpatient setting. Whether a medical ser-
vice is delivered in a physician’s office, a clinic, or a hospital setting, the Medicare
payment for that service should be the same. CMS should expand the application
of site-neutral payment options to more settings. Such a policy would level the
playing field among providers and remove the financial disabilities for medical
professionals who would compete with hospital systems.23

Finally, HHS needs to restore and enhance conscience protection regulations
that allow medical practitioners to participate in federal health care programs
without being compelled to provide sex changes or similar services.
