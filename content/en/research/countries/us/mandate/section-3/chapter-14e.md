Remove restrictions on physician-owned hospitals. The Affordable
Care Act (ACA)24 imposed restrictions prohibiting Medicare from
reimbursing physician-owned and specialty hospitals. The current
restrictions do little more than serve the special interests of large hospital
systems and undercut consumer choice of high-quality, specialty care.
These restrictions should be removed so that physician-owned hospitals can
compete with other hospitals in serving Medicare patients.25
Encourage more direct competition between Medicare Advantage
and private plans. Medicare Advantage (MA), a system of competing
private health plans, is the major alternative to traditional Medicare for
America’s large and growing cohort of seniors. The program provides
beneficiaries with a wide range of competitive health plan choices—a richer
set of benefits than traditional Medicare provides and at a reasonable cost.
Equally as important, the MA program has been registering consistently
high marks for superior performance in delivering high-quality care.
Critical reforms are still needed to strengthen and improve the program for
the future. Specifically:

1. Make Medicare Advantage the default enrollment option.
2. Give beneficiaries direct control of how they spend Medicare dollars.
3. Remove burdensome policies that micromanage MA plans.
4. Replace the complex formula-based payment model with a competitive
bidding model.
5. Reconfigure the current risk adjustment model.
6. Remove restrictions on key benefits and services, including those related
to prescription drugs, hospice care, and medical savings account plans.26
Legacy Medicare Reform. Legislation reforming legacy (non-MA)

Medicare should:

Replace the bureaucrat-driven fee-for-service system with value-
based payments to empower patients to find the care that best serves
their needs.

Codify price transparency regulations.

Restructure 340B drug subsidies27 toward beneficiaries rather
than hospitals.
Repeal harmful health policies enacted under the Obama and Biden
Administrations such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program28 and
Inflation Reduction Act.29

Medicare Part D Reform. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created a drug
price negotiation program in Medicare that replaced the existing private-sector
negotiations in Part D with government price controls for prescription drugs.
These government price controls will limit access to medications and reduce
patient access to new medication.

This “negotiation” program should be repealed, and reforms in Part D that
will have meaningful impact for seniors should be pursued. Other reforms should
include eliminating the coverage gap in Part D, reducing the government share in

Base payments on the health status of the patient or intensity of the
service rather than where the patient happens to receive that service.﻿

the catastrophic tier, and requiring manufacturers to bear a larger share. Until the
IRA is repealed, an Administration that is required to implement it must do so in a
way that is prudent with its authority, minimizing the harmful effects of the law’s
policies and avoiding even worse unintended consequences.30

Medicaid. Over the past 45 years, Medicaid and the health safety net have
evolved into a cumbersome, complicated, and unaffordable burden on nearly every
state. The program is failing some of the most vulnerable patients; is a prime target
for waste, fraud, and abuse; and is consuming more of state and federal budgets.
The dramatic increase in Medicaid expenditures is due in large part to the ACA
(Obamacare), which mandates that states must expand their Medicaid eligibility
standards to include all individuals at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty
level (FPL), and the public health emergency, which has prohibited states from
performing basic eligibility reviews.

The overlap of available benefits among the various health agencies has led
to a complex, confusing system that is nearly impossible to navigate—even for
recipients. Recipients are often faced with a “welfare cliff” of benefit losses as they
earn above a certain amount, which is contrary to the fundamental purpose of
empowering individuals to achieve economic independence. Benefits increasingly
involve nonmedical services such as air conditioning and housing, many of which
are already handled by departments other than HHS.

Improper payments within Medicaid are higher than those of any other federal
program. These payments are evidence of the inappropriateness of Medicaid’s
expansion, which, stemming largely from public health emergency maintenance
of effort (MOE) requirements and the Affordable Care Act, has crowded out the
primary targets of these programs: those who are most in need.
True health care reform cannot be accomplished in a bureaucratic silo or only
through Medicaid and health safety net programs. Reform of the tax code is also
essential to genuine, effective reform of our health care system. All components
of the health care system should be part of the reform efforts, and it is imperative
that the system be modified to assist states with their current programs. Therefore,
the next Administration should:

Reform financing. Allow states to have a more flexible, accountable,
predictable, transparent, and efficient financing mechanism to deliver
medical services. This system should include a more balanced or blended
match rate, block grants, aggregate caps, or per capita caps. Any financial
system should be designed to encourage and incentivize innovation and
the efficient delivery of health care services. Federal and state financial
participation in the Medicaid program should be rational, predictable, and
reasonable. It should also incentivize states to save money and improve the
quality of health care.

Direct dollars to beneficiaries more effectively and responsibly. The
current funding structure for the Medicaid program rewards expansions,
lacks transparency, and promotes financing gimmicks. CMS should:

1.
End state financing loopholes.
2. Reform payments to hospitals for uncompensated care.
3. Replace the enhanced match rate with a fairer and more
rational match rate.
4. Restructure basic financing and put the program on a more fiscally
predictable budget (which should include reform of Disproportionate
Share Hospital payments to hospitals).31

Strengthen program integrity. Make program integrity a top priority and
the responsibility of the states. To protect the taxpayers’ investment:
1.
2. Improve Medicaid eligibility standards to protect those in need.
As Medicaid enrollment continues to climb, it is imperative that there
are appropriate and accurate eligibility standards to ensure that the
program remains focused on serving those who are in need. To this
end, CMS should:

a. Hold states accountable for improper eligibility determinations.
b. Require more robust eligibility determinations.
c. Strengthen asset test determinations within Medicaid.32
3. Conduct oversight and reform of managed care.33
l
Incentivize personal responsibility. CMS should allow states to ensure
that Medicaid recipients have a stake in their personal health care and a
say in decisions related to the Medicaid program. Personal responsibility

Incentivize states. An enhanced contingency fee should be paid to
states that successfully increase their efforts to decrease waste, fraud,
and abuse. The current system’s IT development 90/10 matching rate
should be allowed for improvements in states’ current fraud and abuse
and eligibility systems. Innovative programs that show a positive return
on investment for both the state and federal governments should be
allowed without the onerous waiver process.
and consumer choice for Medicaid recipients must go together as standard
components of the safety net, especially for able-bodied recipients.
Medicaid recipients, like the rest of Americans, should be given both the
freedom to choose their health plans and the responsibility to contribute to
their health care costs at a level that is appropriate to protect the taxpayer.

Add work requirements and match Medicaid benefits to beneficiary
needs. Because Medicaid serves a broad and diverse group of individuals, it
should be flexible enough to accommodate different designs for different
groups. For example, CMS should launch a robust “personal option” to allow
families to use Medicaid dollars to secure coverage outside of the Medicaid
program. CMS should also:

1.
Clarify that states have the ability to adopt work incentives for able-
bodied individuals (similar to what is required in other welfare
programs) and the ability to broaden the application of targeted
premiums and cost sharing to higher-income enrollees.

2. Add targeted time limits or lifetime caps on benefits to disincentivize
permanent dependence.34

Allow private health insurance. Congress should allow states the option
of contributing to a private insurance benefit for all members of the family
in a flexible account that rewards healthy behaviors. This reform should also
allow catastrophic coverage combined with an account similar to a health
savings account (HSA) for the direct purchase of health care and payment of
cost sharing for most of the population.

Increase flexible benefit redesign without waivers. CMS should
add flexibility to eliminate obsolete mandatory and optional benefit
requirements and, for able-bodied recipients, eliminate benefit mandates
that exceed those in the private market. This should include flexibility to
redesign eligibility, financing, and service delivery of long-term care to serve
the most vulnerable and truly needy and eliminate middle-income to upper-
income Medicaid recipients.

Eliminate current waiver and state plan processes. CMS should
allow providers to make payment reforms without cumbersome waivers
or state plan amendment processes where possible. More broadly, the
federal government’s role should be oversight on broad indicators like cost
effectiveness and health measures like quality, health improvement, and wellness and should give the balance of responsibility for Medicaid program
management to states. This reform would include adding Section 111535
waiver requirements in some cases (such as imposing work requirements
for able-bodied adults) while rescinding requirements in others (such as
non–health care benefits and services related to climate change).
