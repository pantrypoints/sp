Allocate funding to strategy programs promoting father involvement
or terminate parental rights quickly. ACYF is currently considering
different programs to encourage parents, especially fathers, to engage with
their children in foster care. While these program ideas and initiatives are
still in the early planning stages, promoting responsible parenthood to
reintegrate children or at least keep a consistent male figure in the minor’s
life is crucial. At the same time, in cases where the father or mother does
not make a sincere or serious effort to be involved in the child’s upbringing,
termination of parental rights for children in foster care should be swift.


### OFFICE OF HEAD START (OHS)

Eliminate the Head Start program. Head Start, originally established
and funded to support low-income families, is fraught with scandal and
abuse. With a budget of more than $11 billion, the program should function
to protect and educate minors. Sadly, it has done exactly the opposite. In
fact, “approximately 1 in 4 grant recipients had incidents in which children
were abused, left unsupervised, or released to an unauthorized person
between October 2015 and May 2020.”68 Research has demonstrated that
federal Head Start centers, which provide preschool care to children from
low-income families, have little or no long-term academic value for children.
Given its unaddressed crisis of rampant abuse and lack of positive outcomes,
this program should be eliminated along with the entire OHS. At the very
least, the program’s COVID-19 vaccine and mask requirements should
be rescinded.


### ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING (ACL)

Support palliative care. Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is legal in 10
states and the District of Columbia. Legalizing PAS is a grave mistake that
endangers the weak and vulnerable, corrupts the practice of medicine
and the doctor–patient relationship, compromises the family and
intergenerational commitments, and betrays human dignity and equality
before the law. Instead of embracing PAS, policymakers should focus on
the benefits of palliative care, which works to improve a patient’s quality
of life by alleviating pain and other distressing symptoms of a serious
illness. HHS ACL should survey their programs to ensure that they are
supporting vulnerable persons of age or disability and are not facilitating or
encouraging participation in PAS.


Readdress the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers. While
in theory the strategy aims to support family members with duties to care
for older family members, the plan is overly focused on racial and “LGBTQ+
equity.” The strategy should be examined to establish an efficient plan to
support caregivers and their families. There should also be a review of its
COVID-19 policies.

HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA)

Congress should allow CMS to use the 340B data that HRSA collects
rather than having CMS conduct its own survey, especially in view
of the U.S. Supreme Court’s American Hospital Association v. Becerra
decision.69 The legislation should also create penalties for those who do not
respond to HRSA’s data collection.

Legally define the locus of service as where the provider is located
during the telehealth visit rather than where the patient is. With such
a definition, states could continue to reserve their powers to establish the
standards for licensure and scope of practice. The providers could ensure
continuity and consistency of care no matter where their patients might
move while maintaining the licenses that make the most sense for them.

Americans are far more mobile and technologically advanced today than
they were when most health care laws were written. Telehealth has become
increasingly important, particularly during the height of the COVID-19
pandemic. It also has great potential in rural and other areas where there
are shortages of health care providers. HRSA’s Office for the Advancement
of Telehealth includes a program known as the Licensure Portability Grant
Program, which bolsters state efforts to reform licensing laws to maximize
telehealth flexibility. HRSA does not have the authority through this office
to dictate licensure laws; that power has typically been reserved to the
states. However, telehealth across state lines, when permitted, is interstate
commerce, which can be regulated by the federal government according to
the Constitutionn.

Restore Trump religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive
mandate (also a CMS rule). HHS should rescind, if finalized, the
regulation titled “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the
Affordable Care Act,” proposed jointly by HHS, Treasury, and Labor.70 This
rule proposes to amend Trump-era final rules regarding religious and
moral exemptions and accommodations for coverage of certain preventive
services under the ACA. Preventive services include contraception, and it appears the proposed rule would change the existing regulations for
religious and moral exemptions to the ACA’s contraception mandate.

There is no need for further rulemaking that curtails existing exemptions
and accommodations.

Require HRSA to use rulemaking to update the women’s preventive
services mandate. The contraceptive mandate issued under Obamacare
has been the source of years of egregious attacks on many Americans’
religious and moral beliefs. The mandate was issued as part of the women’s
preventive services guidelines, which were issued without any rulemaking
that involved public notice and an opportunity to comment.

Instead, HRSA
issued and changed the mandate by simply posting changes to its website.
HRSA also started off not requiring coverage of fertility awareness–based
methods of family planning, then requiring them, and then removing the
requirement without notifying the public. A federal judge recently ruled
that this failure to undergo notice and comment in issuing the mandate
is unlawful. HRSA should be required to repromulgate any women’s
preventive services mandates through the notice and comment process that
is compliant with the Administrative Procedures Act.
﻿
Moreover, since the Obama Administration HRSA entered into long-
term contracts with the pro-abortion American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG) and related entities to serve as an exclusive
adviser with respect to the content of this mandate, HRSA has used
this arrangement to ignore comments that members of the public were
sometimes able to submit in the process, and ACOG has abused its
position to attack HHS’s allowance of religious and moral exemptions
to the contraceptive mandate. HHS should rescind these contracts and
establish an advisory committee that is compliant with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act and has members that are committed to women’s preventive
services and are not pro-abortion ideologues.

Expand inclusion of fertility awareness–based methods and supplies
to family planning in the women’s preventive services mandate. The
ACA requires coverage of and prevents insurance plans from imposing
any cost-sharing requirements on women who obtain preventive care and
screenings as defined by HRSA. In 2016, HHS included “instruction in
fertility awareness-based methods” as part of this requirement. However,
in December 2021, HHS removed that language from its list without
using the notice-and-comment process or giving any rationale, both of
which are mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act. 

In August 2022, a federal court blocked this attempt to eliminate health insurance
coverage for fertility awareness–based methods of family planning from
requirements that cover at least 58 million women, and the judge made his
ruling permanent in December 2022. HRSA should promulgate regulations
consistent with this order.

HHS should more thoroughly ensure that fertility awareness–based
methods of family planning are part of women’s preventive services under
the ACA. FABMs often involve costs for materials and supplies, and HHS
should make clear that coverage of those items is also required. FABMs
are highly effective and allow women to make family planning choices in a
manner that meets their needs and reflects their values.

Eliminate men’s preventive services from the women’s preventive
services mandate. In December 2021, HRSA updated its women’s
preventive services guidelines to include male condoms after claiming for
years that it had no authority to do so because Congress explicitly limited
the mandate to “women’s” preventive care and screenings. HRSA should not
incorporate exclusively male contraceptive methods into guidelines that
specify they encompass only women’s services.

Eliminate the week-after-pill from the contraceptive mandate as a
potential abortifacient. One of the emergency contraceptives covered
under the HRSA preventive services guidelines is Ella (ulipristal acetate).
Like its close cousin, the abortion pill mifepristone, Ella is a progesterone
blocker and can prevent a recently fertilized embryo from implanting in a
woman’s uterus. HRSA should eliminate this potential abortifacient from
the contraceptive mandate.

Withdraw Ryan White guidance allowing funds to pay for cross-sex
transition support. HRSA should withdraw all guidance encouraging
Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program service providers to provide controversial
“gender transition” procedures or “gender-affirming care,” which cause
irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them.
Ensure that training for medical professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.)
and doulas is not being used for abortion training. HHS should ensure
that training programs for medical professionals—including doctors, nurses,
and doulas—are in full compliance with restrictions on abortion funding
and conscience-protection laws. In addition, HHS should:

1.
Investigate state medical school compliance with the Coats–Snowe
Amendment,71 which prohibits discrimination against health care
entities that do not provide or undergo training for abortion.

2. Ensure that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) complies with all relevant conscience statutes and
regulations and that states have taken the affirmative steps (for example,
by issuing regulations) to assure compliance with Coats–Snowe.
3. Communicate to medical schools that any abortion-related training
must be on an opt-in rather than opt-out basis.
4. Require states that receive HHS funds to issue regulations or enter into
arrangements with accrediting bodies to comply with the Coats–Snowe
Amendment’s prohibition of mandatory abortion training by individuals
or institutions. The Coats–Snowe Amendment specifically requires
such state regulations or arrangements.

Prioritize funding for home-based childcare, not universal day care.
As HRSA’s Early Childhood Health page outlines, “Currently, only about
half of U.S. preschoolers are on-track with their development and ready
for school. And more than one in four of children (28%) who experience
abuse or neglect are under 3 years old.”72 Concurrently, children who spend
significant time in day care experience higher rates of anxiety, depression,
and neglect as well as poor educational and developmental outcomes.
Instead of providing universal day care, funding should go to parents
either to offset the cost of staying home with a child or to pay for familial,
in-home childcare.

Provide education and resources on early childhood health. By
partnering with new organizations like the Center on Child and Family
Poverty, HRSA should provide resources and information on the importance
of the mother–child relationship in child well-being. This should include
relationship education curricula that equip mothers and caregivers to
connect with and improve their understanding of their infants, toddlers, and
young children.

Maternal and Child Health. Currently, the HRSA Maternal and Child Health
program is collecting data on the benefits of doulas in improving the health, safety,
and emotional well-being of mothers at birth. Doulas provide a patient-focused,
nonmedical support system for single or married mothers that “decreases the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the length of labor by 25%, the use of oxytocin by
40%, and requests for an epidural by 60%. Doulas often use the power of touch
and massage to reduce stress and anxiety during labor.”73

Given concerns about maternal mortality or postpartum depression that is
worsened by poor birth experiences, doulas should be an active option for all
women whether they are giving birth in a traditional hospital, through midwifery,
or at home. Additionally, since most Doulas’ services are not covered by traditional
insurance programs, the Maternal and Child Health program should work to pro-
vide funding for low-income mothers.
