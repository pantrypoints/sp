### Bureau of Land Management Headquarters

BLM headquarters belongs in the American West. After all, the overwhelming majority of the 245 million surface acres (10 percent of the nation’s landmass) managed by the agency lies in the 11 western states and Alaska: A mere 50,000 surface acres lie elsewhere. Moreover, 97 percent of BLM employees are located in the American West.

Thus, the Trump Administration’s decision to relocate BLM headquarters from Washington, D.C., to the West was the epitome of good governance: That is, it was not only well-informed, but it was also implemented efficiently, effectively, and with an eye toward affected career civil servants. Plus, despite overblown chatter from the inside-the-Beltway media, Congress, with bipartisan support, approved funding the move.

Meanwhile, state, tribal, and local officials, the diverse collection of stakehold- ers who use public lands and western neighbors became accustomed to having top BLM decision-makers in Grand Junction, Colorado, rather than up to 4 time zones away. All of them also appreciated that the BLM’s top subject matter experts were located not in the District of Columbia, but in the western states that most need their knowledge and expertise. Westerners no longer had to travel cross country to address BLM issues. Neither did officials in the West, closest to the resources and people they manage.

On July 16, 2019, Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt delivered to Con-
gress the proposal for the relocation of nearly 600 BLM headquarters employees.
On August 10, 2020, Secretary Bernhardt formally established the Robert F. Burford
headquarters—named after the longest-serving BLM director, a Grand Junction
native—with a staff of 41 senior officials and assistants. Another 76 positions were
assigned to BLM state offices in western communities such as Billings, Montana;
Boise, Idaho; Reno, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Cheyenne, Wyoming, to meet
critical needs. Scores of other positions were assigned to the states that required
BLM expertise. For example, wild horse and burro professionals were relocated
to Nevada, home to nearly 60 percent of these western icons. Sixty-one positions
were retained in Washington, D.C., to address public, congressional, and regulatory
affairs, Freedom of Information Act compliance, and budget development.
Despite the dislocating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BLM successfully filled hundreds of long-vacant positions, as well as those that opened because of the move West.

The BLM saw notable numbers of applicants for these positions—
so numerous that the BLM capped the number of eligible applicants to no more
than 50. Obviously, reduced commuting times (often from hours to mere minutes),
lower cost of living, and opportunity to access vast public lands for recreation made
these jobs attractive to potential employees. Many, if not most, applicants stated
they would not have applied had the positions been based in Washington, D.C. At
the same time, western positions attracted those with the skills needed to meet
the BLM’s multiple-use, sustained-yield mandate, disproving the claim that the
BLM was suffering a “brain drain.”

The Trump Administration recognized that, despite its attractions, not every-
one employed by BLM in Washington, D.C., could move West. The Administration
applied a hands-on approach, with all-employee briefing and question-and-answer
sessions, regular email communications, and a website devoted to frequently asked
questions. Two human resources teams aided employees wishing to remain in
federal jobs in the D.C. area: All received new opportunities.

The BLM’s move West incurred no legal challenges, no formal Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity or U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board complaints, and no
adverse union activity. It is hard to please everyone, but the Trump Administra-
tion’s BLM did just that, putting the lie to assertions, by some, that the BLM was
trying to “fire” federal employees.

The total cost of $17.9 million for relocation incentives, permanent change-of-
station moves, temporary labor, travel, printing, rent, supplies, equipment, and other contracts will save money for the American people. For example, in fiscal 2020, the BLM estimated $1.6 million in travel costs savings, which will grow
slightly over time, and $1.9 million in savings from its terminated lease in Washington, D.C. Furthermore, BLM estimated that, by October 2022, the BLM move West would generate a net savings of $3.5 million, which, the following fiscal year,
would increase to $10.3 million.

Those funds can be devoted to reducing the risk of wildfires, increasing recre-
ational opportunities, conserving public lands, and addressing tough issues such
as wild horses and burros. Moreover, those funds will be used more wisely thanks
to the efficiency of senior, seasoned managers working closely with BLM field
employees in near daily contact with western officials, stakeholders, and neighbors.
In late 2022, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced the return of
headquarters and scores of highly paid, senior employees to Washington, D.C. Sub-
sequently, BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning revealed 56 BLM jobs in BLM’s
“Western Headquarters” and 70 other BLM jobs will remain in Grand Junction,
an increase of 15 from the 41 announced by Trump’s BLM in 2019, and an increase
of 40 other jobs above the 16 first announced by Biden officials. Thus, the director,
the two deputy directors, six of seven assistant directors (ADs) and their staffs are
now or soon will be in Washington.

The Biden Administration failed to recognize the wisdom of having BLM’s lead-
ership, including its director, deputy directors, and ADs in the West. That is why,
decades ago, the AD and staff in charge of BLM’s firefighters were relocated to Boise,
Idaho, where they remain. Not so the head of BLM law enforcement and security,
who supervises over 200 uniformed law enforcement rangers and 76 special agents
stationed mainly in 11 western states and Alaska. Haaland moved that official to
Washington, far from state troopers, county sheriffs and deputies, and city police
with whom BLM law enforcement officers keep the peace in the West’s wide-open
spaces. BLM’s “top cop” might as well be on the moon.

The AD in charge of oil, gas, and minerals was also moved to Washington, D.C.,
notwithstanding that most oil, gas, and minerals are in the West and Alaska; New
Mexico’s Permian Basin, for example, is second only to Alaska in petroleum poten-
tial, and Montana and Wyoming’s Powder River Basin contains the world’s best
low-sulfur coal. The AD responsible for wild horses and burros was moved east as
well, despite the fact that the uncontrolled growth of wild horses and burros poses
an existential threat to public lands; 60 percent of the nation’s wild horses are in
Nevada,45 but thousands are in nine other western states. There is no way these
and other ADs can professionally manage issues thousands of miles and multiple
time zones away.

It is not just effective and responsive management that has been lost; Colorado
lost its chance to become a must-visit destination for BLM’s stakeholders. Those
seeking to develop world-class mineral deposits in Minnesota or another Prudhoe Bay in Alaska; to expand recreation across BLM’s vast, diverse, and unique landscapes; or to manage timber and rangelands to prevent wildfires, would all journey
to Grand Junction.

Convention opportunities on Colorado’s western slope would
abound for BLM’s disparate constituencies to congregate and meet with BLM
leadership. The Western States Sheriffs’ Association, for example, whose annual
gathering attracts hundreds of law enforcement officers from 17 western and plains
states might have moved its event to Grand Junction.

Law Enforcement Officers. In 2002, at the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior in the days following the 9/11 attack, the Inspector General (IG) for DOI
made a series of department-wide recommendations regarding law enforcement.
Then-Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton ordered adoption of those recommendations, which drew strong bipartisan support from Congress. Over the years, most were implemented. One, however, remained undone: placing all BLM law
enforcement officers (LEOs), that is, its 212 Law Enforcement Rangers and 76
Special Agents, in an exclusively law enforcement chain of command.

This was not just the IG’s recommendation in 2002, but that of every IG who fol-
lowed. It is also the strong recommendation of the department’s top LEO. Moreover,
it has been the urgent recommendation of law enforcement professionals across
the country, especially in the West, for decades, including the Western States Sher-
iffs Association. 

Unfortunately, over time, BLM leadership stonewalled, adhering
to a haphazard system in which LEOs reported to non-LEO superiors, including
not only state directors, but also district and field managers with expertise in other
fields—range management or petroleum engineering, for example—with only 24
hours of law enforcement study. Obviously, those managers lack a comprehensive
understanding of law enforcement issues—constitutional, legal, and tactical. 

In addition, they do not uniformly apply or enforce rules of conduct or ethical standards for LEOs and special agents, leading to weakened esprit de corps and morale. 

Worse yet, because of their duties as managers of the multiple-use lands under their jurisdiction, they are exposed to conflicts of interests and may intentionally or unintentionally prevent LEOs from investigating violations or applying the law. 

In the final days of the Trump Administration, Secretary David L. Bernhardt
ordered, and Deputy Director William Perry Pendley implemented, the IG’s recom-
mendation. Of course, leadership heads exploded; they were furious with their loss
of authority, not to mention subordinates and budgets. Unfortunately, in the first
days of the Biden Administration, BLM Deputy Director Mike Nedd suspended
Pendley’s order.

Nonetheless, LEOs, the BLM, and westerners want LEOs—who make life-and-
death decisions—to be as well-trained and well-equipped as possible. They should
report to a professional, expert, and knowledgeable chain of command. After all,
they protect visitors to BLM lands and the natural and cultural resources of those
lands, as well as the employees who manage those lands.﻿

BLM’s LEOs must keep in touch, work closely, and coordinate with fellow fed-
eral, state, and local law enforcement officers. In the Trump Administration, they
joined state and local law enforcement in arresting dangerous suspects in Cortez,
Colorado; responded to a request from a rural sheriff in Arizona to rescue a family
stuck in freezing temperatures; and, teamed up in an all-hands-on-deck effort to
locate a missing American Indian teenager in rural Montana. More important,
western LEOs need the assurance that the BLM LEOs with whom they work are
professionals who report through a professional chain of command.

Wild Horses and Burros. In 1971, Congress ordered the BLM to manage wild
horses and burros to ensure their iconic presence never disappeared from the
western landscape. For decades, Congress watched as these herds overwhelmed
the land’s ability to sustain them, crowded out indigenous plant and other animal
species, threatened the survival of species listed under the Endangered Species
Act, invaded private and permitted public land, disturbed private property rights,
and turned the sod into concrete. BLM experts said in 2019 that some affected land
will never recover from this unmitigated damage.

There are 95,000 wild horses and burros roaming nearly 32 million acres in the
West—triple what scientists and land management experts say the range can sup-
port. These animals face starvation and death from lack of forage and water. The
population has more than doubled in just the past 10 years and continues to grow
at a rate of 10 to 15 percent annually. This number includes the more than 47,000
animals the BLM has already gathered from public lands, at a cost to the American
taxpayer of nearly $50 million annually to care for them in off-range corrals.
This is not a new issue—it is not just a western issue—it is an American issue.
What is happening to these once-proud beasts of burden is neither compassionate
nor humane, and what these animals are doing to federal lands and fragile ecosys-
tems is unacceptable. In 2019, the American Association of Equine Practitioners
and the American Veterinary Medication Association—two of the largest organi-
zations of professional veterinarians in the world—issued a joint policy calling for
further reducing overpopulation to protect the health and well-being of wild horses
and burros on public lands. The National Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board,
a panel of nine experts and professionals convened to advise the BLM, endorsed
the joint policy. Furthermore, animal welfare organizations such as the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the
United States recognize that the prosperity of wild horses and burros on public
lands is threatened if herds continue to grow unabated.

The BLM’s multi-pronged approach in its 2020 Report to Congress46 included expanded adoptions and sales of horses gathered from overpopulated herds;
increased gathers and increased capacity for off-range holding facilities and pastures; more effective use of fertility control efforts; and improved research, in concert with the academic and veterinary communities, to identify more effective contraceptive techniques and strategies. All of that will not be enough to solve the problem, however. Congress must enact laws permitting the BLM to dispose
humanely of these animals.
