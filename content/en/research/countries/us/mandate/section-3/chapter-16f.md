The Biden Administration has breached its federal trust responsibilities to
American Indians. This is unconscionable. Specifically, the Biden Administra-
tion’s war on domestically available fossil fuels and mineral sources has been
devastating. To wit:

The ability of American Indians and tribal governments to develop their
abundant oil and gas resources has been severely hampered, depriving
them of the revenue and profits to which they are entitled during a time of
increasing worldwide energy prices, forcing American Indians—who are
among the poorest Americans—to choose between food and fuel.
Indian nations with significant coal resources have some of the
highest quality and cleanest-burning coal in the world, but the Biden
Administration has sought to destroy the market for their coal by
eliminating coal-fired electricity in the country and to prevent the transport
of their coal for sale internationally. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration,
at great public expense, artificially boosted the demand for electric
vehicles, which, because of their remote locations, the absence of increased
electricity demands for charging electric vehicles nearby, and the distances
to be traveled, are not a choice for Indian communities.

A significant percentage of critical minerals needed by the United States
is on Indian lands, but the Biden Administration has actively discouraged
development of critical mineral mining projects on Indian lands rather than
assisting in their advancement.
Despite Indian nations having primary responsibility for their lands and
environment and responsibility for the safety of their communities, the
Biden Administration is reversing efforts to put Indian nations in charge of
environmental regulation on their own lands.
Moreover, Biden Administration policies, including those of the DOI, have dis-
proportionately impacted American Indians and Indian nations.

When ending COVID protocols at Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools,
Biden’s DOI failed to ensure an accurate accounting of students returning
from school shutdowns, which presents a significant danger to the families
that trust their children to that federal agency.
The BIE is not reporting student academic assessment data to ensure
parents and the larger tribal communities know their children are learning
and are receiving a quality education.
The new Administration must take the following actions to fulfill the nation’s
trust responsibilities to American Indians and Indian nations:

End the war on fossil fuels and domestically available minerals and
facilitate their development on lands owned by Indians and Indian nations.
End federal mandates and subsidies of electric vehicles.
Restore the right of tribal governments to enforce environmental
regulation on their lands.
Secure the nation’s border to protect the sovereignty and safety of
tribal lands.


By its failure to secure the border, the Biden Administration has
robbed Indian nations on or near the Mexican border of safe and secure
communities while permitting them to be swamped by a tide of illegal drugs,
particularly fentanyl.

Overhaul BIE schools to put parents and their children first.


Finally, the new Administration should seek congressional reauthorization
of the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations,96 which provided a $1.9 bil-
lion Trust Land Consolidation Fund to purchase fractional interests in trust or
restricted land from willing sellers at fair market value, but which sunsets Novem-
