Despite the DOJ’s pronouncements that violent crime continues to be a top pri-
ority, it has increased across the United States. The department’s leadership must
make actually reducing violent crime a priority across the United States—and it
must do so in partnership with state and local officials in a manner that is tailored
to the needs and conditions in those states and localities.

Targeting Violent and Career Criminals, Not Parents. The next conserva-
tive Administration must ensure that the Department of Justice devotes significant
effort to reducing violent crime nationwide. The Attorney General should require
all U.S. Attorneys to develop a jurisdictional-specific plan—whenever possible in
coordination with state and local law enforcement—to reduce violent crime within
each of their districts. Then the Attorney General should hold each U.S. Attorney
accountable for achieving actual results.

In recent years, federal and state officials have succumbed to calls from
anti–law enforcement advocates for so-called criminal justice reform. The pleas-
ant-sounding terminology of reform masks the darker reality of this movement,
which is one that has supported dismantling effective federal, state, and local
law enforcement and stripped away some of the most fundamental tools that law
enforcement has long had at its disposal. This campaign is not just ill-advised; it
has clearly had real-world consequences in the form of catastrophic increases in
crime—particularly violent crime—nationwide. As discussed in the next section,
the Department of Justice has a special obligation to restore law and order in
such districts.37

Juxtaposed against this increase in violent crime are things like Attorney Gen-
eral Merrick Garland’s October 4, 2021, memorandum directing the commitment
of significant resources and energies to combating imaginary, politically conve-
nient threats of violence toward members of school boards and their staffs during
the heat of the Virginia gubernatorial race.38 There was no similar effort to inves-
tigate elected officials and other public officers who conspired with outside allies
to target and harass parents who were merely exercising their constitutional and
statutory rights.39 If we are to continue to have informed and civil dialogue in the
United States on issues of public concern, the DOJ must enforce applicable civil
rights laws in an even-handed way when citizens’ livelihoods are threatened merely
because they have exercised their rights.

Enhancing the Federal Focus on and Resources in Jurisdictions with
Rule-of-Law Deficiencies. A disturbing number of state and local jurisdictions
have enacted policies that directly undermine public safety, leave doubt about
whether criminals will be punished, and weaken the rule of law. While the prose-
cution of criminal offenses in most jurisdictions across the country must remain
the responsibility of state and local governments, the federal government owes a
special responsibility to Americans in jurisdictions where state and local prose-
cutors have abdicated this duty.40

Jurisdictions suffering from deficiencies in the rule of law warrant, as appropri-
ate within our federal system, greater attention and additional federal resources
that are sufficient to protect the rights of American citizens and federal interests.
In the next conservative Administration, the DOJ, acting primarily through its U.S.
Attorneys, should therefore:

Use applicable federal laws to bring federal charges against
criminals when local jurisdictions wrongfully allow them to evade
responsibility for their conduct.41 The department should also increase
the federal law enforcement presence in such jurisdictions and explore
innovative solutions to bring meaningful charges against criminals and
criminal organizations in such jurisdictions.

Where warranted and proper under federal law, initiate legal action
against local officials—including District Attorneys—who deny
American citizens the “equal protection of the laws” by refusing to
prosecute criminal offenses in their jurisdictions. This holds true
particularly for jurisdictions that refuse to enforce the law against criminals
based on the Left’s favored defining characteristics of the would-be offender
(race, so-called gender identity, sexual orientation, etc.) or other political
considerations (e.g., immigration status).
Pursue policies and legislation that encourage prosecution of
violent crimes as well as appropriate sentences for such offenses.
The Biden Administration has adopted policies that do not prevent armed
career criminals, who actually commit violent crimes, from committing
those crimes. A recent U.S. Sentencing Commission report shows that
armed career criminals are consistently sentenced below their minimum
sentencing guidelines range.42

There are valid reasons for sentence reductions in particular cases (for
example, if the defendant has provided substantial assistance in prosecuting
other offenders). At the same time, the DOJ must ensure that its line attorneys are consistently using the tools at their disposal in cases with violent offenders, including pursuing mandatory minimum sentences under
the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).43 The department should also
support legislative efforts to provide further tools, such as the Restoring the
Armed Career Criminal Act, which Senators Tom Cotton (R–AR), Marsha
Blackburn (R–TN), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R–MS) introduced in 2021 in
response to U.S. Supreme Court decisions neutering the ACCA.44

Enforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable. Capital
punishment is a sensitive matter, as it should be, but the current crime
wave makes deterrence vital at the federal, state, and local levels. However,
providing this punishment without ever enforcing it provides justice neither
for the victims’ families nor for the defendant. The next conservative
Administration should therefore do everything possible to obtain finality for
the 44 prisoners currently on federal death row. It should also pursue the
death penalty for applicable crimes—particularly heinous crimes involving
violence and sexual abuse of children—until Congress says otherwise
through legislation.45


### DISMANTLING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES

Criminal organizations are as old as crime itself, but are more extensive,
sophisticated, and dangerous today than at any other point in history. The
Department of Justice has a key role in tackling transnational criminal orga-
nizations like Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Mexican drug cartels as well as
purely domestic criminal organizations like those built on the more traditional
mafia crime model as part of its obligation to ensure the safety and security of
the American people.

The department’s primary directive under the next Administration should be
to return to an unapologetic focus on dismantling these criminal organizations
and incarcerating their membership. Once this reprioritization occurs, the depart-
ment’s political leadership should take concrete steps to use agency reach and
resources to prevent these criminal organizations from operating and surviving.
Assaulting the business model of these criminal organizations—which are massive,
diversified enterprises with nationwide or international operations—is essential
for success. The next Administration will therefore need to:

Revitalize the DOJ’s use of the array of statutory tools that exist for
dealing with the threat of criminal organizations. The most potent
ones are the simplest. For example, the department should:

1. Rigorously prosecute as much interstate drug activity as possible,
including simple possession of distributable quantities.46 Recent efforts
to create the impression that drug possession crimes are not serious
offenses has contributed to the explosion of criminal organization
activities in the United States.

2. Aggressively deploy the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO),47 which Congress expressly created to
empower the Department of Justice to treat patterns of intrastate-
level crimes, such as robbery, extortion, and murder, as federal
criminal conduct for criminal organizations and networks. The next
Administration can use existing tools while it works with Congress to
develop new tools.

In addition to finalizing the southwestern land border wall, the next
Administration should take a creative and aggressive approach to tackling
these dangerous criminal organizations at the border. This could include
use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist
in arrest operations along the border—something that has not yet been
done. A new and forceful approach to interdiction will have a ripple effect
on the operations of these criminal organizations, which currently operate
freely without concern for criminal prosecution, and will lay the necessary
groundwork for initial prosecutions of these organizations and their leaders.
It is critical that the federal government staunch the flow of drugs by
preventing the far-too-easy access to the United States that now exists.

Secure the border,48 which is the key entry point for many criminal
organizations and their supplies, products, and employees. Mexico—
which is arguably functioning as a failed state run by drug cartels—is
the main point of transit for illegal drugs produced in Central and South
America, fentanyl precursors from the Chinese Communist Party–led
People’s Republic of China,49 weapons, human smuggling and trafficking,
and other contraband. Mexican drug cartels, including the dominant
Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), are the main
drivers of fentanyl production and distribution in the United States. The
southwestern land border is sufficiently porous that Mexican drug cartels
have operational control of large sections of the border, which facilitates
easy movement of product and personnel. These cartels are also violent and
not afraid to demonstrate force on both sides of the border. Their conduct
represents a clear and present danger to the United States and its citizens.
There can be no serious dispute that the Biden Administration has opened
the southwest border to whomever wants to enter and that some of those
entrants are smuggling fentanyl into the country. More than 100,000
Americans died in a one-year period from opioid overdoses, and many of
them died specifically from having used fentanyl.50 The federal government
should treat this problem as aggressively as necessary. Enforcing the
customs and immigration laws is a matter of life and death.


### PURSUING A NATIONAL SECURITY AGENDA AIMED AT EXTERNAL STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS, NOT U.S. CITIZENS EXERCISING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

The Department of Justice plays a vital role in protecting our national security,
and it must not refrain from engaging in public initiatives that identify our adver-
saries and educate the American people about their activities.
The DOJ’s China Initiative under President Trump reflected the department’s
priority of combating Chinese threats to our national security.51 Because China
was accountable for approximately 80 percent of all prosecutions for economic
espionage and approximately 60 percent of all thefts of trade secrets, then-At-
torney General Jeff Sessions set key goals for the China Initiative that included
development of an enforcement strategy concerning researchers in labs and
universities who were being coopted into stealing critical U.S. technologies, iden-
tification of opportunities to address supply-chain threats more effectively, and
education of colleges and universities about potential threats from Chinese influ-
ence efforts on campus.
In February 2022, the Biden Administration terminated the department’s China
Initiative largely out of a concern for poor “optics.”52 While the Biden Administra-
tion correctly identified China as America’s “only competitor with both the intent
to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic,
military, and technological power to do it,”53 it folded in the face of political cor-
rectness and sent the message that liberal sensitivities outweighed bringing justice
to threats from China. The next conservative Administration should therefore:


#### Restart the China Initiative.

Pursue other programs to educate the American people about the
real and dangerous threats to our national security and economic
security that are posed by actors across the globe, most notably
China and Iran.

Ensure that it is agile enough to devote sufficient resources and
attention to other emerging threats that involve federal interests such as increases in “sextortion,” ransomware, and the continued
proliferation of child pornography.
