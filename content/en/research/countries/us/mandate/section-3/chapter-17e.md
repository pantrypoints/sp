<!-- Equal Protection for All Americans by Vigorously Enforcing Applicable Federal Civil Rights Laws in Government, Education, and the
Private Sector. -->

Entities across the private and public sectors in the United States have been besieged in recent years by an unholy alliance of special interests, rad- icals in government, and the far Left. This unholy alliance speaks in platitudes about advancing the interests of certain segments of American society, but that advancement comes at the expense of other Americans and in nearly all cases vio- lates long-standing federal law.

Even though numerous federal laws prohibit discrimination based on notable
immutable characteristics such as race and sex,73 the Biden Administration—
through the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division and other federal entities—has enshrined
affirmative discrimination in all aspects of its operations under the guise of “equity.”
Federal agencies and their components have established so-called diversity, equity,
and inclusion (DEI) offices that have become the vehicles for this unlawful discrim-
ination, and all departments and agencies have created “equity” plans to carry out
these invidious schemes.74 To reverse this trend, the next conservative Adminis-
tration should:

Ensure that the DOJ spearheads an initiative demonstrating the
federal government’s commitment to nondiscrimination. The
department should also lead a whole-of-government recommitment to
nondiscrimination and should be working with all other federal agencies,
boards, and commissions to ensure that they are both complying with
constitutional and legal requirements and using their authorities and
funding to prevent discrimination not only internally, but also at the
state, local, and private-sector levels. This will require particularly close
coordination with several key agencies, including such obvious candidates
as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the Departments
of Defense, Education, and Housing and Urban Development; and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also require enforcing
contractual requirements that prohibit discrimination on federal
contractors.

Reorganize and refocus the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to serve as the
vanguard for this return to lawfulness. The Attorney General and other
DOJ political leadership should provide the resources and moral support
needed for these efforts. The Civil Rights Division should spend its first year
under the next Administration using the full force of federal prosecutorial
resources to investigate and prosecute all state and local governments,
institutions of higher education, corporations, and any other private
employers who are engaged in discrimination in violation of constitutional
and legal requirements.

Announcing a Campaign to Enforce the Criminal Prohibitions in 18 U.S.
Code §§ 1461 and 1462 Against Providers and Distributors of Abortion Pills
That Use the Mail. Federal law prohibits mailing “[e]very article, instrument,
substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner
calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion.”75 Following
the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, there is now no federal prohibition on the
enforcement of this statute. The Department of Justice in the next conservative
Administration should therefore announce its intent to enforce federal law against
providers and distributors of such pills.

Reassigning Responsibility for Prosecuting Election-Related Offenses
from the Civil Rights Division to the Criminal Division. The Attorney Gen-
eral in the next conservative Administration should reassign responsibility for
prosecuting violations of 18 U.S. Code § 24176 from the Civil Rights Division to
the Criminal Division where it belongs. Otherwise, voter registration fraud and
unlawful ballot correction will remain federal election offenses that are never
appropriately investigated and prosecuted.77

This revised guidance addresses the issuance, voting and examination
of provisional ballots under the Election Code. Provisional ballots were
originally mandated by section 302 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002
(HAVA). Provisional ballot amendments included in Act 77 of 2019 went into
effect for the 2020 Primary election. Provisional ballot amendments included
in Act 12 of 2020 go into effect for the first time on November 3, 2020.82
HAVA, however, mandates provisional ballots only for eligible voters who were
not on a state’s voter registration list.83 It does not apply to those who registered
for mail-in voting but whose ballots were rejected due to some form of spoliation.

Voter fraud includes unlawful practices concerning voter registration and ballot
correction. When state legislatures are silent as to procedures for absentee ballot
curing or provide specific rules governing that curing, neither counties nor courts
may create a cure right where one does not exist, may not modify the law on curing,
and certainly cannot engage in creating consent orders with the force of law that
are inconsistent with the orders of other similarly situated counties.

The DOJ has ceded substantial discretion concerning voter suppression to
the Civil Rights Division. Since the Bush Administration, DOJ leadership has
determined that using the Election Crimes Branch to prosecute fraudulent voter
registration, including mail-in ballot fraud, was too politically costly.78 The Crim-
inal Division’s Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses handbook advised that
schemes that violated equal protection constituted “voter suppression” prosecut-
able under 18 U.S. Code § 241 as part of the guidelines for which the department’s
criminal prosecutors were trained.79 State-based investigations of election crimes
are supposed to be referred to the Public Integrity Section for review. Historically,
18 U.S. Code § 241 (conspiracy against rights) was used as a basis for investigating
state officials whose statements or orders violated the equal protection rights of
voters or deliberately misinformed voters concerning the eligibility of their ballots.

Nevertheless, the Department of Justice has formalized the Civil Rights Divi-
sion’s (as opposed to the Criminal Division’s) jurisdiction over 18 U.S. Code § 241
investigations and prosecutions. The Criminal Division is no longer involved in
consultation or review of 18 U.S. Code § 241 investigations.80 The Criminal Division
has accordingly advised states that “[i]n the case of a crime of violence or intimida-
tion,” they should “call 911 immediately and before contacting federal authorities”
because “[s]tate and local police have primary jurisdiction over polling places,”81
despite clearly applicable federal law.

This is a mistake. With respect to the 2020 presidential election, there were no
DOJ investigations of the appropriateness or lawfulness of state election guidance.
Consider the state of Pennsylvania. The Secretary of State sent guidance to the
counties stating that:

Pennsylvania Act 12 (amended in 2020) does not authorize curing by providing
provisional ballots for mail-in voters whose ballots were rejected. Act 12 requires,
as part of the mail-in application process, an affidavit that:

[The elector] shall not be eligible to vote at a polling place on election day
unless the elector brings the elector’s mail-in ballot to the elector’s polling
place, remits the ballot and the envelope containing the declaration of the
elector to the judge of elections to be spoiled and signs a statement subject
to the penalties under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (relating to unsworn falsification to
authorities) to the same effect.84

The law in Pennsylvania clearly states that no county may affirmatively provide
provisional ballots: The mail-in voter must vote in person and sign a new affidavit.
In the 2020 election, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized that “the Election
Code contains no requirement that voters whose ballots are deemed inadequately
verified be apprised of this fact. Thus, unlike in-person voters, mail-in or absentee
voters are not provided any opportunity to cure perceived defects in a timely man-
ner.”85 Given the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s use of guidance to circumvent
state law, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State should have been (and still should be)
investigated and prosecuted for potential violations of 18 U.S. Code § 241.
Investigations and prosecutions under 18 U.S. Code § 241 are currently within
the jurisdictional oversight of the Civil Rights Division, not the Criminal Division.86
Only by moving authority for 18 U.S. Code § 241 investigations and prosecutions
back to the Criminal Division will the rule of law be appropriately enforced.

Rejecting Third-Party Requests for Politically Motivated Investigations
or Prosecutions. The DOJ should reject demands from third-party groups that
ask it to threaten politically motivated investigation or prosecution of those engag-
ing in lawful and, in many cases, constitutionally protected activity. By acceding to
such demands, the department risks diminishing its credibility with the American
public. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that communications between govern-
ment officials and third-party groups are generally unprotected by privilege and
subject to disclosure, whether via subpoena to the third-party group or via request
made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. These communications can
even be made public voluntarily by the third-party group.

A recent example illustrates the risks posed by such activity. On October 4, 2021,
Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memorandum to the Director of the
FBI, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, and the Assistant Attorney General,
Criminal Division, calling on the FBI to work with each U.S. Attorney to “con-
vene meetings with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders” to discuss
strategies for addressing “threats against school administrators, board members,
teachers, and staff.”87 Subsequent reporting and investigation revealed that the memorandum was prompted by a September 29, 2021, letter sent by the National
School Boards Association (NSBA) to President Biden demanding a federal law
enforcement response to perceived threats to school board members and pub-
lic-school employees.

The NSBA letter made outlandish demands in response to protests that were
then occurring at school board meetings in response to COVID policies and revela-
tions about the use of critical race theory–infused curricula in classrooms. Among
the letter’s demands was a call for a federal investigation into parents’ actions (“hei-
nous actions” that “could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and
hate crimes”) under a variety of federal laws including the “Gun-Free Zones Act,
the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism, the Matthew Shepard and
James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes and Prevention Act, the Violent Interference with
Federally Protected Rights statute, and the Conspiracy Against Rights statute”
and “an Executive Order to enforce all applicable federal laws for the protection
of students and public school district personnel, and any related measure.”88
Both the Attorney General’s memorandum and the NSBA letter drew swift
public condemnation, including from 14 sitting state Attorneys General.89 A sub-
sequent internal investigation commissioned by the NSBA revealed that officials
at the White House had been in discussions with NSBA officials about the contents
of the letter weeks before it was issued. The investigation also revealed that White
House officials indicated they planned to raise the contents of the draft letter with
DOJ officials a full week before the NSBA’s letter was issued.90

This cooperation by a third-party group, the White House, and the DOJ to craft
and coordinate a response to an ill-advised and politically motivated letter under-
mines the department’s credibility as an impartial law enforcement agency. In the
words of the 14 state Attorneys General who wrote to oppose the department’s
memorandum, “potential collusion between the White House, the Department,
and the NSBA in the actual creation of the September 29 letter—as a pretext for
threats against parents—raises serious concerns.”91
The DOJ should carefully scrutinize all requests for law enforcement assis-
tance and reject requests by third parties to engage in political grandstanding that
ignores the department’s traditional jurisdictional limits and that would trample
politically controversial but constitutionally protected activity.
