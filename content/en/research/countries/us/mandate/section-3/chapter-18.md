MISSION STATEMENT

OVERVIEW

The labor agencies covered in this chapter include the Department of Labor
(DOL), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the National Mediation Board (NMB), the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC). Congress has provided these agencies with the authority to
enforce a wide range of federal statutes regulating workplace conduct, workforce
development, employee benefits, labor organization and bargaining, and international labor conditions.

At the heart of The Conservative Promise is the resolve to reclaim the role of
each American worker as the protagonist in his or her own life and to restore the
family as the centerpiece of American life. The role that labor policy plays in that
promise is twofold: Give workers the support they need for rewarding, well-paying,
and self-driven careers, and restore the family-supporting job as the centerpiece of
the American economy. The Judeo-Christian tradition, stretching back to Genesis,
has always recognized fruitful work as integral to human dignity, as service to God,
neighbor, and family. And Americans have long been known for their work ethic.

While it is primarily the culture’s responsibility to affirm the dignity of work, our
federal labor and employment agencies have an important role to play by protect-
ing workers, setting boundaries for the healthy functioning of labor markets, and
ultimately encouraging wages and conditions for jobs that can support a family.
In the sweep of American history, these authorities are relatively new. They largely
come from Congress’s attempts in the middle of the 20th century to resolve major
political questions brought about by labor conflict, the civil rights movement, and the
emergence of the modern workplace. The 21st century has brought about new challenges, ranging from collapsing manufacturing sector employment and a decrease in
family-supporting jobs, to the massive expansion of an increasingly radical human-resources bureaucracy. In many cases, these challenges are as significant as the 20th
century labor crises and workplace changes that the agencies were developed to manage.

But the agencies have failed to respond to these challenges. Despite significant
progress by the Trump Administration, a massive administrative state now hangs
over productive industry and labor organization, acting as a damper on social and
economic life. And under the Biden Administration, that administrative state has
imposed the most assertive left-wing social-engineering agenda in the agencies’
history and ratcheted up regulatory costs on small businesses and other productive
industry. The agencies’ authorities have been abused by the Left to favor human
resources bureaucracies, climate-change activists, and union bosses—all against
the interest of American workers.


### NEEDED REFORMS

Reverse the DEI Revolution in Labor Policy. Under the Obama and Biden
Administrations, labor policy was yet another target of the Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion (DEI) revolution. Under this managerialist left-wing race and gender ideol-
ogy, every aspect of labor policy became a vehicle with which to advance race, sex, and
other classifications and discriminate against conservative and religious viewpoints
on these subjects and others, including pro-life views. The next Administration
should eliminate every one of these wrongful and burdensome ideological projects.
Eliminate Racial Classifications and Critical Race Theory Trainings. The
Biden Administration has pushed “racial equity” in every area of our national life,
including in employment, and has condoned the use of racial classifications and
racial preferences under the guise of DEI and critical race theory, which categorizes
individuals as oppressors and victims based on race. Nondiscrimination and equal-
ity are the law; DEI is not. Title VII flatly prohibits discrimination in employment
on the basis of race, color, and national origin. The President should:


Issue an executive order banning, and Congress should pass a law
prohibiting the federal government from using taxpayer dollars to
fund, all critical race theory training (CRT).
Direct DOJ and EEOC to enforce Title VII. The President should
direct the Department of Justice and Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission to enforce Title VII to prohibit racial classifications and quotas, including human-resources classifications and DEI trainings that promote
critical race theory.


Eliminate EEO-1 data collection. The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission collects EEO-1 data on employment statistics based on race/
ethnicity, which data can then be used to support a charge of discrimination
under a disparate impact theory. This could lead to racial quotas to remedy
alleged race discrimination. (The Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs (OFCCP) also has a right to the data EEOC collects.) Crudely
categorizing employees by race or ethnicity fails to recognize the diversity
of the American workforce and forces individuals into categories that do not
fully reflect their racial and ethnic heritage.

Amend Title VII. The next Administration should work with Congress
to amend Title VII to prohibit the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission from collecting EEO-1 data and any other racial classifications
in employment for both private and public workplaces.
Congress should:

Eliminate disparate impact as a valid theory of discrimination for
race and other bases under Title VII and other laws. Disparities do not
(and should not legally) imply discrimination per se.

The President should:

Sign an executive order explicitly forbidding OFCCP from using
disparate impact in its analysis.

Eliminate OFCCP. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
(OFCCP) exists to enforce Executive Order (EO) 11246.2 That order was
originally signed in 1965 to require federal contractors (and subcontractors)
to commit to nondiscrimination. It gave enforcement authority to
the Department of Labor, up to and including debarment from federal
contracting. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has since


Eliminate disparate impact liability. With interracial marriages in
America increasing, many Americans do not fit neatly into crude racial
categories.1 Under disparate impact theory, moreover, discriminatory
motive or intent is irrelevant; the outcome is what matters. But all
workplaces have disparities.

grown, often making OFCCP’s authority redundant and imposing a second
regulatory agency under whose rules businesses must operate. In addition,
under EO 11246, the President and DOL can force a huge swath of American
employers to comply with rules and regulations based on novel anti-
discrimination theories (such as sexual orientation and gender identity
theories) that Congress had never imposed by statute.


Rescind EO 11246. The President should eliminate OFCCP by simply
rescinding EO 11246. Federal contractors would still be bound by statutory
nondiscrimination law but would no longer work under overlapping
regimes. (Contractors’ residual obligations under Section 503 of the
Rehabilitation Act and Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act
(VEVRAA) could be enforced by EEOC or DOL.) Contractors also would be
less subject to the changing political whims of a President that might impose
significant new costs or burdens on the contractors.
Sex Discrimination. The Biden Administration, LGBT advocates, and some
federal courts have attempted to expand the scope and definition of sex discrimi-
nation, based in part on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County.
Bostock held that “an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual
or transgender” violates Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination. The
Court explicitly limited its holding to the hiring/firing context in Title VII and
did not purport to address other Title VII issues, such as bathrooms, locker rooms,
and dress codes, or other laws prohibiting sex discrimination. Notably, the Court
focused on the status of the employees and used the term “transgender status”
rather than the broader and amorphous term “gender identity.”

Restrict the application of Bostock. The new Administration should
restrict Bostock’s application of sex discrimination protections to sexual
orientation and transgender status in the context of hiring and firing.
Withdraw unlawful “notices” and “guidances.” The President should
direct agencies to withdraw unlawful “notices” and “guidances” purporting
to apply Bostock’s reasoning broadly outside hiring and firing.

Rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and
sex characteristics. The President should direct agencies to rescind
regulations interpreting sex discrimination provisions as prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity,
transgender status, sex characteristics, etc.


Direct agencies to refocus enforcement of sex discrimination laws.
The President should direct agencies to focus their enforcement of sex
discrimination laws on the biological binary meaning of “sex.”


### PRO-LIFE MEASURES

Pass a law requiring equal (or greater) benefits for pro-life support
for mothers and clarifying abortion exclusions. Congress should pass a
law requiring that to the extent an employer provides employee benefits for
abortion, it must provide equal or greater benefits for pregnancy, childbirth,
maternity, and adoption. That law should also clarify that no employer is
required to provide any accommodations or benefits for abortion.
Keep anti-life “benefits” out of benefit plans. Some benefits attorneys
and pro-choice advocates have argued since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision6 that the longstanding
doctrine of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)7
preemption should block individual states’ efforts to prohibit employers
from helping employees procure abortions via offering various kinds of
coverage under employee-sponsored benefit plans. ERISA should not be
allowed to trump states’ ability to protect innocent human life in the womb.
Congress and DOL should clarify that ERISA does not preempt states’
power to restrict abortion, surrogacy, or other anti-life “benefits.”
