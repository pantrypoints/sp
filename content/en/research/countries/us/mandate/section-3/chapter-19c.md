Seek to refocus the FHWA on maintaining and improving the highway system.

Remove or reform rules and regulations that hamper state governments.

Reduce the amount of federal involvement in local infrastructure decisions.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has jurisdiction over the inter-
state highway system, which is vital for the transportation of goods and people
throughout the country. The FHWA, in conjunction with state DOTs, works to
ensure the quality and safety of highways and bridges.

However, over the course of decades, presidential Administrations and Con- gress have caused the FHWA to go beyond its original mission. The variety of infrastructure projects now eligible for funding through the FHWA include fer- ryboat terminals, hiking trails, bicycle lanes, and local sidewalks. In many cases, such projects should be the sole responsibility of local or state governments, not dependent on FHWA funding. For local projects, federal involvement adds red tape and bureaucratic delays rather than value.

The Biden Administration has broadened the FHWA’s scope by emphasizing the priorities of progressive activists instead of pursuing practical goals. These policies include a focus on “equity,” a nebulous concept that in practice means awarding grants to favored identity groups, as well as imposing obligations on states concern- ing carbon dioxide emissions from highway traffic—areas not encompassed within FHWA’s statutory authorities.

Furthermore, the Biden Administration’s embrace of the “Vision Zero” approach to safety often means actively seeking congestion for automobiles to reduce speeds. Finally, the Administration has sought to use a “guidance memo” to impose policies not enacted by Congress, most notably to make it harder for growing states to expand highway capacity. Instead, the next Administration should:


### AVIATION

Americans value the ability to travel safely and inexpensively by air. In the
United States, the private sector has developed the world’s safest, most effective
passenger and cargo air transport networks. Current policies threaten to undo that
legacy and to strangle the development of new technologies such as drones and
“advanced air mobility,” including small aircraft to serve as air taxis or to conduct
quiet vertical flights.

Starting in the 1970s, deregulation and increased competition turned air travel
from a luxury to an affordable travel option enjoyed by most Americans. The United
States has four major airlines, each with roughly 20 percent of the domestic market.
They compete with each other over the vast majority of routes. Several smaller
carriers provide additional competition and other options for travelers.
The current Administration’s policies are self-contradictory. In order to pla-
cate specific labor groups, the Biden Administration not only opposes the growth
of the major airlines, which would reduce the price of air travel, but also opposes
measures—such as low-fare foreign competition and joint ventures of smaller U.S.
carriers—that would increase competition.

Another problematic area is aviation consumer protection. Congress has autho-
rized DOT to prohibit specific “unfair and deceptive practices” in the airline industry
after undertaking a hearing process—authority exercised by the Office of Aviation
Consumer Protection within the General Counsel’s Office. Beginning with the Obama
Administration, this authority has been used to justify broad new regulations—in the
name of achieving “fair” competition—that would impose burdensome disclosure
mandates and other costly requirements without a sufficient process for gathering
supporting evidence. The Trump Administration reformed the process for issuing
such “unfair and deceptive practices” rules,9 but the Biden Administration promptly
reversed those reforms.10 A new Administration should restore them.

In general, the next Administration should focus its efforts on making air
travel more affordable and abundant, increasing safety, increasing competition
to benefit the flying public, and removing obstacles to the rapid deployment of
emerging aviation technologies that hold the promise of improved safety, compe-
tition, opportunity, and growth. To achieve a more level playing field and increase
options for the traveling public, the next Administration should:

Publicly indicate that a new Administration would support joint-
venture efforts by smaller carriers (for example, Jet Blue and
Spirit) to achieve scale necessary to reduce costs and compete more
effectively with the larger carriers.

Review foreign ownership and control limitations and, if necessary,
work with Congress to change existing statutes. Worldwide investors are providing access to capital to foreign airlines for innovations and new equipment purchases that U.S. airlines cannot match. The U.S. should
use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
process to keep out nefarious foreign actors while allowing investment
from investors in designated like-minded countries so long as U.S.-based
investors maintain plurality ownership.

Establish a New Entry Initiative that commits the federal
government to approving or rejecting the applications of new air
carriers within 12 months.

Initiate a rulemaking to allocate slot-pairs more consistently to
airlines at capacity-controlled airports on the primary basis of safety,
maximizing capacity, and competition.

In a perfect world, the market would dictate these options, but in the highly
regulated international aviation sector, the current incentives are to keep out com-
petitors. Slot regulations have not been updated since the 1990s.
Well-meaning legislation and the pilot shortage are adversely affecting aviation
safety. In the wake of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash, all commercial pilots and
copilots were required to have 1,500 flight hours. Today, facing a pilot shortage,
larger and safer twin-engine planes with two pilots are being phased out of service
at smaller airports and replaced by single-engine planes that have only one pilot.
This trend could be reversed if copilots were required to have fewer flight hours
or could count certified simulator training.

Federal subsidies are also distorting the commercial market. The Essential
Air Service (EAS) program subsidizes flights to 200 small airports that are not
otherwise commercially viable. The program was established in the 1970s as a
temporary measure to cushion deregulation. It has since been made permanent.
Finally ending the program would free hundreds of pilots to serve larger markets
with more passengers. A new Administration could reform regulations to encour-
age airports in lower-served areas of the nation.

International air travel is regulated and restricted by individual treaties between
the United States and other countries. The new Administration should remain
committed to the laudatory goal of “Open Skies.” However, many of the largest
emerging markets are not fully open, and our aviation policies should reflect that
reality and ensure that U.S. air carriers compete on a level playing field. Specifically,
so long as U.S. carriers are not able to fly over Russian airspace, the U.S. should not
allow foreign carriers serving markets in East Asia and South Asia to enjoy a com-
petitive advantage by continuing to allow them to fly to the U.S. China has failed to
put in place several of the policies to which it has already agreed; the U.S. should
not offer additional negotiations until the Chinese implement the agreements
they have already signed.

The current Administration’s policies in several areas that affect aviation and
limit America’s future opportunities for growth are internally inconsistent. In
addition to a New Entry Initiative, the new Administration should establish an
interagency clearinghouse to drive consistent policies across the government on
spectrum, drones, and advanced air mobility.
