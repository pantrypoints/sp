With a budget of $18.6 billion requested for FY 202311 and an international regulatory footprint, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is DOT’s most visible mode. It needs reform. Air traffic control (ATC) operations account for two-thirds of FAA’s budget, and the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is far behind its counterparts in Australia, Canada, and Western Europe in implementing 21st century technology. The FAA’s primary mission is ATC; its two smaller functions are distributing federal airport grants and regulating all aspects of aviation safety.

The FAA was once considered the world’s best government aviation agency.

Those days are long past. In the more than five decades since 1958 when the Federal Aviation Agency (precursor to the Federal Aviation Administration) was formed, there have been notable developments in air traffic control technology, aircraft avionics, and engine reliability, but despite many well-intentioned attempts, there have been few changes in the FAA’s funding structure. The FAA is still improperly organized and financed, and the management reforms provided in the late 1990s remain largely unused.

The FAA is 10 years older than DOT. It provides two separate and functionally different services: the world’s largest and most complex Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and, at the same time, the world’s largest civil aviation regulatory and certificatory agency. The first is a 24/7/365 air traffic service provider. The second is an inherently governmental organization responsible for ensuring that aerospace operators, vehicles, airports, and ANSPs are properly certified and follow all FAA regulations.

These two different organizations ought to run separately. The FAA is the only modern Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the world that does not assess fees for its services. Its funding structure, subject to the annual appropriations process, stifles efficiency and innovation—and the FAA does not innovate well. It spends too much time and money on research and development (R&D) and is not very good at either one. It should get out of the R&D business and focus on testing, evaluating, and certifying private-sector innovation much more quickly than it does today.

The FAA workforce needs to modernize. The agency needs safety and certifi-
cation experts, not professional airframe and powerplant mechanics (A&Ps). It needs to hire people trained to oversee mechanics, engineers, and pilots. It is time to consider promoting the FAA’s top executive team from within and requiring
strict professional requirements for its top appointees. Organizations such as the
FAA whose sole responsibility is public safety should be fully auditable and led by
experts in their field or industry with oversight from DOT leadership.

For 60 years, the FAA was the global leader in aerospace, from general aviation
to commercial space, but the U.S. lead has vanished. The FAA’s overly bureaucratic,
legalistic, byzantine, and more recently hyperpoliticized way of processing regu-
lations, adopting innovation, publishing rules, and procuring new technologies
has been eclipsed by foreign CAAs and ANSPs that are eagerly certifying drones
and creating environments in which new technologies and new entrants, such as
air taxis, can thrive. To regain America’s global leadership in aviation, the next
Administration should:

Separate the FAA from DOT or, at a minimum, separate the ATO from the FAA.

Completely restructure the FAA’s funding system so that the nation’s
aviation system is not held prisoner to annual appropriations or used
as a political football to solve nonaviation problems.

Require the FAA to operate more like a business. The FAA has not made
good use of the unique authority it has been given in areas like personnel
and acquisition.

In Europe, conventional control towers are being replaced by digital/remote
towers with high-resolution cameras and other sensors on tall structures and at
points adjoining runways. In Germany and Scandinavia, as many as 15 small air-
ports can be controlled from one remote tower center. The FAA has yet to certify
a single digital/remote tower.

Text messaging between controllers and pilots is widespread over the oceans.
The ATO began to implement what is now called DataComm in 2002 but sus-
pended the project in 2003. This was restarted at airport control towers in 2016,
but as of October 2022, it was available in only seven of the 20 high-altitude
control centers.

Current technology enables flights to be managed “anywhere from anywhere,”
but the ATO resists consolidating its 20 aging centers into a much smaller
number—and lacks the funds to consolidate them. The FAA as regulator and
the ATO as traffic manager have no plans in place to handle millions of drones
and other emerging technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing
(eVTOL) aircraft.

These shortcomings have been documented over many decades by the Govern- ment Accountability Office and DOT Inspector General. One peer-reviewed study for the Hudson Institute by scholar Robert Poole identified the ATO’s underlying problems as including an overly cautious culture, a growing lack of technological and managerial expertise, the inability to finance major capital projects with rev- enue bonds, and overdependence on aerospace/defense contractors.12

All of these problems are interrelated. Because of the ATO’s lack of top-notch engineers and program managers, it has become dependent on aerospace contrac- tors, unlike counterparts in Canada and the United Kingdom. Operating within the constraints imposed by the annual congressional appropriations process—and with no bonding authority—the ATO is forced to implement major projects piecemeal over many years. The ATO’s overly cautious culture appears to stem from its being embedded in a safety regulatory agency rather than being regulated at arm’s length (as are airlines and airports).

Three organizational changes, all requiring legislation, offer the likelihood of
dealing with these problems based on the experiences of air traffic providers in
Canada and Europe. They could be implemented one at a time or together.
Separate the ATO from the FAA and relocate it to separate
headquarters outside the District of Columbia.


Shift from aviation user taxes to fees for air traffic services paid directly to the ATO.

Allow the ATO to issue long-term revenue bonds for major projects.
Shorter-term reforms could include implementing user fees for unconventional
airspace users (for example, advanced air mobility, space launch, and recovery)
and giving the ATO a deadline after which it could not authorize or fund any more
nondigital/remote control towers. These reforms would also require legislation.


## FEDERAL TRANSIT POLICY

The definition of “mobility” continues to evolve dramatically with the rise of
new multimodal concepts, traveler needs, and emerging capabilities. These fun-
damental changes in the way transportation services are offered also influence the
form of our communities.

New micromobility solutions, ridesharing, and a possible future that includes
autonomous vehicles mean that mobility options—particularly in urban areas—
can alter the nature of public transit, making it more affordable and flexible for
Americans. Unfortunately, DOT now defines public transit only as transit provided by municipal governments. This means that when individuals change their commutes from urban buses to rideshare or electric scooter, the use of public
transit decreases. A better definition for public transit (which also would require
congressional legislation) would be transit provided for the public rather than
transit provided by a public municipality.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a substantial decline in usage for all forms of
transportation. Mass transit has been the slowest mode to recover, with October
2022 ridership reaching only 64 percent of the level seen in October 2019. The
sustained increase in remote work has caused changes in commuting patterns.

Since facilitating travel for workers is one of the core functions of mass transit
systems, a permanent reduction in commuting raises questions about the viability
of fixed-route mass transit, especially considering that transit systems required
substantial subsidization before the pandemic.

Regrettably, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act13 authorized tens
of billions of dollars for the expansion of transit systems even as Americans were
moving away from them and into personal vehicles. Lower revenue from reduced
ridership is already driving transit agencies to a budgetary breaking point, and
added operational costs from system expansions will make this problem worse.
The Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program is another example of Washing-
ton’s tendency to fund transit expansion rather than maintaining or improving
current facilities. The CIG program, which began in 1991, funds only novel transit
projects. These can include new rail lines (regardless of the demand for preexisting
rail in the area) and costly operations such as streetcars.

Because Americans have demonstrated a strong preference for alternative means of transportation, rather than throwing good money after bad by continuing federal subsidies for transit expansion, there should be a focus on reducing costs that make transit uneconomical.

The Trump Administration urged Congress to eliminate the CIG program, but the program has strong support on Capitol Hill. At a minimum, a new conservative Administration should ensure that each CIG project meets sound economic standards and a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. The largest expense in transit operational budgets is labor.

Compensation costs for transit workers exceed both regional and sector compensation averages. This is driven by generous pension and health benefits rather than by exorbitant wages. Since workers value wages more than they value fringe benefits, this has led to a perverse situation in which transit agencies have high compensation costs yet are struggling to attract workers.

The next Administration can remove the largest obstacle to reforming labor
costs. Section 10(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 196414 was initially
intended to protect bargaining rights for workers in privately owned transit sys-
tems that were being absorbed by government-operated agencies. The provision
has mutated into a requirement that any transit agency receiving federal funds
cannot reduce compensation, an interpretation that far exceeds the original statute.
Returning to the original intent would allow transit agencies to adjust fringe ben-
efits without fearing a federal lawsuit.

It is also vital to move away from using the Highway Trust Fund to prop up
mass transit. The fund was driven into insolvency (and repeated bailouts) through
decades of transfers to transit without any increase in transit usage to show for it.
With the federal government facing mounting debt, the best course of action would
be to remove federal subsidies for transit spending, allowing states and localities
to decide whether mass transit is a good investment for them.
