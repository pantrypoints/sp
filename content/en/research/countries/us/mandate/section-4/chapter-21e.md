### Break Up NOAA

The single biggest Department of Commerce agency outside of decennial census years is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and other components. NOAA garners $6.5 billion of the department’s $12 billion annual operational budget and accounts for more than half of the department’s personnel in non-decadal Census years (2021 figures). NOAA consists of six main offices:

- The National Weather Service (NWS);
- The National Ocean Service (NOS);
- The Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR);
- The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS);
- The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); and
- The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and NOAA Corps.


Together, these form a colossal operation that has become one of the main
drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future
U.S. prosperity. This industry’s mission emphasis on prediction and management
seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable. That is
not to say NOAA is useless, but its current organization corrupts its useful func-
tions. It should be broken up and downsized.

NOAA today boasts that it is a provider of environmental information services,
a provider of environmental stewardship services, and a leader in applied scientific
research. Each of these functions could be provided commercially, likely at lower
cost and higher quality.

Focus the NWS on Commercial Operations. Each day, Americans rely on
weather forecasts and warnings provided by local radio stations and colleges that
are produced not by the NWS, but by private companies such as AccuWeather.
Studies have found that the forecasts and warnings provided by the private com-
panies are more reliable than those provided by the NWS.2
The NWS provides data the private companies use and should focus on its
data-gathering services. Because private companies rely on these data, the NWS
should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.

NOAA does not currently utilize commercial partnerships as some other
agencies do. Commercialization of weather technologies should be prioritized
to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested in the most cost-efficient technol-
ogies for high quality research and weather data. Investing in different sizes of
commercial partners will increase competition while ensuring that the govern-
ment solutions provided by each contract is personalized to the needs of NOAA’s
weather programs.

The NWS should be a candidate to become a Performance-Based Organization
to better enforce organizational focus on core functions such as efficient delivery
of accurate, timely, and unbiased data to the public and to the private sector.3
Review the Work of the National Hurricane Center and the National
Environmental Satellite Service. The National Hurricane Center and National
Environmental Satellite Service data centers provide important public safety and﻿

business functions as well as academic functions, and are used by forecasting agen-
cies and scientists internationally. Data continuity is an important issue in climate
science. Data collected by the department should be presented neutrally, without
adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate.
Transfer NOS Survey Functions to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey. Survey operations have historically accounted for almost half the
NOS budget. These functions could be transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S.
Geological Survey to increase efficiency. NOS’ expansion of the National Marine
Sanctuaries System should also be reviewed, as discussed below.
Streamline NMFS. Overlap exists between the National Marine Fisheries
Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Overly simplified, the NMFS handles
saltwater species while the Fish and Wildlife Service focuses on fresh water. The
goals of these two agencies should be streamlined.

Harmonize the Magnuson–Stevens Act with the National Marine Sanctuaries
Act. Under the auspices of NOS, marine sanctuaries (including no-fishing zones)
are being established country-wide, often conflicting with the goals of the Magnu-
son–Stevens Act fisheries management authorities of NOAA Fisheries, regional
fishery management councils, and relevant states.

Withdraw the 30x30 Executive Order and Associated America the Beautiful Ini-
tiative. The 30x30 Executive Order and the American the Beautiful Initiative are
being used to advance an agenda to close vast areas of the ocean to commercial
activities, including fishing, while rapidly advancing offshore wind energy devel-
opment to the detriment of fisheries and other existing ocean-based industries.
Modify Regulations Implementing the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the
Endangered Species Act. These acts are currently being abused at a cost to fisheries
and Native American subsistence activities around the U.S.

Allow a NEPA Exemption for Fisheries Actions. All the requirements for robust
analysis of the biological, economic, and social impacts of proposed regulatory
action in fisheries are contained with the Magnuson–Stevens Act, the guiding Act
for fisheries. NEPA overlays these requirements with onerous, redundant, and
time-consuming process requirements, which routinely cause unnecessary delays
in the promulgation of timely fisheries management actions. The Department
of Commerce and the Council on Environmental Quality should collaborate to
reduce this redundancy.

Downsize the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. OAR provides
theoretical science, as opposed to the applied science of the National Hurricane
Center. OAR is, however, the source of much of NOAA’s climate alarmism. The
preponderance of its climate-change research should be disbanded. OAR is a large
network of research laboratories, an undersea research center, and several joint
research institutes with universities. These operations should be reviewed with
an aim of consolidation and reduction of bloat.


Break Up the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and Reassign Its Assets to Other Agencies During This Process. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, which provides the ships and planes used by NOAA agencies,
should be broken up and its assets reassigned to the General Services Administra-
tion or to other agencies.

Use Small Innovation Prizes and Competitions to Encourage High-Qual-
ity Research. Lowering the barriers of entry for startups and small businesses will
also provide greater innovation without excessive increases in spending. Reaching
beyond traditional partnerships for innovative engagement tools that encourage
entrepreneurial innovation will allow NOAA’s research programs to adapt more
quickly to the world’s changing needs. Multiple competitions should take place in
cities to attract a variety of innovators and investors to propel innovation forward
in a way that benefits the needs of NOAA.

Ensure Appointees Agree with Administration Aims. Scientific agencies
like NOAA are vulnerable to obstructionism of an Administration’s aims if political
appointees are not wholly in sync with Administration policy. Particular attention
must be paid to appointments in this area.

Elevate the Office of Space Commerce. The Office of Space Commerce is
the executive branch advocate on behalf of the U.S. commercial space industry.
This office should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and
unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. lead-
ership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.

The Office’s current
mission has been lost owing to its position within NESDIS, which sees no role
for itself in advancing the industry and the space economy, including ensuring
global competitiveness. OSC is, by law, the Department of Commerce’s lead on
space policy and must therefore link directly to all the bureaus and other orga-
nizations within the department. The Office needs to be returned to OS, within
which it existed for the first two decades of its existence. From OS, the Office
could serve as a coordinating entity for the whole-of-government commercial
space policy desperately needed to secure America’s place as the global leader
in commercial space operations.

There presently exists no unified U.S. government policy on commercial space
operations, with the Federal Communications Commission largely responsible
for establishing space policy by default through its regulation of radio spectrum
licenses. Now that routine space operations are commercially viable, it is critical
that a new Administration establish reasonable government policies that ensure
the U.S. will continue to be the flag of choice for commercial space activities. The
President should, by executive order, direct the Office of Space Commerce, working
with the National Space Council, to establish a whole-of-government policy for
licensing and oversight of commercial space operations.
