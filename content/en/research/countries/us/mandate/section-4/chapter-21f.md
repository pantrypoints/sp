The Office of the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs is charged with:
- conducting economic analysis
- promoting business and commerce
- guiding data-driven decision-making and evidence-building activities
- increasing access to government data while ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

The office coordinates economic analysis needs across the Department of Commerce, leads the department’s initiatives and programs related to data, data policy, and data management, and provides policy direction and oversight for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Census Bureau.

In addition to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, key staff roles in the office include the Chief Economist and the Chief Data Officer. 

The office could be an effective tool for a new Administration if it focuses its efforts on supporting the Department’s mission to ensure the conditions for eco- nomic growth and opportunity—conducting economic analysis and producing data for key departmental policy initiatives, as well as working across agencies to support broader Administration goals.

As the office charged with providing policy direction and oversight for BEA and the Census Bureau, new leadership should take an early and active role within both bureaus.

BEA is a federal statistical agency under the Office of the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs. BEA’s mission is to promote a better understanding of the U.S. economy by providing timely, relevant, and accurate economic accounts data in an objective manner. BEA is responsible for producing economic indicators such as the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), state and local GDP estimates, foreign trade and investment statistics, industry data, and consumer spending numbers. The data produced by BEA are used by government and business decision-makers to understand the state of the nation’s economy. A new Administration should ensure that BEA conducts its statistical analysis in a consistent and objective manner, with the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs taking a strong interest in BEA’s operations and data products.

A new Administration should also study the feasibility of merging all statistical
agencies (Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Department of
Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.) under one bureau to increase efficiency
and better coordinate cross-departmental issues.


## CENSUS BUREAU

The Census Bureau’s core mission is to execute the executive branch’s constitu-
tional mandate to conduct a census every 10 years, but its activities have steadily
grown and shifted to include the economic census, American Communities Survey,
and further functions outside of its core mission.

An incoming conservative Administration should focus on 3 areas: 

1. Day-to-day management
2. The decennial census
3. Other programs

Each of these will need to be addressed at every stage of the transition and policy implementation process and will require that both committed political appointees and like-minded career employees are in immediately put in place to execute a conservative agenda.
These will need to be placed both in the Census Bureau and in key department-level
managerial positions, such as those in the CFO/ASA’s office.


### Day-to-Day Management

Financial management, information technology, and human
resources. The new Administration must immediately conduct a review
to identify ways to better control costs and reverse recent failures of
investments intended to upgrade the financial management, information
technology, and human resources systems of the Census Bureau.
Leveraging technology. The Census Bureau should focus on continuing
to incorporate technology into its day-to-day operations, as well as the
execution of its surveys, to reduce costs and provide more accurate and
timely data to the American public.

Prioritizing cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.
Because much of the data collected by the Census Bureau include personal
and confidential information, a focus on protecting data and implementing
proper data protocols is necessary to ensure compliance with the legal
requirements of Title 13.

Decennial Census

Fully vet existing planning and budgeting from Day One. Planning
and budgets for the 2030 decennial census will be finalized in fall 2025,
including many decisions on how to use, develop, and administer the count.
An incoming Administration should immediately audit the lifecycle cost
estimate (LCCE) for the 2030 census and conduct a new LCCE if necessary.
This will ensure that budget requests are accurate and up-to-date and


Command and control. Strong political leadership is needed to increase
efficiency and align the Census Bureau’s mission with conservative
principles. Personnel is key to ensuring that a new Administration can guide
preparations for the 2030 census and oversee the continued operation
of the Bureau’s many surveys. To move bureaucracy on key priorities,
appointed staff should be in place at the Bureau as early as feasible after
a new President takes office. This will require the Office of Personnel
Management to allocate additional political appointee positions to the
Census Bureau.

allow the new Administration to understand the decennial process in
greater detail.

Review the partnership program. This program, designed to promote
responsiveness to the census by employing trusted voices in various
communities, deserves careful scrutiny. A new Administration should work
to actively engage with conservative groups and voices to promote response
to the decennial census. Promoting response to the decennial census will
ensure that the most accurate counts are conducted, leading to a more
accurate apportionment of congressional representation and allocation
of federal funds. In 2020, lack of conservative participation was one factor
in an undercount in some areas of the country, affecting representation of
certain states.


Remove duplicative functions to increase efficiency. As part of the
above review, ensure the decennial operational plan eliminates current
duplication among ongoing census operations (annual surveys, etc.) and
decennial operations in information technology, human resources, etc. This
overlap has been estimated to waste billions of dollars in the years leading
up to each decennial census.

Add a citizenship question. Despite finding that the Trump
Administration’s addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 decennial
census violated the Administrative Procedures Act, the Supreme Court
held that the Secretary of Commerce does have broad authority to add a
citizenship question to the decennial census. Any successful conservative
Administration must include a citizenship question in the census. Asking a
citizenship question is considered best practice even by the United Nations.
By law, the Census Bureau must deliver the decennial census subjects/
topics to Congress three years before Census Day (in this case, by April 1,
2027). Questions must be presented to Congress two years before Census
Day (April 1, 2028).

Review forthcoming changes to race and ethnicity questions. The
current Administration has announced its intent to change data collection
methods regarding race and ethnicity by combining the two questions
on the decennial questionnaire and increasing the number of available
options. A new conservative Administration should take control of this
process and thoroughly review any changes. There are concerns among
conservatives that the data under Biden Administration proposals could be
skewed to bolster progressive political agendas. Government data should be


unbiased and trusted—and an incoming conservative Administration should
ensure that is the case. This work must be coordinated with the Office of
Management and Budget, which governs federal data collection standards
via its statistical directives.
l
Reevaluate all decennial census questions. Determine how best to
optimize use of the decennial census to determine whether current or
additional questions provide added value in coordination with other
departments that utilize the information. Overly intrusive questions or less
crucial data should either be moved to another survey or removed from
Census programs entirely.

Other Census Programs


The Economic Census. This is the official five-year measurement of
American business and the economy. The first Economic Census in a new
Administration will take place in 2027 and have a major effect on federal
spending and policy determinations. This survey collects business data that
are a key input for ongoing government statistics such as BEA’s GDP reports.
As with the decennial census and ACS, it should be carefully examined
to ensure the Economic Census is not overly intrusive. Additionally, the
Census Bureau should work with other federal agencies to determine
when data collection can be supplemented by industry and other federal
business indicators.

Pulse surveys. During the government’s early response to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Census Bureau began experimental pulse surveys. These
were designed to obtain data closer to real-time than typical census surveys.
These data could be a useful tool to the Department of Commerce and
other partners across government and provide a model for improving data
collection techniques or reducing the overall footprint of the Census Bureau.


The American Communities Survey. After the decennial census, the next
biggest statistical survey conducted by the Census Bureau is the American
Communities Survey (ACS). As with the decennial census, each question
should be carefully reviewed to ensure the data are useful and that the
questions are not overly intrusive. There should be collaboration with other
departments that use the information collected on these surveys (e.g., the
Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security,
etc.) to determine how to optimize the use and collection of particular
information.


Supplemental Poverty Measure. The Census Bureau should review the
Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to consider whether it provides an
accurate measure for use by the Council of Economic Advisers and others.
The findings from this review should also be taken into consideration when
constructing the Current Survey and other supplemental surveys, so that
the SPM can be better tracked on a trend basis and support better policy
decisions over time. This information would be particularly helpful in
determining how to combat homelessness in conjunction with Department
of Health and Human Services programs.

Abolish the National Advisory Committee and reevaluate all other
committees. The Census Bureau National Advisory Committee on Racial,
Ethnic, and Other Populations (NAC) was established by the Obama
Administration in 2012 and rechartered by the Biden Administration in
2022. The committee is a hotbed for left-wing activists intent upon injecting
racial and social-justice theory into the governing philosophy of the Census
Bureau. The NAC should immediately be abolished by the incoming
Administration. The NAC charter gives the Secretary of Commerce the
authority to terminate the committee. Since the Secretary of Commerce
established the NAC in 2012 under the FACA, the Secretary is authorized
to terminate the NAC. The new Administration should also reevaluate
and potentially abolish all non-statutory standing committees within the
Census Bureau, including the Census Scientific Advisory Committee.
