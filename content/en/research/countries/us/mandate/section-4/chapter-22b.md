Tax reform should improve incentives to work, save, and invest by:

- reducing marginal tax rates
- reducing the cost of capital
- broadening the tax base to eliminate tax-induced economic distortions by eliminating special-interest tax credits, deductions, and exclusions.

Tax compliance costs will decline precipitously if the tax system is substantially simplified.15 The Treasury Department should also promote tax competition rather than supporting an international tax cartel.


## Principles of Good Tax Policy

1. The tax system should raise the revenue necessary to fund a limited government.

It should raise this revenue such that it:
- (a) applies the least economically destructive forms of taxation
- b) has low tax rates on a broad, neutral tax base
- c) minimizes interference with the operation of the free market and free enterprise
- d) minimizes the cost to taxpayers of compliance with and administration of the tax system.


2. The tax system should minimize its adverse impact on the family and the core institutions of civil society.

3. The tax system should be applied consistently—with special privileges for none—and respect taxpayer due process and privacy rights.

The current tax system is inconsistent with these principles and needs to be reformed to promote prosperity, reduce compliance costs, and improve fairness.  

The incoming Administration should promote immediate intermediate reforms to the existing system. It should then pursue fundamental tax reform.


### Intermediate Tax Reform.

The Treasury should work with Congress to simplify the tax code by enacting a simple two-rate individual tax system of 15 percent and 30 percent that eliminates most deductions, credits and exclusions. The 30 percent bracket should begin at or near the Social Security wage base to ensure the combined income and payroll tax structure acts as a nearly flat tax on wage income beyond the standard deduction. 

The corporate income tax rate should be reduced to 18 percent. The corporate income tax is the most damaging tax in the U.S. tax system, and its primary economic burden falls on workers because capital is more mobile than labor.17 Capital gains and qualified dividends should be taxed at 15 percent.

Thus, the combined corporate income tax combined with the capital gains or qualified dividends tax rate would be roughly equal to the top individual income tax rate.18 The system should allow immediate expensing for capital expenditures and index capital gains taxes for inflation.

In addition, intermediate tax reform should repeal all tax increases that were passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act,19 including the book minimum tax, the stock buyback excise tax, the coal excise tax, the reinstated Superfund tax, and excise taxes on drug manufacturers to compel them to comply with Medicare price controls. The next Administration should also push for legislation to fully repeal recently passed subsidies in the tax code, including the dozens of credits and tax breaks for green energy companies in Subtitle D of the Inflation Reduction Act.20


Universal Savings Accounts. All taxpayers should be allowed to contribute up to $15,000 (adjusted for inflation) of post-tax earnings into Universal Savings Accounts (USAs). The tax treatment of these accounts would be comparable to Roth IRAs. USAs should be highly flexible to allow Americans to save and invest as they see fit, including, for example, investments in a closely held business. Gains from investments in USAs would be non-taxable and could be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. This would allow the vast majority of American families to save and invest without facing a punitive double layer of taxation.

Entrepreneurship. To encourage entrepreneurship, the business loss limitation should be increased to at least $500,000. Businesses should also be allowed to fully carry forward net operating losses. Extra layers of taxes on investment and capital should also be eliminated or reduced. The net investment income surtax and the base erosion anti-abuse tax should be eliminated. The estate and gift tax should be reduced to no higher than 20 percent, and the 2017 tax bill’s temporary increase in the exemption amount from $5.5 million to $12.9 million (adjusted for inflation) should be made permanent.21 The tax on global intangible low-taxed income should be reduced to no higher than 12.5 percent, with the 20 percent haircut on related foreign tax credits reduced or eliminated.22

All non-business tax deductions and exemptions that were temporarily sus- pended by the 2017 tax bill should be permanently repealed, including the bicycle commuting expense exclusion, non-military moving expense deductions, and the miscellaneous itemized deductions.23 The individual state and local tax deduction, which was temporarily capped at $10,000, should be fully repealed. Deductions related to educational expenses should be repealed. Special business tax pref- erences, such as a special deduction for energy-efficient commercial building properties, should be eliminated.24

Wages vs. Benefits. The current tax code has a strong bias that incentivizes
businesses to offer employees more generous benefits and lower wages. This limits
the freedom of workers and their families to spend their compensation as they
see fit—and it can trap workers in their current jobs due to the jobs’ benefit pack-
ages. Wage income is taxed under the individual income tax and under the payroll
tax. However, most forms of non-wage benefits are wholly exempt from both of
these taxes.

To reduce this tax bias against wages (as opposed to employee benefits), the next Administration should set a meaningful cap (no higher than $12,000 per year per full-time equivalent employee—and preferably lower) on untaxed benefits that employers can claim as deductions. Employee benefit expenses other than tax-deferred retirement account contributions should count toward the limita- tion, whether offered to specific employees or whether the costs relate to a shared benefit like building gym facilities for employees.25 Tax-deferred retirement con- tributions by employers should not count toward this limitation insofar as they are fully taxable upon distribution. Only a percentage of Health Savings Accounts (HSA) contributions (which are not taxed upon withdrawal) should count toward the limitation.26 The limitation on benefit deductions should not be indexed to increase with inflation.27 Employers should also be denied deductions for health insurance and other benefits provided to employee dependents if the dependents are aged 23 or older.

Fundamental Tax Reform. Achieving fundamental tax reform offers the
prospect of a dramatic improvement in American living standards and an equally
dramatic reduction in tax compliance costs. Lobbyists, lawyers, benefit consul-
tants, accountants, and tax preparers would see their incomes decline, however.
The federal income tax system heavily taxes capital and corporate income and
discourages work, savings, and investment.

The public finance literature is clear that a consumption tax would minimize
government’s distortion of private economic decisions and thus be the least eco-
nomically harmful way to raise federal tax revenues.28 There are several forms that
a consumption tax could take, including a national sales tax, a business transfer
tax, a Hall–Rabushka flat tax,29 or a cash flow tax.30

Supermajority to Raise Taxes. Treasury should support legislation instituting
a three-fifths vote threshold in the U.S. House and the Senate to raise income or
corporate tax rates to create a wall of protection for the new rate structure. Many
states have implemented such a supermajority vote requirement.

Tax Competition. Tax competition between states and countries is a positive
force for liberty and limited government.31 The Biden Administration, under the
direction of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has pushed for a global minimum
corporate tax that would increase taxation and the size of government in the U.S.
and around the world. This attempt to “harmonize” global tax rates is an attempt
to create a global tax cartel to quash tax competition and to increase the tax burden
globally. The U.S. should not outsource its tax policy to international organizations.
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with the European Union, has long tried to end financial privacy and impose regulations on countries with low (or no) income taxes. In fact, on tax, environmental, corpo- rate governance and employment issues, the OECD has become little more than a taxpayer-funded left-wing think tank and lobbying organization.32 The United States provides about one-fifth of OECD’s funding.33 The U.S. should end its finan- cial support and withdraw from the OECD.


### Tax Administration

The Internal Revenue Service is a poorly managed, utterly unresponsive and
increasingly politicized agency, and has been for at least two decades. It is time for
meaningful reform to improve the efficiency and fairness of tax administration,
better protect taxpayer rights, and achieve greater transparency and accountability.
A substantial number of the problems attributed to the IRS are actually a function
of congressional action that has made the Internal Revenue Code ridiculously
complex, imposed tremendous administrative burdens on both the public and the
IRS, and given massive non-tax missions to the IRS. But the culture, administrative
practices, and management at the IRS need to change.


Doubling the IRS? The Inflation Reduction Act contains a radical $80 billion
expansion of the IRS—enough to double the size of its workforce.34 Unless Congress
reverses this policy, the IRS will become much more intrusive and impose still
greater costs on the American people.

The Biden Administration has also sought to make the tax system’s adminis-
trative burden much worse in other ways. For example, it has proposed creating a
comprehensive financial account information reporting regime that would apply to
all business and personal accounts with more than $600. Banks would be required
to collect the taxpayer identification numbers of and file a revised Form 1099-K
for all affected payees, as well as provide additional information.35 This massive
increase in the scope and breadth of information reporting should be unequivo-
cally opposed.

### Management

The IRS has approximately 81,000 employees.36 Of those, only two are presidential appointments—the Commissioner and the Chief Counsel.37 As a practical matter, it is impossible for these two officials to overcome bureau- cratic inertia and to implement policy changes that the IRS bureaucracy wants to impede. That is why, notwithstanding decades of sound and fury, almost nothing has changed at the IRS.

For the IRS to change and become more accountable, more transparent, and better managed, there is a need to increase the number of Presidential appoint- ments subject to Senate confirmation, and not subject to Senate confirmation, at the IRS. At the very least, Congress should ensure that the Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support, the National Taxpayer Advocate, the Commissioner of the Wage and Investment Division, the Commissioner of the Large Business and International Division, the Commissioner of the Small Business Self-Employed Division, and the Com- missioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division are presidential appointees.38


### Information Technology

Despite the investment of billions of dollars for at least two decades, IRS information technology (IT) systems remain deficient.39 The IRS inadequately protects taxpayer information, its IT systems do not ade- quately support operations or taxpayer services, and its matching and detection algorithms are antiquated.

These problems are not primarily about resources. The IRS has spent approxi- mately $27 billion on IT during the past decade, with $7 billion of that designated as “development, modernization and enhancement.“40 The problem is one of man- agement. The bureaucracy is not up to the task, and neither Congress nor a long line of IRS commissioners has forced changes.

A Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support with strong IT management skills should be appointed by the IRS Commissioner or the President (once the position is made a presidential appointment). The various subordinates to the Deputy Commissioner should be replaced. A thorough review of IT contracts should be conducted. The Integrated Modernization Business Plan41 should be systematically reviewed and a version of it cost-effectively implemented. An over- sight board composed of private sector IT experts should be established and given the authority to conduct meaningful, contemporaneous oversight.
