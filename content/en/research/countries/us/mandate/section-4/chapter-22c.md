Legal protections for taxpayer rights and privacy have improved during the past three decades, but they remain inadequate.42 

Congress should do more. For example, interest on overpayments should be the same as interest on underpayments rather than the government receiving a higher rate, the time limit for taxpayers to sue for damages for improper collection actions should be extended, the juris- diction of the Tax Court should be expanded, and the tax penalty system should be reformed by rationalizing the penalty structure and reducing some of the most punitive penalties.43

The Office of the Taxpayer Advocate was created by Congress to assist taxpay- ers when the IRS bureaucracy is unresponsive or negligent. About 1.7 percent of the IRS budget goes to this function.44 Each year, the Office handles more than 250,000 cases, helping taxpayers to deal with the IRS. Each year, it issues nearly 2000 taxpayer assistance orders, a form of administrative injunction, forcing the rest of the IRS to stop taking unwarranted actions.45 Congress should provide the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate with greater resources so that it may better assist taxpayers suffering from wrongful IRS actions. The office should also be strengthened by, among other things:

- Ensuring that the National Taxpayer Advocate can make his or her own personnel decisions to protect its independence;
- Ensuring NTA access to files, meetings, and other information needed to assist taxpayers or investigate IRS administrative practices;
- Requiring the IRS to address the NTA’s comments in final rules and including the NTA in deliberations prior to the release of a proposed rule
- Authorizing the NTA to file amicus briefs independently.


### Administrative Burden

In 2021, Americans filed 261 million tax returns and an astounding 4.7 billion information returns (such as Form W-2s, Form 1098s
and Form 1099s).46 Complying with tax law costs Americans more than $400 billion annually, or about 2 percent of gross domestic product.47 Although the IRS administers these reporting programs, most of this expense is mandated by Congress, not the IRS.

One of the primary reasons that Congress mandates ever-increasing information reporting is that the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation staff almost always overestimate how much revenue will be gained from
still more burdensome information reporting, and they do not estimate or report
private compliance costs. Congress and the Treasury Department must undertake
a serious review of the information reporting regime and reduce the burden on the
public—especially small businesses. Small businesses suffer disproportionately
from complexity and administrative burdens. Costs do not increase linearly with
size, so elevated administrative costs have an adverse effect on the competitiveness
of small firms.

Budget. The operating budget of the IRS should be held constant in real terms.
The resources allocated to the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate should be increased
by at least 20 percent (about $44 million). The Office of Equity, Diversity, and
Inclusion should be closed. Provided that IT management is changed; an effective,
well-considered implementation plan is adopted; and serious oversight is put in
place, additional resources dedicated solely to IT modernization may be warranted.


### INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

The Treasury Department should withdraw from Senate consideration the
Protocol Amending the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
Matters.48 The protocol will lead to substantially more transnational identity theft,
crime, industrial espionage, financial fraud, and suppression of political oppo-
nents and religious or ethnic minorities by authoritarian and corrupt governments,
including China, Colombia, Nigeria, and Russia. Unlike the original multilateral
convention, the amended convention is open to all governments—including many
that are either hostile to the United States, have serious corruption problems, or
have inadequate privacy protections. The new Administration should also oppose
the multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of
Financial Account Information.49

International organizations such as the OECD, the World Bank, and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund espouse economic theories and policies that are inimical
to American free market and limited government principles. The global elites who
operate the IMF regularly advance higher taxes and big centralized government.
The IMF has intervened in American policy debates—and has even recommended
that the U.S. raise taxes. The IMF’s record of advancing global financial stability
has been mixed at best. Its development assistance and lending programs in third-
world countries have more often than not retarded growth rather than advancing it.
The Treasury Department plays an important role in these international
institutions and should force reforms and new policies. The U.S., however, should
withdraw from both the World Bank and the IMF and terminate its financial con-
tribution to both institutions.

If the U.S. is to provide economic assistance or humanitarian aid to other nations,
it should do so unilaterally—not through the pass-throughs of international aid orga-
nizations, non-governmental organizations, or other nations. These organizations
and countries simply create expensive middle-men, while U.S. funds are intercepted
before being distributed to those in need. Also, these foreign entities have interests
that do not coincide with American national security and economic interests.


### Fiscal Responsibility

Treasury should make balancing the federal budget a mission-critical objective.
The federal budget absorbs enormous resources from the economy, both in money
taken from taxpayers and in money borrowed. The budget should be balanced by
driving down federal spending while maintaining a strong national defense and
not raising taxes.

To reduce interest payments on the debt, Treasury should lock in current rel- atively low interest rates by issuing longer duration bonds, and even consider creating a 50-year treasury bill. Most of the federal debt rolls over on average about every three to four years. But interest rates, even with the latest Federal Reserve rate increases, are still below the 5 percent historical average. Treasury would thus save taxpayers money during the next several decades by issuing fewer short-term notes that will probably have to be rolled over at higher rates in the future.

To promote transparency of finances, each year Americans should receive a
financial statement of the U.S. government alerting citizens of the revenues, expen-
ditures, deficit, and debt for the preceding fiscal year. The statement should also
include this individual family’s pro-rata share of the debt based on family size.


### International Competitiveness

The Treasury must act more assertively in international financial institutions to
protect and advance U.S. national interests—and oppose those that do not. It should
employ a carrot-and-stick approach by increasing its activity and commitment to
those financial institutions that are willing and able to adjust to this new approach
and by zeroing out or potentially exiting those institutions that rely on U.S. capital
while advancing agendas that run counter to U.S. interests.

A major emphasis of effecting this change must be the addition of a large
new cadre of U.S. professionals and contractors at these international
financial institutions.

The U.S. must insist on the hiring and support of this human capital as a
condition to future funding.


The U.S. should also examine increasing or decreasing its ownership levels
in these institutions in order to achieve maximum leverage.
