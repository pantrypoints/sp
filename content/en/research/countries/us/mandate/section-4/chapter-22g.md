U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Congress should examine whether to return the Treasury’s former in-house law enforcement capabilities via the return of the United States Coast Guard and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. 

Bringing these agencies back from the Department of Homeland Security and the Depart-
ment of Justice, respectively, would allow Treasury, in the case of U.S. Coast Guard,
to increase border security via a vigilance with respect to economic crimes (for
example, drug smuggling and tax evasion).

U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Congress should eliminate the U.S.
Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The USTDA is intended to help com-
panies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority
development projects in emerging economies. The USTDA links U.S. businesses
to export opportunities by funding project planning activities, pilot projects, and
reverse-trade missions while creating sustainable infrastructure and economic
growth in partner countries.

These activities more properly belong to the private sector. The best way to
promote trade and development is to reduce tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.
Another way is to reduce the federal budget deficit, and thereby federal borrowing
from abroad, freeing more foreign dollars to be spent on U.S. exports instead of
federal treasury bonds.

Other Issues. Many Treasury Department issues cut across multiple parts of
Treasury or other governmental agencies. Several are discussed in this chapter,
but not all can be covered here in depth. Other issues of concern include China,
cybersecurity, digital assets, digital services taxes, international debt defaults, Iran,
Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds and private sector pensions, sanctions
policy, and treasury auction and debt issuance.
