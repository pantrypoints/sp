## Mission Statement

### Overview

Created almost 70 years ago, the SBA was launched under the Small Business Act with a mission to “aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns.”1 According to its current mission statement: The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) helps Americans start, grow, and build resilient businesses.

SBA was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the federal government to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns; preserve free competitive enterprise; and maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation.2

The SBA’s founding mission has evolved over time as programs have been
expanded or implemented, subject to the philosophical grounding of each Admin-
istration as well as assorted economic challenges and the occurrence of natural
disasters. Because of its distinct role in the federal government, the SBA became The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) supports U.S. entrepreneurship and small business growth by strengthening free enterprise through policy advo-
cacy and facilitating programs that help entrepreneurs to launch and grow their
businesses and compete effectively in the global marketplace.

the default agency for providing disaster loans to small businesses, homeowners,
renters, and organizations. As a result, hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars have
been funneled through the agency to businesses and individuals over the years.
Some SBA programs are effective; others are not. The largest program in SBA’s
history, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has been credited with saving
millions of jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.3 A conservative Administration
would rightly focus on saving small businesses during such a crisis. At the same
time, however, various SBA programs have generated waste, fraud, and misman-
agement of taxpayer dollars.

For example, and more recently, more than $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief was
distributed through the SBA.4 The SBA’s EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan)
Advance program in particular shows the dangers that can come with direct
government lending. EIDL Advance provided direct cash grants and loans to
small businesses. The SBA Office of Inspector General “identified $78.1 billion in
potentially fraudulent EIDL loans and grants paid to ineligible entities,”5 which
represented more than half of all funds spent through the program. Although PPP
worked through private lenders and as a result experienced relatively less fraud
than EIDL experienced, it is estimated “that at least 70,000 [PPP] loans were
potentially fraudulent.”6


## ORIGIN, HISTORY, AND CORE FUNCTIONS

In 1954, the agency began to execute such core functions as “making and
guaranteeing loans for small businesses,” “ensuring that small businesses earn
a ‘fair proportion’ of government contracts and sales of surplus property,” and
“provid[ing] business owners with management and business training.”7
In 1970, President Richard Nixon’s Executive Order 11518 enhanced the agen-
cy’s advocacy role by providing for the “increased representation of the interests
of small business concerns before departments and agencies of the United States
Government.”8 This advocacy role was strengthened with the adoption of the Small
Business Amendments of 1974,9 which established the Chief Counsel for Advocacy,
and was then reinforced and expanded in 1976 with the creation of the Office of
Advocacy, providing additional resources to ensure that small businesses had a
voice in the regulatory process.

In 1980, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)10 further strengthened the Office
of Advocacy’s role, providing accountability across federal agencies to ensure that
they considered the impact of their rulemakings on small businesses. The RFA
requires federal agencies “to consider the effects of their regulations on small
businesses and other small entities,”11 and the Office of Advocacy is charged with
ensuring that federal agencies abide by the law and is required to provide an annual
report to the President and the Senate and House Committees on Small Business.12
In addition, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) of 201613

established a new role for the Office of Advocacy: “to facilitate greater consider-
ation of small business economic issues during international trade negotiations.”14
This small office has been relatively effective over the years—and more produc-
tive during periods when a strong Chief Counsel for Advocacy has been installed
to utilize the Office of Advocacy’s authority aggressively to provide a check on
regulatory overreach. The office is one of the bright spots within the SBA that a
conservative Administration could supercharge to dismantle extreme regulatory
policies and advance limited-government reforms that promote economic freedom
and opportunity.
Currently, the SBA’s four core functions include:

Entrepreneurial development programs. SBA provides “free” or low-
cost training at more than 1,800 locations and through online platforms
and webinars.

Government contracting support programs. Through goals established
by the SBA for federal departments and agencies, the broader goal is to
ensure that small businesses win 23 percent of prime contracts.
Advocacy. This independent office within the SBA works to ensure
that federal agencies consider small businesses’ concerns and impact in
rulemakings. The office also conducts small-business research.



### BUDGETARY FLUCTUATION

SBA’s budget and programs have expanded significantly under some Admin-
istrations and have been scaled back under others. President Ronald Reagan cut
the SBA’s budget by more than 30 percent, and his annual budgets regularly pro-
posed to eliminate the agency altogether.15 Under President George W. Bush, SBA
Administrator Hector Barreto said that SBA’s goal was “to do more with less,”16
but this changed because of Hurricane Katrina and a surge in disaster funding.
In 2016, President Barack Obama considered streamlining and combining SBA
programs and other business-related agencies and programs under one entity at
the U.S. Department of Commerce, but opposition within the small-business lobby
in Washington scuttled the effort.17

In general, SBA budget fluctuations have been driven by several factors such as
efforts by Administrations either to cut or to greatly expand programs, the need to
boost disaster assistance because of economic or weather-related events, business

Access to capital. SBA maintains assorted financing and lending
programs for small businesses, from microlending to debt and equity
investment capital.

loan credit subsidy costs, and miscellaneous program “enhancements” to support
small businesses through economic challenges or circumstances. As noted by the
Congressional Research Service:

Overall, the SBA’s appropriations have ranged from a high of over $761.9 billion in FY2020 to a low of $571.8 million in FY2007. Much of this volatility is due to significant variation in supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance to address economic damages caused by major hurricanes and for SBA lending program enhancements to help small businesses access capital during and immediately following recessions. For example, in FY2020, the SBA received over $760.9 billion in supplemental appropriations to assist small businesses adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic.18

The CRS further notes that “[o]verall, since FY2000, appropriations for SBA’s
other programs, excluding supplemental appropriations, have increased at a pace
that exceeds inflation.”19

In terms of current loan volume, the SBA “reached nearly $43 billion in fund- ing to small businesses, providing more than 62,000 traditional loans through its 7(a), 504, and Microloan lending partners and over 1,200 investments through SBA licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.”20 The agency’s total budgetary resources for FY 2022 amount to $44.25 billion, which represents 0.4 percent of the FY 2022 U.S. federal budget.21
