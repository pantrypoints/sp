For decades the world has struggled with a shifting maze of punitive tariffs, export subsidies, quotas, dollar-locked currencies, and the like. Many of these import-inhibiting and export-encouraging devices have long been employed by major exporting countries trying to amass ever larger [trade] surpluses.

Warren Buffett, CEO, Berkshire Hathaway1

The Chinese government is implementing a comprehensive, long-term
industrial strategy to ensure its global dominance.... Beijing’s ultimate goal
is for domestic companies to replace foreign companies as designers and
manufacturers of key technology and products first at home, then abroad.
U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission2

The United States of America is the world’s dominant superpower and remains
the world’s arsenal of democracy. To maintain that global positioning—and thereby
best protect the homeland and our own democratic institutions—it is critical that
the United States strengthen its manufacturing and defense industrial base at the
same time that it increases the reliability and resilience of its globally dispersed
supply chains. That will necessarily require the onshoring of a significant portion
of production currently offshored by American multinational corporations.

Trade policy can and must play an essential role in an American manufacturing
and defense industrial base renaissance. However, several major challenges in the
international trading environment are pushing America in the opposite direction.
The first challenge is rooted in MFN: the “most favored nation” rule of the World
Trade Organization (WTO). According to the MFN rule, WTO members must apply
the lowest tariffs that they apply to the products of any one country to the products
of every other country.3 However, WTO members can charge higher tariffs if they
apply these nonreciprocal tariffs to all countries.


The practical result has been the systematic exploitation of American farmers,
ranchers, manufacturers, and workers through higher tariffs institutionalized by
MFN. In turn, this unfair and nonreciprocal trade has resulted in chronic U.S. trade
deficits with much of the rest of the world. This systemic trade imbalance serves as
a brake and bridle on both GDP growth and real wages in the American economy
while encumbering the U.S. with significant foreign debt.

The second challenge is part of the broader existential threat posed by the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in its quest for global dominance. That chal-
lenge is rooted in the CCP’s continued economic aggression, which begins with
mercantilist and protectionist trade policy tools such as tariffs, nontariff barriers,
dumping, counterfeiting and piracy, and currency manipulation. However, Com-
munist China’s economic aggression also extends to an intricate set of industrial
policies and technology transfer–forcing policies that have dramatically skewed
the international trading arena.

Both the unfair, unbalanced, and nonreciprocal trade institutionalized by the
WTO and Communist China’s economic aggression are weakening America’s man-
ufacturing and defense industrial base even as the fragility of globally dispersed
supply chains has been brought into sharp relief by the COVID-19 pandemic with
its associated lockdowns and other disruptions and by the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Russian revanchism, in particular, has demonstrated once again how bad
actors on the world stage can use trade policy (for example, export restraints on
natural gas) as a weapon of war.


## LAYING THE TRADE DEFICIT PREDICATE

The great football coach Bill Parcells once said, “You are what your record says
you are.” America’s record on trade—specifically American’s chronic and ever-ex-
panding trade deficit—says that America is the globe’s biggest trade loser and a
victim of unfair, unbalanced, and nonreciprocal trade.
During the first year of the Biden Administration, the overall U.S. trade defi-
cit, including goods and services, soared by 29 percent, from $654 billion in 2020
to $845 billion in 2021.4 Over the same time period, imports of consumer goods,

capital goods, and the category of foods, feeds, and beverages were the highest on
record, and imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since 2014.
As for the U.S. trade deficit in goods, which primarily measures manufacturing
output, Table 1 catalogues that deficit for the top 13 countries plus the European
Union (EU) in fiscal year (FY) 2022. Note that the trade deficit in goods with Com-
munist China is by far the largest: It accounts for fully one-third of that deficit and
is more than twice the size of the deficit with the EU.

These trade deficit statistics implicitly measure the large amounts of Ameri-
ca’s manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains that have been
offshored to foreign lands. Such offshoring not only suppresses the real wages of
American blue-collar workers and denies millions of Americans the opportunity
to climb up the rungs of the ladder to the middle class, but also raises the specter of
a manufacturing and defense industrial base that, unlike our experience in World
Wars I and II, will not be able to provide the weapons and matériel that would be
needed should America enter another major world war or seek to assist a major ally
like Europe, Japan, or Taiwan. It is wise to recall Stalin’s admonition that “quantity

has a quality of its own.” In World War II in particular, it was not just the brave
soldiers, sailors, and pilots who beat the Nazis and Imperial Japan. It was America’s
factories—its “arsenal of democracy”—that overwhelmed the Axis forces.
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost certainly spawned in a CCP
biological weapons lab in Wuhan, China,5 global supply chains have been under
significant pressures from lockdown policies, energy price shocks, and other dis-
ruptions, including labor market disruptions. At the height of the pandemic, the
rising geopolitical risk associated with globalized supply chains was underscored
when Communist China, which controls much of the world’s pharmaceutical pro-
duction and supply chains, threatened to plunge America “into a mighty sea of
coronavirus” through pharmaceutical export controls6 if American politicians
dared to investigate what happened at the Wuhan lab.

Add all this up, and America’s trade situation and massive trade imbalances
pose not only a severe economic security threat, but also a national security threat.
As President Donald Trump indicated in announcing his 2017 National Security
Strategy, “economic security is national security.”7


CHALLENGE #1: UNFAIR AND NONRECIPROCAL TRADE INSTITUTIONALIZED IN WTO RULES

Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade
Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,
we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that
they sell to us.

President Donald J. Trump, 2019 State of the Union Address8
The World Trade Organization, with its 164 members, governs international
trade rules. Under its most favored nation (MFN) rule, each WTO member must
apply the lowest tariffs it applies to the products of any one country to the products
of every other WTO country. Importantly, nothing in the MFN rule requires a WTO
member to provide equal—that is, reciprocal or mirror—tariff rates to its trading
partners. Rather, under MFN, WTO members can charge systematically higher
tariffs to other countries to the extent negotiated in their WTO tariff schedules
so long as they apply those same higher tariffs to all countries.

As a poster child for the kind of nonreciprocal tariffs that American manufactur-
ers often face, the MFN tariff for automobiles applied by the U.S. is only 2.5 percent.
In contrast, the EU charges 10 percent, Communist China 15 percent, and Brazil 35
percent. Similarly, while the U.S. applies an MFN tariff rate of 6.2 percent on the
rice it buys from Malaysia, Malaysia applies an ad-valorem equivalent tariff of 40
percent on rice from the U.S. Meanwhile, European milk producers are shielded

by 67 percent tariffs while American milk producers benefit only from a 15 percent
tariff on foreign imports.9

From the perspective of strategic game theory, the WTO’s MFN rule provides
little or no incentive for higher-tariff countries to lower their tariffs. Rather, under
these conditions, the dominant strategy of any relatively high-tariff country is
simply to maintain those high tariffs while free riding off the lower-tariff countries.
The U.S. is disproportionately harmed by the WTO’s nonreciprocal tariff regime.
The countries that are hurt most by the WTO’s nonreciprocal tariff regime are
those like the United States that charge the lowest tariffs on average. This point is
illustrated in Table 2, which reports information on nonreciprocal tariffs that are
applied under the MFN rule on product lines at the six-digit level of the Harmo-
nized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS6).10

Table 2 presents results for a broad sample of 132 countries that account for
more than 60 percent of total U.S. trade and 98 percent of U.S. trade that is not cov-
ered by free trade agreements (FTAs). Within this broad sample of 132 countries,
U.S. exporters face higher tariffs in 467,015 different cases compared to 141,736
cases in which the U.S. charges higher nonreciprocal rates. In other words, U.S.
exporters face higher tariffs more than three times as often as the U.S. applies
higher tariffs.

Moreover, when American exporters face higher tariffs, the nonreciprocal tar-
iffs are typically much higher. As row 4 of Table 2 indicates, in the 467,015 cases in
which foreign partners charge higher tariffs, the average rate applied by the foreign
partners is 12.3 percentage points above the rate applied by the U.S. In contrast,﻿

in the 141,736 cases in which the U.S. charges the higher tariff, the average U.S.
applied rate is only 8.7 percentage points higher than the average applied tariff of
the foreign partner.

Separately, Communist China levies higher tariffs on 10 products for every
one Chinese product that is subject to a U.S.-applied higher tariff.11 India’s ratio is
even higher at 13 to one. Further, both Communist China and India also feature
significant nontariff barriers. Collectively, these higher nonreciprocal tariffs in
Communist China and India block American exporters from selling goods at com-
petitive prices to more than one-third of the world’s population.

Trade Deficit Impacts of the U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act. Under current
United States laws and regulations, an American President has limited ability
to fight back against the higher MFN tariffs now being levied against American
workers, farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers. Accordingly, behind the WTO’s
protective MFN shield, America’s free-riding trading partners have little or no
incentive to come to the bargaining table to negotiate lower tariffs.

To address this nonreciprocity stalemate, President Trump urged Congress in
his 2019 State of the Union address to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act
(USRTA).12 Under the USRTA, the President would have the authority to bring any
American trading partner that is currently applying higher nonreciprocal tariffs to
the negotiating table. If that trading partner refused to lower tariffs to U.S. levels,
the President then would have the authority to raise U.S. tariffs to match or “mirror”
the foreign partner’s tariffs.

The USRTA was introduced on January 24, 2019, by then-Representative Sean
Duffy (R–WI). The following month, a Harvard–Harris poll of 1,792 registered
voters found that 80 percent of respondents supported the USRTA.13 As Repre-
sentative Duffy noted at the time, the purpose of granting the President these
authorities was not to raise tariffs. Rather, it was to give the President, working in
close consultation with Congress, a sophisticated and targeted tool that he could
use to force other countries to lower their tariffs and nontariff barriers.14
Following the introduction of the USRTA, the White House Office of Trade and
Manufacturing Policy (which the author directed) ran simulations to estimate the
impact that implementation of the USRTA might have on the overall U.S. trade
deficit in goods and the large bilateral trade deficits the U.S. runs with many of its
major trading partners. The sample consisted of the same 132 trading partners used
in Table 2 above.15 The results underscore the unfair and unbalanced nonreciprocal
trade the U.S. is forced to accept under WTO MFN rules.

Two Scenarios. Scenario One in Table 3 assumes that our trading partners
lower their applied tariff rates on specific products to U.S. levels in cases where
their applied tariffs are higher. Scenario Two assumes that our trading partners
refuse to lower their tariff rates to match those of the U.S. Instead, in order to
uphold the principle of reciprocity, the U.S. raises its tariffs to mirror levels. To

calculate the trade deficit reductions under Scenario One and Scenario Two, the
analysis relied on the World Bank’s SMART tariff simulator. Table 3 provides the
simulation results.

In Scenario One, if all 132 countries were to lower their higher nonreciprocal
tariffs to U.S. levels, the overall U.S. trade deficit in goods would be reduced by
$58.3 billion, or about 9.4 percent of that deficit. In contrast, in Scenario Two, if
these countries were to refuse to reciprocate and the U.S. were to raise its tariffs
to mirror those countries’ levels, the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit would
be slightly larger: an estimated $63.6 billion, or 10.2 percent of the deficit. This
suggests that implementing the USRTA would help to create between 350,000
and 380,000 jobs.

The slightly larger reduction in the trade deficit in Scenario Two as a result
of the U.S. raising its tariffs to mirror those of its partners, as opposed to foreign
countries lowering their tariffs to U.S. levels, may seem surprising to those who are
steeped in Ricardian dogma and the textbook lessons of free trade. However, this
result speaks to the fact that so many of America’s trading partners are applying
significantly higher tariffs to thousands of American products.
Estimated Impacts on Key U.S. Bilateral Trade Deficits. If the USRTA were
enacted, a President would likely have to prioritize which countries he should
negotiate with first. One way to create such a priority list would be to choose those
countries that have relatively large trade deficits with the U.S. and apply relatively
high tariffs. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which maps bilateral trade deficits

47.6 percent of total U.S. trade and 88.6 percent of the U.S. trade deficit in goods.
Figure 1 shows that the USRTA priority list would include the countries in
red—Communist China and India—along with trading partners in the yellow zone.
This yellow zone includes the European Union, which features a very high deficit,
along with Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam, which feature particularly high tariff
differentials.

the American President, and then under Scenario Two, in which the U.S. matches
the tariffs of partners that refuse to lower their tariffs. Columns 2 and 4 in Table 4,
when the USRTA is applied first to Communist China and then to the EU, show the
largest absolute dollar reductions in bilateral trade deficits. This results in bilat-
eral deficit reductions in Scenario One of $18.5 billion for China and $8.0 billion
for the EU. In Scenario Two, the impacts for Communist China and the EU are
substantially larger: $70.6 billion and $25.3 billion, respectively.
Note further that the largest relative dollar reductions in percent terms come
from applying the USRTA first to India and then to Taiwan and Vietnam. For exam-
ple, if India were to reduce its tariffs to U.S. levels, as in Scenario One, this would
reduce the bilateral trade deficit with India by 24 percent. If the U.S. raised its
tariffs to mirror India’s levels, the result would be a far more dramatic 88 percent

reduction in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with India. Similarly, if Taiwan were to
reduce its tariffs to U.S. levels, the size of the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with Taiwan
would fall by 6 percent. If the U.S. imposed a mirror tariff, its bilateral trade deficit
with Taiwan would fall by 59 percent.
These results again underscore the high degree of unfair, unbalanced, and
nonreciprocal trade that currently exists between the U.S. and much of the rest
of the world, which penalizes American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and
workers because of the WTO-MFN conundrum. These simulations also demon-
strate that implementation of the USRTA most likely would substantially reduce
the U.S. trade deficit while creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. These
benefits notwithstanding, however, the U.S. would still face a substantial over-
all trade deficit and substantial bilateral trade deficits with many of its major
trading partners.

Why might this be so? Because under WTO rules, America still faces numerous
nonreciprocal nontariff barriers around the world. For example, one of America’s
largest trading partners, Japan, runs a significant bilateral trade surplus in goods
with the U.S.—more than $70 billion a year. While Japan has relatively low tariffs,
it ranks high on the nontariff barrier scale. In such cases, which are numerous, pas-
sage of the USRTA would likely also be very helpful in reducing nontariff barriers.
This is because under the powers provided by the USRTA, if a foreign country
imposes significantly higher nontariff barriers, then the President has the authority
to “negotiate and seek to enter into an agreement” that “commits the country to...
eliminate [its] nontariff barriers.”16 If the country refuses to come to the negoti-
ating table and lower its nontariff barriers, the President has the authority to levy
reciprocal duties to offset or mirror those barriers.

In summary, passage of the USRTA would go a long way toward leveling the
playing field for American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers who are
now forced to compete in an intrinsically unfair, unbalanced, and nonreciprocal
WTO-MFN system.

Nor is the USRTA necessarily the only possible legislative way to address this
issue. In 2017, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R–WI) and then-House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R–TX) proposed a “border adjust-
ment tax.” The proposed border adjustment would have eliminated the ability of
corporations to deduct the cost of imports while eliminating the tax on income
attributable to exports. This border adjustment tax would have shifted the U.S.
corporate income tax from an origin-based tax applying to the production of goods
and services in the United States to a destination-based tax applying to the con-
sumption of goods and services in the U.S.
This tax—strongly opposed by American multinational corporations and big-
box retailers—not only would have leveled the playing field with respect to WTO
rules, but also would have provided an innovative alternative to the application of tariffs.17 A conservative Administration might do well to look at such a tax as part
of its trade agenda.
