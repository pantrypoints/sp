## Mission/Overview

America’s antitrust laws are over a century old. 

In 1890, the U.S. Congress enacted the Sherman Act, the first federal prohibition on trusts and restraints of trade.

The Clayton Act, adopted in 1914, builds on the Sherman Act. It outlaws price fixing while regulating mergers and acquisitions.

The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) was also adopted in 1914. It gives the federal government legal tools to combat anticompetitive, unfair, and deceptive practices.

It empowers the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. 

The FTCA prohibits “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 

Sections 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act empower the FTC to block:
- unlawful tying contracts
- unlawful corporate mergers and acquisitions
- interlocking directorates. 

Under an amendment to the FTCA, the Robinson–Patman Act,4 the FTC has authority to prohibit practices involving discriminatory pricing and product promotion. 

While the FTC has enforcement or administrative responsibilities under more than 70 laws, the FTCA and the Clayton Act are the focus of its regulatory energy.

FTC actions, therefore, turn on the antitrust principles and market principles it adopts.

Modern approaches to antitrust stress that the objective of antitrust law is to assure a competitive economy—which in economic terms maximizes both allocative efficiency (optimal distribution of goods and services, taking into account consumer’s preferences, so that prices tend toward marginal cost) and productive efficiency (using the least amount of resources for optimal output)—and thereby
maximizes consumer welfare.5

Recently, however, many in the conservative movement have taken a broader view of antitrust. They point out that the authors of our antitrust laws did not intend this purely economic understanding of competitive markets—and the normative assumptions that undergird it—to guide their legislation. First, these principles were only imperfectly worked out at the time the antitrust laws were passed. Second, contemporaneous statements concerning the Sherman and Clay- ton Acts demonstrate Congress’s concern about the political and economic power of the oil and railroad trusts of the first Gilded Age, and their influence on dem- ocratic institutions and civil society. Antitrust law can combat dominant firms’ baleful effects on democratic institutions such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas, shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive behavior with government.

Republican Senator John Sherman explained to Congress in support of his
eponymous legislation:

If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a
king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries
of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an
autocrat of trade, with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of
any commodity.6

Similarly, identifying the institutional threats that market concentration can pose, the former Republican President and future Supreme Court Justice William Howard Taft wrote at the time, The federal antitrust law is one of the most important statutes ever passed in this country. It was a step taken by Congress to meet what the public had found to be a growing and intolerable evil in combinations between many who had capital employed in a branch of trade, industry, or transportation, to obtain control of it, regulate prices, and make unlimited profit. Taft saw in this economic threat broader implications for American society since “the building of great and powerful corporations which had, many of them, intervened in politics and through use of corrupt machines and bosses threatened us with a plutocracy.”7

Others in the conservative movement have maintained for numerous decades
that an economic justification is the only coherent approach to the antitrust laws.
Many view the first 90 years of U.S. antitrust policy as unprincipled in its approach,
often resulting in policies that, by trying to protect smaller competitors, ended up


[T]here is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its
resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long
as it stays in the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free
competition, without deception or fraud.10

For Friedman, market mechanisms, not political mechanisms, are the appropri-
ate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses. Business
managers appropriate shareholder wealth when they use corporate resources to
further their personal political beliefs, even when pursuing what they consider
a “socially responsible” or “moral” agenda. The business of American business is
business, not ideology.

More broadly, there is less and less debate around the growth of monopoly rents
throughout the U.S. economy. The current data strongly suggest that U.S. corpo-
rations are systematically earning far higher profits than they were 25 or 30 years
ago. Combined with other evidence that large corporations are accounting for an
increasing share of revenue and employment, it certainly appears that many large
U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing
so for at least 15 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession that
began in 2008.


raising prices for consumers. Judge Robert Bork in his influential book The Anti-
trust Paradox found economic justifications for previously denounced behavior
including small horizontal mergers, all vertical and conglomerate mergers, vertical
price maintenance and market division agreements, tying arrangements, exclusive
dealings and requirements contracts, “predatory” price cutting, and price “discrim-
ination.” Bork also defended corporate “bigness” if it came about through internal
growth or acceptable mergers. He also defended agreements between competitors
on prices, territories, refusals to deal, and other “suppressions of rivalry” that are
“ancillary” to some economic efficiency. The practical contribution of his work was
to put consumer welfare at the heart of competition law.8

Beyond antitrust injury, we are witnessing in today’s markets the use of eco-
nomic power—often market and perhaps even monopoly power—to undermine
democratic institutions and civil society. Practices such as Environmental, Social,
and Governance (ESG) requirements on publicly traded corporations and their
inclusion in business agreements, the so-called “de-banking” of industries and
individuals, and the interference of large internet firms with democratic political
discourse undermine liberal democracy, a truly open society, and, indeed, rule of
law. Without rule of law, markets themselves will wither.9

Critical of the “social responsibility” agenda, Milton Friedman in his provoc-
atively titled essay “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its
Profits” states,

While the explanations for this shift are not clear, what is particularly disturbing
is the possibility that these rents are extracted at least in part through regulatory
capture—which can function as a bar to entrance for new competitors. In addition,
the sheer cost of compliance with regulation favors large firms, which can more
efficiently spread the cost of regulation over a larger revenue base and have the
resources to invest in sophisticated government relations. The FTC must consider,
therefore, the role of government itself in maintaining market concentration in
areas ranging from pharmaceuticals and healthcare to avionics, banking, and real
estate brokerage.

Beyond undermining small businesses and reducing their salubrious moral
effect on American civil society, concentration of economic power facilitates col-
lusion between government and private actors, undermining the rule of law. The
continued emergence of evidence documenting collusion—between the Big Tech
internet platforms and the Biden White House and administrative agencies—to
censor criticism, scientific fact, and uncomfortable political truths demonstrates
this unfortunate development.

But, there are some caveats. 

1. The FTC lacks the power to revisit developments in antitrust laws, which have brought an invaluable rigor to the antitrust law—matters such as analyzing vertical integration, for example. Nor should it.

2. The FTC’s recent rescinding of its 2015 Policy Statement was undoubtedly ill-considered.

The consumer welfare standard must guide FTC action, but, in appropriate situations and with strong evidence, this standard must be expanded to include more factors than just price. Further, a similar standard of proof used to establish that a practice challenged by the Commission causes harm to competition must also apply in demonstrating the efficiencies that justify the practices. President Harry Truman reportedly made the famous quip, “Give me a one-handed economist.

All my economists say ‘on the one hand...’, then ‘but on the other.’” When it comes to some of the more vexing issues in antitrust regulation, the conservative movement is in the same predicament. Many wish to preserve the productivity and efficiency focus of an economic-based consumer welfare standard approach to antitrust enforcements; others are more willing to look at the effects of business concentration in certain industries on innovation, the institutional resilience of our democracy, and children’s development. The following discussion sets forth policy principles and initiatives on which there was agreement among the contributors to this chapter, and notes and explains where there was dissent.
