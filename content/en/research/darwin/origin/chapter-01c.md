Our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks.

Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to wild ones. 

I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made.

There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that 


Very many of the most strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in the wild.

In many cases, we do not know what the aboriginal stock was. And so could not tell whether the animal or plant reverted.

In order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home.

Our domesticated varieties occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms.

<!-- If we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of  -->

If we grew cabbage in very poor soil for many generations, they would partly or wholly revert to the wild aboriginal stock.

 <!-- (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, .  -->

Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. 

Reverting to the wild state is when species lose their acquired characters a while in unchanged domestic  conditions in a large scale and freely breeding with each other. 

If our domestic varieties reverted while domesticated then domestication means nothing to the species. 

<!-- , and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations of structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species.  -->

But there is no evidence in favour of this.

 <!-- to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.  -->

When the conditions of life do change in the wild, variations and reversions of character occur.

But natural selection will determine how far the new characters are preserved.

<!-- When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally perceive in each domestic race, less uniformity of character than in true species.

Domestic races of the same species:
- have more variety
0 , also, often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other, and from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied.

With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as, only in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of the same genus in a state of nature. -->

Most domestic races are judged as:
- mere varieties and
- the descendants of aboriginally distinct wild species.

Sometimes there is a marked distinction between domestic races and wild species.

<!-- , this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. It has often been stated that  -->

Domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. 

I think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct; 

But naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value; 

All such valuations being at present empirical.

<!-- Moreover, on the view of the origin of genera which I shall presently give, we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions. -->

We doubt the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species because we do not know whether they have descended from one or several parent-species.

<!-- This point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that 

, which we all know propagate their kind so truly, , then such facts would have great weight in making us -->

We can doubt the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural species if we could prove that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog were the offspring of any single species. 
- They would be simmilar to the foxes from different parts of the world.

I do not believe that all our dogs have descended from one wild species.

But, in the case of some other domestic races, there is strong evidence in favour of this view.


People have assumed that early humans have chosen for domestication the organisms that can vary and withstand diverse climates.

<!-- I do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions;  -->

But how could a savage know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and endure other climates? 

<!-- Has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer, or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication?  -->


<!-- If other organisms, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from the wild, and were bred for an equal number of generations under domestication, 

they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied. -->

I do not know whether most of our anciently domesticated orgnisms come from one or several species.

<!-- The argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on the monuments of Egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the breeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still existing. Even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case, what does it show, but that some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand years ago? But  -->

Mr. Horner's research have made it probable that civilized man existed in the Nile valley 14,000 years ago. They could have a semi-domestic dog in Egypt. 

<!-- ; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages, like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess , may not have existed in Egypt?

The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may, without here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other considerations, I think it highly probable that  -->

Our domestic dogs probably have descended from several wild species. But I do not know about sheep and goats. 

Mr. Blyth studied the habits, voice, and constitution, &c., of the humped Indian cattle. These had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle. Several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent. 

I think that:
- all horses descended from one wild stock. 
- all ducks and rabbits came from the common wild duck and rabbit.


Mr. Blyth thinks that all the breeds of poultry came from the common wild Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva).

The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. 

They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. 

At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain.

One author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain 11 wild species of sheep peculiar to it!

Britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal.

France has but few distinct from those of Germany and conversely, and so with Hungary, Spain, &c.

Each of these countries has several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, &c.

We must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in Europe.

 <!-- for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So it is in India. -->

The domestic dogs of the whole world probably descended from several wild species.

But there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. 

Who can believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &c.--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever existed freely in a state of nature? 

It has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; 

But by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; 

If we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, &c., in the wild state.

The possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. 

A race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels, which present any desired character.


I do not believe that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species.

Sir J. Sebright expressly experimentised for this and failed.

The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) extremely uniform.

But when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them will be alike.

Then the extreme difficulty and hopelessness of the task becomes apparent.

A breed intermediate between 2 very distinct breeds can only be arrived at through:
- extreme care
- long-continued selection

I cannot find a single case of a permanent race having been thus formed without those requirements.
