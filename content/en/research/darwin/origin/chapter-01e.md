How are domesticated races produced either from one or several allied species?

- Some little effect is from the direct action of the external conditions of life.
- Some are little to habit

But it would be bold to say that these are the causes of the differences between:
- a dray and race horse
- a greyhound and bloodhound
- a carrier and tumbler pigeon

Our domesticated races are adapted based on the design of man, not for the good of the animal or plant.

Some useful variations have probably arisen suddenly or gradually. 

Many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus.
<!-- , which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, ; and  -->
- This amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. 

So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. 

But the adaptations of following are good for humans in very different ways:
- the dray-horse versus the race-horse
- the dromedary and camel
- the various breeds of sheep for cultivated land or mountain pasture
  - the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose
- the many breeds of dogs


<!-- When we compare , with 'everlasting layers' which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant;
, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think,  -->

We must look beyond mere variability when we compare:
-  the game-cock with other less quarrelsome breeds
- the agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants


<!-- We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history. -->

The key to breeding is man's power of accumulative selection:
- Nature gives successive variations
- Humans add them up in certain directions useful to him.

<!-- In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds.

The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.  -->

Several of our eminent breeders have modified some breeds of cattle and sheep.

In order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals.

Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please.

<!-- If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. , who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal, -->

Youatt says that the principle of selection enables the agriculturist to modify the character of his flock. It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.' 

<!-- Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:- 'It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence.'

Sir John Sebright was the most skilful breeder. He used to say, with respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given feather in 3 years. But it would take him 6 years to obtain head and beak.' 

In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.

What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; 

These have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world.  -->

The improvement of species is not due to the crossing of different breeds. The best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely allied sub-breeds.

When a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. 

Selection is not merely the separating of some very distinct variety and breeding from it.

**It is the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction for successive generations of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye.**

<!-- --differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. -->

<!-- Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and  -->

A skilled breeder:
- studies his subject for years
- devotes his lifetime to it

 <!-- with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements.  -->

<!-- If he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.  -->

The same principles are followed by horticulturists but with more abrupt variations.

**Our choicest productions are not produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock.** 

<!-- We have proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. 

We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. --> 

When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants. Instead, they merely go over their seed-beds and pull up the 'rogues' that deviate from the proper standard.

<!-- With animals this kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to -->

Breeders do not allow the worst animals to breed.

The accumulated effects of selection is seen in plants by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden.

<!-- ; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. 

See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps never, the case. -->
