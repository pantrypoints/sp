The laws of correlation of growth will ensure some differences.

But, as a general rule, the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters.

<!-- It may be objected that  -->

The principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than 75 years. 

 <!-- it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject;  -->

<!-- The result has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that the principle  -->

Selection is not a modern discovery. I could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity.

<!-- In rude and barbarous periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the 'roguing' of plants by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. 

Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny.

The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans.  -->

These prove that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times.

 <!-- even if they do not show actual selection, , and is now attended to by the lowestsavages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious. -->

Currently, breeders try to use methodical selection to make a new superior strain or sub-breed.

Unconscious Selection results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals.
- This is more important. 

Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can. Afterwards, he breeds them from his own best dogs. But he has no wish of permanently altering the breed.

This process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed.

<!-- , in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. -->

<!-- Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago, which might serve for comparison. -->

In some cases, however, unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. 

King Charles's spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since his time.

The setter is directly derived from the spaniel.
- It has probably been slowly altered from it.

<!-- It is known that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the fox-hound;  -->

**But what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously, gradually, and yet so effectually.**

The old Spanish pointer came from Spain even if no native Spanish dog is like our pointer.

<!-- . But Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him -->

By a similar process of selection and careful training the English racehorses have surpassed the fleetness and size of the parent Arab stock.

<!-- so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights they carry. 

Lord Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country.  -->

<!-- By comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in Britain, India, and Persia, we can, I think, clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon. -->


Breeders have produced two distinct strains even if they never expected or wished it. 
- This is illustrated by Youatt

 <!-- gives an excellent  of the effects of a course of selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far that the  -->

 <!-- or even have wished to have produced the result which ensued--namely, the .  -->

Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess kept their own flocks of Leicester sheep purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for more than 50 years.


<!-- There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock. -->

Yet the resulting flocks is so great that they seem like different varieties.

<!-- If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable,and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. 

We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs. -->

In plants, the same gradual process of improvement is done through the occasional preservation of the best individuals.

 <!-- whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks.  -->

No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant.

<!-- No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock.  , appears, from Pliny's description,-->

The pear has been cultivated in classical times. But it has been a fruit of very inferior quality.

<!-- I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful  -->

Skilled gardeners have produced such splendid results from such poor materials.

But the art has been simple. The final result has been followed almost unconsciously. 

The process was to always cultivate the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and select a slightly better variety.

<!-- But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find. -->

Many changes in our cultivated plants were thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated.

This is why we cannot recognise the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated.

<!-- If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture.

It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.

In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons. 

And in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of 'natural selection,' as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed.

This, perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries. -->
