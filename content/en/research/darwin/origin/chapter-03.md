<!-- Before entering on the subject of this
chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on
Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst  -->

Organic beings in a state of nature has some individual variability.

<!-- ; indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or
varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are
entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted.  -->


My book is based on the existence of:
- individual variability 
- some few well-marked varieties

But these help us little in understanding how species arise in nature.

How have all those adaptations been perfected? 

<!-- of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being,   -->

How do varieties become distinct species?

<!-- Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become
ultimately converted into good and  -->

 which in most cases obviously differ from each
other far more than do the varieties of the same species? 

Genera are groups of species. How do their differences with other genera arise?

<!-- , which constitute what are called distinct , and which differ from each other more than do the
species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter,
follow inevitably from the struggle for life.  -->

These are caused by the struggle for life.

All variations are for self-preservation. These will generally be inherited by its offspring.

<!--  any variation, however
slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any
species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend
to the preservation of that individual, and will   -->

<!-- The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for,  -->

Of the many individuals of any species which are born, only a few can survive. 

I have called this principle as Natural Selection in order to relate it to artficial selection [used in breeding]. 

<!-- , by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of , in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.  -->

By selection, humans can adapt organic beings to his own uses through the accumulation of
slight but useful variations given to him by Nature.

But Natural Selection is:
- a power incessantly ready for action. 
- as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.


### The struggle for existence

The elder De Candolle and Lyell have shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition.

 <!-- , no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than  -->

W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester had great horticultural knowledge. He showed this for plants.

The universal struggle for life is:
- the easiest to admit
- the hardest to keep in mind*

{{< n n="This is because the idea is very negative, but the mind is postiive" >}}

<!-- in words the truth of , or more difficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. -->

 Yet unless it be thoroughly
engrained in the mind, I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on
distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.


We are happy to see the superabundance of food in Nature. But we forget that:
- the birds which sing around us are constantly destroying life by eating insects or seeds.
- their eggs are destroyed by beasts of prey
- food might be scarce in the next season even if they are now superabundant

This "Struggle for Existence" is metaphorical. It includes:
- the dependence of one being on another
- the individual's life
- the success in having offspring.

Two canine animals in a time of dearth, might struggle with each other on which shall get food.

But a plant in a desert struggles for life against the drought by being dependent on moisture. 

A plant might only have a few of its thousands of seeds reach maturity.
- It struggles with the other plants that already exist. 

<!-- The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees.

but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too
many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die.  -->

Several seedling missletoes that grow close together on the same branch struggle with each other.

The missletoe is spread by birds and so its existence depends on birds.
- It metaphorically struggles with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. 

<!-- In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence. -->

The high population growth rate of organic beings inevitably leads to a struggle for existence.

<!-- Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer
destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on
the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that
no country could support the product.  -->

Hence, the more population increases, the more the struggle for existence.*

{{< n n="This is only true if those beings are inherently negative and selfish" >}}

 <!-- as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a , either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. -->


This doctrine is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the animal and vegetable
kingdoms. This is because in the wild:
- food cannot be increased artificially 
- marriages cannot be restrained

<!-- for in this case there can be no  increase of food, and no prudential restraint
from .

Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. -->
