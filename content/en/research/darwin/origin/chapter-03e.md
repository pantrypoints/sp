<!-- A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks, namely, that  , in the most essential yet often hidden manner, -->

The structure of every organic being is related to that of all other organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys.

This is obvious in:
- the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and
- the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to tiger's hair. 

But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water.

Yet the advantage of plumed seeds stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground.

In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.

The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. 

But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.

Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. 

For the plant to increase in population, it should have some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it. 

On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant;

But only a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone.

Not until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease.

The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots. 

Hence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner.

If we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home, we should modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country.

For we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.

It is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed.

It will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be difficult to acquire. 

All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. 

When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.
