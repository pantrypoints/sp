Isolation is important in the production of new species. 

But the largeness of area is more important. It will give:
- a better chance of favourable variations from the many individuals of the same species there
- infinitely complex conditions of life from the many existing species

<!-- , more especially in the production of species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely.  -->

If some of these many species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. 

Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many others.

Hence more new places will be formed, andthe competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large than on a small and isolated area.

Moreover, great areas, though now continuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. 

Small isolated areas have been highly favourable for the production of new species.
- But the course of modification will generally be more rapid on large areas.

More importantly, the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely.
- This will give rise to most new varieties and species, and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world.

<!-- We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that  -->

The productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. 

Thus, also, it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands.

On a small island, the race for life will be less severe.
- There will have been less modification and less extermination.

Hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct tertiary flora of Europe.

All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated. 

It is in fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. 

These anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.

To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. 

For terrestrial productions, a large continental area is the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely.

<!-- , which will probably undergo many oscillations of level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition, will be  -->

This is because the inhabitants will have been subjected to very severe competition. 

When the land is broken up into islands, intercrossing will be checked.

 <!-- after physical changes of any kind, immigration will be prevented, so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. -->

When the islands are reunited, severe competition will resume.

The most improved varieties will spread.

The less improved forms will go extinct.

This will produce new species.

<!-- , and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus produce new species. -->

Natural selection always acts with extreme slowness, and only on a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. 


Its action depends on there being places which can be better occupied by inhabitants undergoing modification. 

The existence of such places will often depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked.

But the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; 

The mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed. 

Nothing can be effected, unless favourable variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process.

The process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing.

I do not believe that these causes can stop natural selection.

<!-- I further believe, that this very slow, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed.  -->

Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection.
