The geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species; and that varieties have at first often been local. All thesecauses taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.

He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of the same great formation. He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may overlook how important a part migration must have played, when the formations of any one great region alone, as that of Europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer this latter question only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the Silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean.

Passing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in palaeontology seem to me simply
to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection. We can thus
understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different
classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the
long run that all undergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the almost
inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can understand why when a species
has once disappeared it never reappears. 

Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure
for unequal periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends on
many complex contingencies. The dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave
many modified descendants, and thus new sub-groups and groups are formed. As these are formed,
the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor,
tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But
the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival
of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly
disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.
We can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which are those that oftenest
vary, will in the long run tend to people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these
will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the
struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the world will appear
to have changed simultaneously.

We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together one grand
system; for all are connected by generation. We can understand, from the continued tendency to
divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those
now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms,
sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly only
bringing them a little closer together.

The more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, itdisplays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between
existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and
very different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive
formations are more closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for the forms
are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an
intermediate formation are intermediate in character.

The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in
the race for life, and are, in so far, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague
yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has
progressed. 

If it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class, the fact will be intelligible. The succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance.

If then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be, and it may at least be asserted that
the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural
selection are greatly diminished or disappear.

On the other hand, all the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been produced by ordinary
generation: old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, produced by the
laws of variation still acting round us, and preserved by Natural Selection.
