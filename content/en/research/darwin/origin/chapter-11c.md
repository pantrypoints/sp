<!-- Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts.  -->



Migration is powerfully influenced by:

change of climate

 <!-- a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration, but now be impassable. -->

change in level in the land

A narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. 

Edward Forbes insisted that all the Atlantic islands were connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe with America. 

<!-- Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some mainland.  -->

<!-- If the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent.  -->

This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many difficulties.

But to the best of any judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. 

<!-- It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast changes in their position and extension, as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. -->

I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration. 

In the coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as I believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. 

Whenever it is fully admitted, as I believe it will some day be, that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands.

<!-- These and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious  -->


Forbes believes that there have been geographical revolutions within the recent period. But this is opposed by facts about distribution:
- the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent
- the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants
- a relation between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the sea


The nature and proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands oppose the belief that they were joined with continents in the past. 

Their volcanic composition favour the idea that they are the wrecks of sunken continents.

--if they had originally existed as
mountain-ranges on the land, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other
mountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or other such rocks, instead of
consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.

"Accidental means" can be more properly called occasional means of distribution.

I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the
injurious action of sea-water. 

To my surprise I found that out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated after an
immersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. For convenience sake I
chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they
could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the salt-
water. 

Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, &c., and some of these floated for a long
time. 

The buoyancy of green and seasoned timber are different.

Floods might wash down plants or branches.

These might be dried on the banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. 

Hence I dried stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea water. 

The majority sank quickly, but some which whilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer.

For instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated for 90 days and
afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days,
when dried it floated for 85 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of
Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards
germinated.


Out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28 days, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. 

So that as 64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28
days; and as 18/94 plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing
experiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may infer anything from
these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of 14/100 plants of any country might be floated
by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power of germination.

In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem.
- Some currents run at 60 miles per diem.

On this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.

Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones in a much better manner.

He placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. 

He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water.

On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we
have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer.

The result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. 

Plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. 

Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than
the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other
means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.

But seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific, procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find on examination, that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind
them,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport: out of one
small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three
dicotyledonous plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can
show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately
devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and
vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of
the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly all
germinated.

Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean. We may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit will pass
uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two months, I picked up
in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and
some of them, which I tried, germinated. But the following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as I know by trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. A bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and
the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Mr. Brent informs me that a friend
of his had to give up flying carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks on the English
coast destroyed so many on their arrival. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an
interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made
in the Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat,
millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty-one
hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus
retained for two days and fourteen hours. Freshwater fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water
plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to
place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to
fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either rejected the
seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained their power
of germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I can show that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed 22 grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch.

Thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances; for many facts could be given showing
that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds. Reflect for a moment on the millions of quails
which annually cross the Mediterranean; and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet
would sometimes include a few minute seeds? But I shall presently have to recur to this subject.
As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and have even carried
brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, I can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have
transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by Lyell;
and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores,
from the large number of the species of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the plants of
other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson) from the
somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these
islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds, during the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C.
Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and
he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the
archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the
shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the
seeds of northern plants.

Considering that the several above means of transport, and that several other means, which without
doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year after year, for centuries and tens of
thousands of years, it would I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely
transported. These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is not strictly
correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It
should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances;
for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of
seawater; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however,
would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from
island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to
another. The floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great
degree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. The currents, from their course,
would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do bring seeds
from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed by so long an immersion in saltwater, they could not endure our climate. 

Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt
sticking to their feet, which is in itself a rare accident. 

Even in this case, how small would the
chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great
error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and
it would be very difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through occasional
means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island,
though standing more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. I
do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-
stocked than Britain, scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to becomenaturalised. But this, as it seems to me, is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed, which chanced to
arrive, would be sure to germinate and survive.
