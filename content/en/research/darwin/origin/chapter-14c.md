With the belief that each species first existed as a variety and that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, no line can be drawn between:
- species which were supposed to have been produced by creation
- varieties produced by secondary laws. 

<!-- On this same view we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties;  -->

If species were created, then the creation mechanism should still be in action.

<!-- ; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. -->

Moreover, the species of the large genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera.

The closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in little groups round other species--in which respects they resemble varieties. These are strange relations on the view of each species having been independently created, but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties.

As each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number.

The modified descendants of each species will can increase so much the more as they become more diversified in habits and structure.

<!-- so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a  -->


Natural selection will constantly tend to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. 

Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same genus.

New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. 

Dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms.

In this way, each large group tends to become larger and more divergent.

But not all groups can succeed in increasing in size because of the limited space. 

And so the more dominant groups beat the less dominant.

This tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, 

This explains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes.

We see this everywhere around us throughout history. 

This is unexplainable by the the theory of creation.

<!-- , and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on  -->

Natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, and favourable variations.

This is why it can only:
- produce no great or sudden modification
- act by very short and slow steps

Hence the canon of 'Natura non facit saltum,' which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. 

This is why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation.

But no one can explain why is this a law of nature if each species has been independently created.*

{{< n n="This is because that phenomena works on animals which only have low chakras developed, but not on humans that have more developed higher chakras" >}}


Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How strange it is that a bird, under the form of 

A woodpecker preys on insects on the ground

upland geese which never swim have webbed feet

a thrush dives and feeds on sub-aquatic insects

a petrel has the habits fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! 

But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or perhaps might even have been anticipated.

Natural selection acts by competition. It adapts the inhabitants of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates. 

This is why the inhabitants of a country can be beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. 

<!-- , although on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and adapted for that country, being -->

Nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect.

If some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. 

We need not marvel at:
- the sting of the bee causing the bee's own death
- drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters
- the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees
- the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters
- ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars

The wonder is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed.

The complex and little known laws governing variation are the same with the laws which govern the production of specific forms. 

In both cases, physical conditions have produced but little direct effect.

Yet when varieties enter any zone, they assume some of the characters of the species proper to that zone. 

In both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced some effect; for it is difficult to resist this conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark cavesof America and Europe. In both varieties and species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts are necessarily modified.

In both varieties and species reversions to long-lost characters occur. How inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon! On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should the specific characters, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic characters in which they all agree? 

Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species, supposed to have been created independently, have differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers? 

If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other.

Therefore these same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an enormous period.

The theory of creation cannot explain why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation.

 but, on my view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. 

 But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner.

 For example, the wing of a bat.

and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural selection.

Instincts offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. 

We can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. 

I have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. 

Habit sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts.

But it certainly is not indispensable in the case of neuter insects which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. 

On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions of life, yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British species. 

Some think that instincts are slowly acquired through natural selection.

Some instincts are liable to mistakes.

If species are only well-marked and permanent varieties, then their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their resemblance to their parents.

<!-- --in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such points,--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. On the other hand, these would be -->

<!-- It would be strange if:
- species have been independently created
- varieties have been produced by secondary laws

If we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree, then such facts as the record gives, support the theory of descent with modification. -->

New species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals.

The amount of change, after equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. 

The extinction of species follows on the principle of natural selection.

This is because old forms will be supplanted by new and improved forms. 

Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken. 

The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world.

The fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent. 

All extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings, falling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. 

The groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character.
- The progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in character compared with its later descendants.

This is why the more ancient the fossil, the oftener it is intermediate between existing and allied groups. 

Recent forms are higher than ancient and extinct forms.

They are in so far higher as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for life. 

The law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent are seen in:
- marsupials in Australia
- edentata in America 

Within a confined country, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent.

Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in Distribution. 

This is why there is so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space.

In their geological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of modification have been the same. 

We see the full meaning of the wonderful fact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that 

On the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related.
- This is because they are descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. 

<!-- under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes,  -->

On this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean. 

Although two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely separated from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations, and as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other, at various periods and in different proportions, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be different.

On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that many should be peculiar. We can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should not inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent. Such facts as the presence of peculiar species of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on oceanic islands, are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.

The existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species common to both still exist. 

Wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur. 

It is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. 

We see this in nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands being related in the most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and those of the Cape de Verde archipelago and other African islands to the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation. The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same principles we see how it is, that the mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous. 

We see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classification;--why adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service to the being, are often of high classificatory value; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent. The natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, however slight their vital importance may be.

The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,--the same number of vertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,--and innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications. 

The similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,--in the jaws and legs of a crab,--in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class.

On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. 

We may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiae.Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. 

But disuse and selection will act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age.

The calf has inherited teeth which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw.
- It comes from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth.

The teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid.

Whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day.

On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand.
