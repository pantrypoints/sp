Thus, when one wants to solve a problem, one must first consider it as already completed, and assign names to all the lines that seem necessary for its construction—both those that are unknown and the others.

Then, without making any distinction between these known and unknown lines, one must work through the difficulty in the order that most naturally shows how they all depend on each other, until a way is found to express the same quantity in 2 different ways.

This is called an equation, since the terms of one expression are equal to those of the other.

We must find as many such equations as there are unknown lines assumed. 

Or, if fewer are found, and yet nothing essential is omitted from the question, this indicates that the problem is not fully determined. In that case, one may arbitrarily assign known lines to any of the unknowns that do not correspond to an equation.

After that, if several unknowns still remain, one must use each of the remaining equations in turn—either considering each one individually or comparing them with others—in order to express each unknown line, and thereby reduce everything until only a single unknown remains, equal to some known quantity, or to something whose square, or cube, or square of a square, or higher power, or square of a cube, etc., is equal to the result of adding or subtracting two or more other quantities, one of which is known and the others are composed of certain mean proportionals between the unit and that square or cube or higher power, multiplied by other known quantities.

z = b

z is unknown but is equal to b

z..

the square of z is equal to the square of b minus a multiplied by z

z..

the cube of z is equal to a multiplied by the square of z plus the square of b multiplied by z minus the cube of c and so on.

One can always reduce all the unknown quantities to just one, when the problem can be constructed using circles and straight lines, or also using conic sections, or even some other curve that is only one or two degrees more complex. 

But I will not go into more detail about this, because I would deprive you of the pleasure of discovering it for yourself, and of the benefit of exercising your mind by practicing it—which, in my opinion, is the main value one can derive from this science.

Moreover, I do not see anything so difficult in it that those who are somewhat versed in ordinary geometry and in algebra, and who pay attention to everything in this treatise, could not discover for themselves.


That is why I will be content here to simply warn you that, provided one does not fail to make use of all possible divisions when working through these equations, one will infallibly arrive at the simplest terms to which the question can be reduced.

If the problem can be solved by ordinary geometry—that is, by using only straight lines and circles drawn on a flat surface—then, when the final equation has been fully simplified

 at most there will remain only an unknown square equal to the result of adding or subtracting its root, multiplied by some known quantity, and some other known quantity as well.

This root, or unknown line, is easily found. For example,

z2 = az + b2

If I make the right triangle NLM, where the side LM is equal to the square root of a known quantity, and the other side LN is half of another known quantity (which was multiplied by the unknown line that I suppose to be the one we are seeking), and then I extend MN, the base of this triangle, to point O so that NO is equal to NL, then OM is the line we are seeking. And it is expressed in this way: [...]

If I have [...], and [...] is the quantity to be found, I construct the same right triangle NLM, and from its base MN, I subtract NP, equal to NL, and the remaining PM is the sought root. So I have [...]. Likewise, if I had [...], then PM would be [...], and I would have [...], and so on.

Finally, if I have [...], I make NL equal to [...], and LM equal to [...] as before. Then, instead of joining points MN, I draw MQR parallel to LN. And from center N, I draw a circle through point L which intersects MQR at points Q and R. The sought line is then MQ or MR, because in this case it is expressed in two ways—namely, [...] and [...].

And if the circle, having its center at point N and passing through L, neither intersects nor touches the straight line MQR, then there is no root in the equation. In such a case, one can say that the construction of the proposed problem is impossible.



The same roots can be found by an infinite number of other means.

We can construct all the Problems of ordinary Geometry by using only the 4 shapes that I have explained. I do not think the ancients have noticed this. 

Otherwise, they would not have needed to write so many large books. 

The mere order of their propositions makes us realize that they did not have the true method to find them all.

Instead, they have only collected those they have encountered.

An example is from Pappus at the beginning of his book 7 where he enumerated all that had been written in Geometry by those who had preceded him.

He the asks a question, which he says that neither Euclid, nor Apollonius, nor anyone else had been able to fully solve. 

{{< q a="Pappus" >}}
"The place to 3 and 4 lines which Apollonius says in the third book was not completed by Euclid, nor could he complete it himself, nor anyone else: but not even to add a little to what Euclid wrote, by those conic [sections] which were demonstrated up to Euclid's time, etc."

"But the place to 3 and 4 lines, in which (Apollonius) boasts magnificently and shows off, without any thanks to him who had written before, is of this kind. 

If 3 straight lines given in position are drawn from one and the same point to the 3 lines at given angles, and the ratio of the rectangle contained by the two drawn [lines] to the square of the remaining [line] is given: the point touches a solid locus, that is one of the 3 conic sections.

If lines are drawn to 4 straight lines given in position at given angles; and the ratio of the rectangle contained by the two drawn [lines] to that contained by the remaining two is given: similarly the point will touch a given conic section in position. 
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Pappus" >}}
If the plane locus has been shown for two [lines] only. But if for more than four, the point will touch loci not yet known, but lines only mentioned; what kind they are, or what property they have, is not known: one of them, not the first, and which seems most manifest, they have composed showing it to be useful. But the propositions of these are as follows.

If from some point 5 straight lines are drawn to the straight lines given in position at given angles, and the ratio of the rectangular solid parallelepiped contained by the three drawn lines is given to the rectangular solid parallelepiped contained by the remaining two, and a given line is given, the point will touch the line given in position. 

But if to six, and the ratio of the solid contained by the three lines to the solid contained by the remaining three is given; again the point will touch the line given in position. But if to more than six, they do not yet have to say whether the ratio of any solid contained by 4 lines to that contained by the remaining [lines] is given, since there is nothing contained by more than 3 dimensions."
{{< /q >}}


The scruple which the ancients made of using the terms of Arithmetic in Geometry, which could only proceed from the fact that they did not see their relationship clearly enough, caused much obscurity and embarrassment in the way they explained themselves. 

Pappus continues:


{{< q a="Pappus" >}}
"They acquiesce in those who have interpreted such things a little earlier. Not signifying in any way one comprehensible thing that is contained in these. 

But it will be possible through combined proportions to both say and demonstrate these universally in the said proportions, and in this way. 

If from some point straight lines are drawn to the straight lines given in position at given angles, and the combined ratio is given of that which one of the drawn [lines] has to one, and another to another, and another to another, and the remainder to a given line, if there are seven; but if eight, and the remainder to the remainder: the point will touch the lines given in position. 

Similarly however many they may be, odd or even in number, since these, as I said, correspond to the place to four lines, they have therefore placed none so that the line is known, etc."
{{< /q >}}


The question which had been begun to be solved by Euclid, and pursued by Apollonius, without having been completed by anyone, was as follows. 

{{< q >}}
But which (Apollonius) says in the third book that the place at three and four lines was not perfected by Euclid, neither he himself nor anyone else could have perfected:

but not even the slightest addition to what Euclid wrote, by means of those conics which were shown in advance up to the time of Euclid, etc.
{{< /q >}}

He asks the question:

But at the third and fourth lines, in which (Apollonius) magnificently boasts and shows off, no credit being given to him who had written earlier, it is of this kind: If from one and the same point, straight lines are drawn at given angles to three straight lines given in position; and if the ratio of the rectangle contained by two of the drawn lines to the square of the remaining one is given: the point touches a solid locus given in position, that is, one of the three conic sections. And if lines are drawn at given angles to four straight lines given in position; and if the ratio of the rectangle contained by two of the drawn lines to the rectangle contained by the other two is given: similarly the point will touch a given conic section in position. If indeed [lines are drawn] to only two, the locus is shown to be a plane. But if [lines are drawn] to more than four, the point will touch loci not yet known, but only called lines; but what kind they are, or what property they have, is not certain: they have put together and shown one of them, and not the first, and the one that seems most obvious, showing it to be useful. But their propositions are these:

If from some point straight lines are drawn at given angles to five straight lines given in position, and if the ratio of the rectangular parallelepiped contained by three of the drawn lines to the rectangular parallelepiped contained by the other two and some given line is given, the point will touch a line given in position. But if [lines are drawn] to six, and if the ratio of the solid contained by three lines to the solid contained by the other three is given; again the point will touch a line given in position. But if [lines are drawn] to more than six, they do not yet have anything to say, whether a ratio of some content of four lines to that which is contained by the rest is given, since there is nothing contained by more than three dimensions




Having 3 or 4 or more straight lines given by position; first a point is asked, from which one can draw as many other straight lines, one on each of the given ones, which make given angles with them, and that the rectangle contained by two of those which will thus be drawn from the same point, have the given ratio with the square of the third, if there are only three; or with the rectangle of the other two, if there are four; 

or, if there are five, that the parallelepiped composed of three have the given ratio with the parallelepiped composed of the two that remain, and of another given line.


<!-- Au reste ces mesmes racines se peuuent trouuer par vne infinité d’autres moyens, et i’ay seulement voulu mettre ceux cy, comme fort simples, affin de faire voir qu’on peut construire tous les Problesmes de la Geometrie ordinaire, sans faire autre chose que le peu qui est compris dans les quatre figures que i’ay expliquées. Ce que ie ne croy pas que les anciens ayent remarqué. car autrement ils n’eussent pas pris la peine d’en escrire tant de gros liures, où le seul ordre de leurs propositions nous fait connoistre qu’ils n’ont point eu la vraye methode pour les trouuer toutes, mais qu’ils ont seulement ramassé celles qu’ils ont rencontrées.

Exemple tiré de Pappus. Et on le peut voir aussy fort clairement de ce que Pappus a mis au commencement de son septiesme liure, ou aprés s’estre aresté quelque tems à denombrer tout ce qui auoit esté escrit en Geometrie par ceux qui l’auoient precedé, il parle enfin d’vne question, qu’il dit que ny Euclide, ny Apollonius, ny aucun autre n’auoient sceu entierement resoudre. Et voycy ses mots.


Ie cite plutost la version latine que le texte grec affin que chascun l’entende plus aysement.Quem autem dicit (Apollonius) in tertio libro locum ad tres, et quatuor lineas ab Euclide perfectum non esse, neque ipse perficere poterat, neque aliquis alius : sed neque paululum quid addere iis, quae Euclides scripsit, per ea tantum conica, quae usque ad Euclidis tempora praemonstrata sunt, etc.

Et vn peu aprés il explique ainsi quelle est cete question.

At locus adtres, et quatuor lineas, in quo (Apollonius) magnifice se iactat, et ostentat, nulla habita gratia ei, qui prius scripserat, est hujusmodi. Si positione datis tribus rectis lineis ab uno et eodem puncto, ad tres lineas in datis angulis rectae lineae ducantur, et data sit proportio rectanguli contenti duabus ductis ad quadratum reliquae : punctum contingit positione datum solidum locum, hoc est unam ex tribus conicis sectionibus. Et si ad quatuor rectas lineas positione datas in datis angulis lineae ducantur ; et rectanguli duabus ductis contenti ad contentum duabus reliquis proportio data sit : similiter punctum datam coni sectionem positione continget. Si quidem igitur ad duas tantum locus planus ostensus est. Quod si ad plures quam quatuor, punctum continget locos non adhuc cognitos, sed lineas tantum dictas ; quales autem sint, vel quam habeant proprietatem, non constat : earum unam, neque primam, et quae manifestissima videtur, composuerunt ostendentes utilem esse. propositiones autem ipsarum hae sunt.

Si ab aliquo puncto ad positione datas rectas lineas quinque ducantur rectae lineae in datis angulis, et data sit proportio solidi parallelepipedi rectanguli, quod tribus ductis lineis continetur ad solidum parallelepipedum rectangulum, quod continetur reliquis duabus, et data quapiam linea, punctum positione datam lineam continget. Si autem ad sex, et data sit proportio solidi tribus lineis contenti ad solidum, quod tribus reliquis continetur ; rursus punctum continget positione datam lineam. Quod si ad plures quam sex, non adhuc habent dicere, an data sit proportio cuiuspiã contenti quatuor lineis ad id quod reliquis continetur, quoniam non est aliquid contentum pluribus quam tribus dimensionibus.

Ou ie vous prie de remarquer en passant, que le scrupule, que faisoient les anciens d’vser des termes de l’Arithmetique en la Geometrie, qui ne pouuoit proceder, que de ce qu’ils ne voyoient pas assés clairement leur rapport, causoit beaucoup d’obscurité, et d’embaras, en la façon dont ils s’expliquoient. car Pappus poursuit en cete sorte.

acquiescunt autem his, qui paulo ante talia interpretati sunt. neque unum aliquo pacto comprehensibile significantes quod his continetur. Licebit autẽ per coniunctas proportiones haec, et dicere, et demonstrare uniuerse in dictis proportionibus, atque his in hunc modum. Si ab aliquo puncto ad positione datas rectas lineas ducantur rectae lineae in datis angulis, et data sit proportio coniuncta ex ea, quam habet una ductarum ad unam, et altera ad alteram, et alia ad aliam, et reliqua ad datam lineam, si sint septem ; si vero octo, et reliqua ad reliquam : punctum continget positione datas lineas. Et similiter quotcumque sint impares vel pares multitudine, cum haec, ut dixi, loco ad quatuor lineas respondeant, nullum igitur posuerunt ita ut linea nota sit, etc.



La question donc qui auoit esté commencée à resoudre par Euclide, et poursuiuie par Apollonius, sans auoir esté acheuée par personne, estoit telle. Ayant trois ou quatre ou plus grand nombre de lignes droites données par position ; premierement on demande vn point, duquel on puisse tirer autant d’autres lignes droites, vne sur chascune des données, qui façent auec elles des angles donnés, et que le rectangle contenu en deux de celles, qui seront ainsi tirées d’vn mesme point, ait la proportion donnée auec le quarré de la troisiesme, s’il n’y en a que trois ; ou bien auec le rectangle des deux autres, s’il y en a quatre ; ou bien, s’il y en a cinq, que le parallelepipede composé de trois ait la proportion donnée auec le parallelepipede composé des deux qui restent, et d’vne autre ligne donnée.  -->



Ou s’il y en a six, que le parallelepipede cõposé de trois ait la proportion donnée auec le parallelepipede des trois autres. Ou s’il y en a sept, que ce qui se produist lorsqu’on en multiplie quatre l’vne par l’autre, ait la raison donnée auec ce qui se produist par la multiplication des trois autres, et encore d’vne autre ligne donnée ; Ou s’il y en a huit, que le produit de la multiplication de quatre ait la proportion donnée auec le produit des quatre autres. Et ainsi cete question se peut estendre à tout autre nombre de lignes. Puis à cause qu’il y a tousiours vne infinité de diuers poins qui peuuent satisfaire à ce qui est icy demandé, il est aussy requis de connoistre, et de tracer la ligne, dans laquelle ils doiuent tous se trouuer. Et Pappus dit que lorsqu’il n’y a que trois ou quatre lignes droites données, c’est en vne des trois sections coniques. mais il n’entreprend point de la determiner, ny de la descrire. non plus que d’expliquer celles ou tous ces poins se doiuent trouuer, lorsque la question est proposée en vn plus grand nombre de lignes. Seulement il aiouste que les anciens en auoient imaginé vne qu’ils monstroient y estre vtile, mais qui sembloit la plus manifeste, et qui n’estoit pas toutefois la premiere. Ce qui m’a donné occasion d’essayer si par la methode dont ie me sers on peut aller aussy loin qu’ils ont esté.

Response à la question de Pappus. Et premierement i’ay connu que cete question n’estant proposée qu’en trois, ou quatre, ou cinq lignes, on peut tousiours trouuer les poins cherchés par la Geometrie simple ; c’est à dire en ne se seruant que de la reigle et du compas, ny ne faisant autre chose, que ce qui a desia esté dit ; excepté seulement lorsqu’il y a cinq lignes données, si elles sont toutes paralleles. Auquel cas, comme aussy lorsque la question est proposée en six, ou 7, ou 8, ou 9 lignes, on peut tousiours trouuer les poins cherchés par la Geometrie des solides ; c’est à dire en y employant quelqu’vne des trois sections coniques. Excepté seulement lorsqu’il y a neuf lignes données, si elles sont toutes paralleles. Auquel cas derechef, et encore en 10, 11, 12, ou 13 lignes on peut trouuer les poins cherchés par le moyen d’vne ligne courbe qui soit d’vn degré plus composée que les sections coniques. Excepté en treize si elles sont toutes paralleles, auquel cas, et en quatorze, 15, 16, et 17 il y faudra employer vne ligne courbe encore d’vn degré plus composée que la precedente. et ainsi à l’infini.

Puis iay trouué aussy, que lorsqu’il n’y a que trois ou quatre lignes données, les poins cherchés se rencontrent tous, non seulement en l’vne des trois sections coniques, mais quelquefois aussy en la circonference d’vn cercle, ou en vne ligne droite. Et que lorsqu’il y en a cinq, ou six, ou sept, ou huit, tous ces poins se rencontrent en quelque vne des lignes, qui sont d’vn degré plus composées que les sections coniques, et il est impossible d’en imaginer aucune qui ne soit vtile à cete question ; mais ils peuuent aussy derechef se rencontrer en vne section conique, ou en vn cercle, ou en vne ligne droite. Et s’il y en a neuf, ou 10, ou 11, ou 12, ces poins se rencontrent en vne ligne, qui ne peut estre que d’vn degré plus composée que les precedentes ; mais toutes celles qui sont d’vn degré plus composées y peuuent seruir, et ainsi à l’infini.

Au reste la premiere, et la plus simple de toutes aprés les sections coniques, est celle qu’on peut descrire par l’intersection d’vne Parabole, et d’vne ligne droite, en la façon qui sera tantost expliquée. En sorte que ie pense auoir entierement satisfait à ce que Pappus nous dit auoir esté cherché en cecy par les anciens. Et ie tascheray d’en mettre la demonstration en peu de mots. car il m’ennuie desia d’en tant escrire.

Soient AB, AD, EF, GH, etc. plusieurs lignes donnees par position, et qu’il faille trouuer vn point, comme C, duquel ayant tiré d’autres lignes droites sur les données, comme CB, CD, CF, et CH, en sorte que les angles CBA, CDA, CFE, CHG, etc. soient donnés, et que ce qui est produit par la multiplication d’vne partie de ces lignes, soit esgal à ce qui est produit par la multiplication des autres, ou bien qu’ils ayent quelque autre proportion donnée, car cela ne rend point la question plus difficile.

Commẽt on doit poser les termes pour venir à l’Equation en cet exemple.Premierement ie suppose la chose comme desia faite, et pour me demesler de la cõfusion de toutes ces lignes, ie considere l’vne des données, et l’vne de celles qu’il faut trouuer, par exemple AB, et CB, comme les principales, et ausquelles ie tasche de rapporter ainsi toutes les autres. Que le segment de la ligne AB, qui est entre les poins A et B, soit nommé . Et que BC soit nommé . Et que toutes les autres lignes données soient prolongées, iusques à ce qu’elles couppent ces deux, aussy prolongées s’il est besoin, et si elles ne leur sont point paralleles. comme vous voyes icy qu’elles couppent la ligne AB aux poins A, E, G, et BC aux poins R, S, T. Puis à cause que tous les angles du triangle ARB sont donnés, la proportion, qui est entre les costés AB, et BR, est aussy donnée, et ie la pose comme de à , de façon que AB estant , RB sera , et la toute CR sera , à cause que le point B tombe entre C et R ; car si R tomboit entre C et B, CR seroit  ; et si C tomboit entre B et R, CR seroit . Tout de mesme les trois angles du triangle DRC sont donnés, et par consequent aussy la proportion qui est entre les costés CR, et CD, que ie pose comme de à  : de façon que CR estant , CD sera . Aprés cela pource que les lignes AB, AD, et EF sont données par position, la distance qui est entre les poins A et E est aussy donnée, et si on la nomme , on aura EB esgal à  ; mais ce seroit , si le point B tomboit entre E et A ; et , si E tomboit entre A et B. Et pource que les angles du triangle ESB sont tous donnés, la proportion de BE à BS est aussy donnée, et ie la pose comme à , si bien que BS est , et la toute CS est  ; mais ce seroit , si le point S tomboit entre B et C ; et ce seroit , si C tomboit entre B et S. De plus les trois angles du triangle FSC sont donnés, et en suite la proportion de CS à CF, qui soit comme de à , et la toute CF sera . En mesme façon AG que ie nomme est donnée, et BG est , et à cause du triangle BGT la proportion de BG à BT est aussy donnée, qui soit comme de à . et BT sera , et CT . Puis derechef la proportion de TC à CH est donnée, à cause du triangle TCH, et la posant comme de à , on aura CH .

Et ainsi vous voyés, qu’en tel nombre de lignes données par position qu’on puisse auoir, toutes les lignes tirées dessus du point C à angles donnés suiuant la teneur de la question, se peuuent tousiours exprimer chascune par trois termes ; dont l’vn est composé de la quantité inconnue , multipliée, ou diuisee par quelque autre connue ; et l’autre de la quantité inconnue , aussy multipliée ou diuisée par quelque autre connuë ; et le trosiesme d’vne quantité toute connuë. Excepté seulement si elles sont paralleles ; ou bien à la ligne AB, auquel cas le terme composé de la quantité sera nul ; ou bien à la ligne CB, auquel cas celuy qui est composé de la quantité sera nul ; ainsi qu’il est trop manifeste pour que ie m’areste à l’expliquer. Et pour les signes , et , qui se ioignent à ces termes, ils peuuent estre changés en toutes les façons imaginables.

Puis vous voyés aussy, que multipliant plusieurs de ces lignes l’vne par l’autre, les quantités et , qui se trouuent dans le produit, n’y peuuent auoir que chascune autant de dimensions, qu’il y a eu de lignes, à l’explication desquelles elles seruent, qui ont esté ainsi multipliées : en sorte qu’elles n’auront iamais plus de deux dimensions, en ce qui ne sera produit que par la multiplication de deux lignes ; ny plus de trois, en ce qui ne sera produit que par la multiplication de trois, et ainsi à l’infini.

Commẽt on trouue que ce problesme est plan, lorsqu’il n’est point proposé en plus de 5 lignes.De plus, à cause que pour determiner le point C, il n’y a qu’vne seule condition qui soit requise, à sçauoir que ce qui est produit par la multiplication d’vn certain nombre de ces lignes soit esgal, ou (ce qui n’est de rien plus malaysé) ait la proportion donnée, à ce qui est produit par la multiplication des autres ; on peut prendre à discretion l’vne des deux quantités inconnues ou , et chercher l’autre par cete Equation. en laquelle il est euident que lorsque la question n’est point proposée en plus de cinq lignes, la quantité qui ne sert point à l’expression de la premiere peut touiours n’y auoir que deux dimensions. de façon que prenant vne quantité connuë pour , il ne restera que ou ou . Et ainsi on pourra trouuer la quantité auec la reigle et le compas, en la façon tantost expliquée. Mesme prenant successiuement infinies diuerses grandeurs pour la ligne , on en trouuuera aussy infinies pour la ligne , et ainsi on aura vne infinité de diuers poins, tels que celuy qui est marqué C, par le moyen desquels on descrira la ligne courbe demandée.

Il se peut faire aussy, la question estant proposée en six, ou plus grand nombre de lignes ; s’il y en a entre les données, qui soient paralleles à BA, ou BC, que l’vne des deux quantités ou n’ait que deux dimensions en l’Equation, et ainsi qu’on puisse trouuer le point C auec la reigle et le compas. Mais au contraire si elles sont toutes paralleles, encore que la question ne soit proposée qu’en cinq lignes, ce point C ne pourra ainsi estre trouué, à cause que la quantité ne se trouuant point en toute l’Equation, il ne sera plus permis de prendre vne quantité connuë pour celle qui est nommée , mais ce sera elle qu’il faudra chercher. Et pource qu’elle aura trois dimensions, on ne la pourra trouuer qu’en tirant la racine d’vne Equation cubique. ce qui ne se peut generalement faire sans qu’on y employe pour le moins vne section conique. Et encore qu’il y ait iusques à neuf lignes données, pourvû qu’elles ne soient point toutes paralleles, on peut tousiours faire que l’Equation ne monte que iusques au quarré de quarré. au moyen de quoy on la peut aussy tousiours resoudre par les sections coniques, en la façon que i’expliqueray cy aprés. Et encore qu’il y en ait iusques à treize, on peut tousiours faire qu’elle ne monte que iusques au quarré de cube. en suite de quoy on la peut resoudre par le moyen d’vne ligne, qui n’est que d’vn degré plus composée que les sections coniques, en la façon que i’expliqueray aussy cy aprés. Et cecy est la premiere partie de ce que i’auois icy à demonstrer ; mais auant que ie passe à la seconde il est besoin que ie die quelque chose en general de la nature des lignes courbes.
