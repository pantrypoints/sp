<!-- His progress in these sciences. His particular application to the Analysis of the Ancients, and to the Algebra of the Moderns. He had not read Viète while he was in France.** -->

<!-- **1611. 1612.** -->


Descartes was even less satisfied with the Physics and Metaphysics taught him the following year than he had been with Logic and Morality. 

He was far from blaming his Masters—he who boasted of being at that time in one of the most celebrated schools of Europe, where learned men were bound to be found, if anywhere on earth; and where the Jesuits had probably assembled the best of their Company, to establish the new College in the reputation it afterwards attained. Nor could he lay the fault upon himself, since he lacked nothing for this study—whether in diligence, openness of mind, or inclination. For he loved Philosophy with even more passion than he had loved the Humanities, and esteemed all the exercises carried out both in private and in public within the College, though he already found himself beset by doubts and errors, instead of that clear and assured knowledge of everything useful to life, which he had been made to hope for from his studies.

The further he advanced, the more he discovered his own ignorance. By reading his books and attending his Masters’ lessons, he saw that Philosophy had always been cultivated by the most excellent minds that had ever appeared in the world, and yet that in it there was nothing which was not disputed, and which consequently was not doubtful. The esteem he had for his Masters did not make him presumptuous enough to hope that he could succeed better than others. Considering the diversity of opinions upheld by learned persons upon the same matter—when, after all, there could never be more than one true opinion—he already accustomed himself to regard as almost false whatever was only plausible.

Had he had but one Master, or had he not been aware of these different opinions among Philosophers, he declares that it would never have occurred to him to withdraw from the number of those who must be content to follow the opinions of others rather than to seek out better ones themselves. He would have been more docile, placing himself among those who, through reason or modesty, judge themselves less capable of discerning truth from falsehood than their Masters or other persons from whom they may learn. But having learned already at College (these are his own words) that nothing so strange and so little believable could be imagined, but that some philosopher had already advanced it, he could not choose any Guide whose opinions seemed preferable to those of others. This is what obliged him, in later times, to clear for himself a new path and to undertake to guide himself.

Despite the obstacles which hindered his mind during the whole course of his Philosophy, he was obliged to finish this career at the same time as the rest of his companions, who had found neither doubts to form, nor difficulties to resolve, in their Master’s notebooks. He was then made to pass on to the study of Mathematics, to which he devoted the last year of his stay at La Flèche. And it seems that this study was to be for him the reward of those he had pursued until then. The pleasure he found in it repaid him abundantly for the pains scholastic Philosophy had caused him; and the progress he made was so extraordinary that the College of La Flèche acquired, through him, the glory of having produced the greatest Mathematician that God had yet brought forth.

What particularly charmed him in Mathematics, above all in Arithmetic and Geometry, was the certainty and evidence of their reasoning. Yet he did not yet understand their true use; and thinking they served only for the mechanical arts, he was astonished that, their foundations being so firm and solid, nothing higher had been built upon them. Among the parts of Mathematics, he chose the Analysis of the Geometers and Algebra to make them the subject of his special application; and the dispensation he had obtained from the Principal Father of the College, freeing him from all the practices of scholastic discipline, provided him the means to plunge into this study as deeply as he wished.

Father Charlet, Rector of the House and his perpetual Director, had procured him, among other privileges, that of remaining long in bed in the mornings—both on account of his frail health, and because he observed in him a mind naturally inclined to meditation. Descartes, who upon awakening found all the powers of his mind gathered and all his senses refreshed by the rest of the night, profited by these favorable moments for meditation. This practice became so habitual that it made for him a manner of studying for the whole of his life; and one may say that it is to these mornings in bed that we owe what his mind has produced of greatest importance in Philosophy and in Mathematics.

Already in College he applied himself to purify and perfect the Analysis of the Ancients and the Algebra of the Moderns. Until then, these two sciences had extended only to extremely abstract matters, which seemed of no use. The first had always been so bound to the consideration of figures that it could not exercise the understanding without greatly fatiguing the imagination. The second had been so tied down to certain rules and symbols, that it had been made into a confused and obscure art, capable only of embarrassing the mind instead of cultivating it. He began then to discover wherein these two sciences were useful, and wherein they were defective. His design was not to learn all the particular sciences which bear the common name of Mathematics, but to examine in general the various relations or proportions that are found in their objects, supposing them only in such subjects as might render their knowledge easier to him.

He remarked that to know them, he would sometimes need to consider them each separately, and sometimes only to retain or comprehend several together. To consider them more distinctly one by one, he thought he should suppose them in lines, because he found nothing more simple, nor more proper to be distinctly represented to his imagination and senses: this was all the use he intended to make of Geometrical Analysis. To retain them, or to comprehend several together, he judged he must express them by the shortest and clearest symbols possible: this was the help he expected from Algebra. By this means, he promised himself to take all that was best in Analysis and Algebra, and to correct all the defects of the one by the other. His work succeeded so happily that later he found a way of employing Analysis continually, not only in Geometry, but in even the most common subjects, where one perceives everywhere this way of reasoning with the justness of mind which this method had acquired for him; and he knew how to make Algebra the key to his Geometry, which he did not wish to leave within the reach of vulgar minds.

It seems this is what may have led some persons to believe that the Geometry employed by Mr. Descartes, to solve an infinity of questions, was nothing else than the Analysis of the Ancients. But those very persons, acknowledging that no trace of this Analysis remained in the world since the Ancients, appear to grant Mr. Descartes the glory of invention in this branch of science, for having unearthed a method that had remained buried and almost unknown to Geometers for so long a time. At least it was not the use he made of Algebra that ought to make him lose the merit of novelty: otherwise, the newest and most unheard-of inventions will no longer have anything new or unheard-of, as soon as one makes use of the letters of the alphabet to express them and make them intelligible to others.

Those who make Mr. Descartes the author of this sort of Algebra, which they call the key of all the liberal arts and all the sciences, and which they esteem the best method that has ever appeared for discerning truth from falsehood, attribute the invention to him from his time at College, when his Master was explaining in class the vulgar Analysis, which in all likelihood was nothing but Algebra. The Sieur Lipstorp affirms that he left all his companions far behind him in this kind of study, and that he went infinitely beyond what his Master could have expected. But he adds an anecdote whose truth seems to rest upon a circumstance that is absolutely false. He says that his Master, unable any longer to propose questions to him to which he did not immediately give solutions, and himself embarrassed in resolving those which he allowed his pupil to pose to him, openly confessed that he was thenceforth of no use to him, and that he could teach him nothing more in Algebra that was unknown to him.

One day, having proposed to him the most difficult question he could find, he appeared so astonished at the novelty and subtlety with which Descartes had solved it by means of his new method, that he could not recover from his amazement except by saying that he believed Viète had written something on the subject. Descartes, delighted to learn that he had been anticipated in this invention, begged his Master earnestly to procure him a Viète. 

Lipstorp adds that Descartes, finding something abstruse and difficult to decipher in that author, respectfully pressed his Master to help him; but the Master excused himself on the ground of the difficulty of the passage, saying he knew only one man capable of understanding Viète’s Analysis; but that, after all possible searches, this much-desired man was not to be found. This, he says, led Descartes to rest content with what he had himself invented in Analysis, independently of Viète’s invention, and to rely upon his own genius in whatever he might invent or discover thereafter.

But this might have been Lipstorp’s imagination.

Descartes wrote in a letter written from Holland to Father Mersenne in 1639 that he did not even remember ever having seen so much as the cover of Viète while he was in France. 

He said this to convict of falsehood a Geometer he did not know, but who boasted of having studied Viète with him in Paris. 

He was still less likely to have seen Viète himself than his writings, since that great mathematician, a native of Fontenay-le-Comte in Poitou, who held an office of maître des requêtes in Paris, had died as early as 1603.





<!-- Among the advantages of residing in colleges, one may count the opportunities that arise there of forming connections and habits with those who share the same place of life and study. It is in colleges that the seeds are sown of the strongest and most enduring friendships. Often even the hostilities, jealousies, and enmities of children are turned into goodwill and friendship, when reason and the length of years have corrected what might have been defective in the memory of having lived together.

The number of friends Descartes made at La Flèche may have been quite large; but only two or three remain of whom we have any knowledge. The first was one named Monsieur Chauveau, about whose adventures he himself seems to have been ignorant. “I once knew,” he wrote in a letter of 1641, “a Monsieur Chauveau at La Flèche, who was from Melun. I should like to know whether this is not the same man who teaches mathematics in Paris. But I believe he became a Jesuit, and he and I were great friends.” Whatever may be the case of Father Chauveau the Jesuit, of whom we know nothing, it can be noted that Descartes maintained a friendship with Monsieur Chauveau the mathematician from the publication of his earliest works until his death; and in 1649 he was still speaking of him as a man with whom he had conversed in Paris about various points on which he did not agree with Monsieur de Roberval.

The other college friend was the famous Father Marin Mersenne, a Minim friar, whom Father Rapin did not hesitate to call Descartes’ “resident” in Paris. Mersenne was seven and a half years older, having been born on September 8, 1588, in the small village of Oizé in Maine.

He had made considerable progress in the humanities at the college in Le Mans, when the news of the establishment of the college of La Flèche led his parents, who lived only three leagues away, to recall him there. He came to study at almost the same time as Descartes, and there he learned rhetoric, philosophy, and mathematics. The difference in their ages and studies did not, no doubt, allow them to form a close bond during their time at the college; and it is probable that, Mersenne having left for the Sorbonne, they were for quite some time without hearing of each other. But the friendship they afterwards maintained in a correspondence interrupted only by the death of one of them had its foundations in their earlier acquaintance at the college.

We might also include among those Descartes had known at La Flèche René Le Clerc, later bishop of Glandèves, who, like him, had been one of the first pupils of the new college. But he had come already much advanced in age, like Father Mersenne, and we see no sign that Descartes in later years maintained any particular relationship with this prelate.

Descartes was in his first year of philosophy when the news of the king’s death brought the exercises of the college to a halt. That good prince, in giving his house at La Flèche to the Jesuits, had expressed the wish that his heart, that of the queen, and of all his successors, should be carried there after their deaths and preserved in their church. So the time which elapsed from this sad news until the transport of the king’s heart—about fifteen days—was spent in public prayers, funeral compositions in verse and prose, and the preparations for receiving this precious deposit.

On Saturday, May 15, the day after the king’s death, Monsieur de La Varenne summoned Father Coton to the Louvre, where the body was being embalmed, in order to take the heart, which Father Jaquinot, superior of the house of Saint Louis, received from the hands of the Prince de Conti. The heart remained in the private chapel of the Jesuits of Paris for three days, and on the eve of Ascension it was exposed to public view in their church until the Monday after Pentecost. On that day, the last of May, Father Armand, Provincial, accompanied by twenty Jesuits and several lords of the court, transported the heart to La Flèche, where a great crowd from the surrounding regions had gathered for its reception.

According to the ceremonial planned at the college for the funeral pomp, the provost and his archers went out first to meet the heart. Then followed twelve hundred students of the college, the Recollect fathers, and nineteen parishes from outside, followed by that of the town itself. The Jesuits of the royal college, in surplices and each carrying a candle, came next. Then Monsieur de La Varenne, with the Baron de Sainte-Suzanne his son, and twenty-four noble students at the college, among whom was Descartes. After them came the officers of justice and the townsmen, all carrying white torches. The entire procession went outside the town to receive the heart in a large meadow. The Jesuits of Paris joined those of La Flèche, and Father Armand took the heart, which until then had been placed on a cushion. Preceded by a herald-at-arms, accompanied by two officers and escorted by twelve guards with pistols in hand, he carried it, supported by two men holding his arms, followed by all the secular dignitaries. When they arrived at the church of Saint Thomas, the service was held, and Father Coton gave the funeral oration. Then the Duke of Montbazon took the heart from Father Armand, bore it to the Jesuit college, where in the middle of the great courtyard an arch had been erected, twenty-seven feet high and twenty-six wide. Through its opening one passed into the great hall hung with velvet, which thereafter served as a chapel. The college was draped in mourning, as were the city gate and the church of Saint Thomas. But beyond the escutcheons, skulls, tears, and silver fleurs-de-lis, there were also emblems, mottoes, and epigrams—compositions in which one can scarcely doubt that Descartes, given his taste and talent for verse, had a hand.

At the two corners of the altar stood columns covered with burnished gold, with an arch rising from their capitals to the ceiling, crossed by a cornice from which a golden flower with branches issued to support the king’s heart. The herald, mounted on a platform, received it from the hands of the Duke of Montbazon, raised it to show it to the whole assembly, and after the cry was repeated three times, placed it on the flower to remain there until the urn was completed, in which it would be placed before the high altar of the church.

This ceremony was performed on June 4, and it was decreed in the town hall of La Flèche that on the same day every year a solemn procession would be held from the church of Saint Thomas to the Jesuits; that on returning there would be a solemn service for the king’s soul; and that this day would henceforth be a holiday, with court sessions, college classes, and town shops all closed.

On the following Monday, June 7, classes reopened for the ordinary exercises of the college, and Descartes resumed the study of moral philosophy, which his professor had begun to dictate in April. Logic, which he had studied throughout the preceding winter, was of all parts of philosophy that to which he later testified he had applied himself most in college. One must have acquired as much authority as he now enjoys in the world, to make probable the account he has given of his progress in logic. Not yet fourteen, he was already referring all that he studied to the end he had proposed for himself: to know all that could be useful to life. Even then he perceived that syllogisms and most of the other lessons of school logic served less to learn the things one wished to know than to explain to others the things one already knew—or even to speak without judgment of things one was ignorant of, which is the effect attributed to the art of Raymond Lull.

Yet he acknowledged in logic many rules that were very true and good; but he found them mixed with many others that he judged harmful or superfluous, and he had as much difficulty in separating them as a sculptor might have in extracting a Diana or a Minerva from a block of marble not yet rough-hewn. Of all the many rules he had received from his teachers in logic, he retained only the four which became the foundation of his new philosophy:

1. To accept nothing as true that he did not clearly know to be such.
2. To divide each problem into as many parts as possible for its better solution.
3. To conduct his thoughts in order, beginning with the simplest and easiest objects to know, and ascending step by step to the knowledge of the more complex.
4. To make such complete enumerations that nothing was omitted.

The moral philosophy he studied at college was not entirely useless to him in later life. Perhaps to the effects of this study one may trace his desires, during moments of indecision, to devote his whole life to the science of living well with God and with his neighbor, renouncing all other knowledge. At least he had learned from this moral teaching to regard the writings of the ancient pagans as splendid and magnificent palaces built only on sand and mud. He noted even then that those ancients, in their morality, exalted virtue very highly, making it appear more estimable than anything else in the world; but that they did not teach enough how to recognize it, and that what they called by so fine a name was often no more than insensibility, pride, despair, or parricide. But we do not know whether it was to the scholastic morality of his teachers that he owed the four maxims in which he made all his own morality consist:

1. To obey the laws and customs of his country, while firmly retaining the religion in which God had caused him to be born.
2. To be firm and resolute in his actions, following as constantly even the most doubtful opinions, once he had determined upon them, as if they were the most certain.
3. To strive to conquer himself rather than fortune, to change his desires rather than the order of the world, and to persuade himself that nothing is wholly in our power but our own thoughts.
4. To choose, if he could, the best occupation among those which engage men in this life, and to resolve, without blaming others, upon that of cultivating his reason and advancing as far as possible in the knowledge of truth.
