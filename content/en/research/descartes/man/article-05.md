<!-- 5. Quod autem ad illa animalia, quae pulmone prorsus carent, unum tantum in corde ventriculum habent, vel si pluribus gaudeant, continui sunt.Fig. II. et III.

6. Pulsus arteriarum dependet ab undecim pelliculis, quae valvularu minstar claudunt recluduntque introitus quatuor vasorum binis cordis ventriculis respondentium. Fig. IV. et V.Etenim pulsuum horum uno cessante, simul atque alius praesto est, valvulae duarum arteriarum orificiis affixae quàm exactissimè clausae deprehenduntur : illae verò quę in introitu duarum venarum, apertae. Ut fieri nequeat, quin duae sanguinis guttae ex duabus illis venis confestim elabantur : Altera videlicet in dextrum : Altera in sinistrum cordis ventriculum. 

Hae autem deinceps sanguinis guttae illicò rarefactae in spatium longè majus, quàm antè occupaverant, extenduntur : adeoque premunt clauduntque valvulas in duarum venarum introitu constitutas, eâque ratione simul impediunt, ne uberiori sanguinis copia cor obruatur : propellunt verò recluduntque duarum arteriarum valvulas, in quas promptè et vi quadam ex corde irrumpant. Unde fit, ut cor omnesque totius corporis arteriae simul intumescant. Sed rarefactus hic sanguis iterum è vestigio condensatur, aut alias partes penetrat : facitque adeo ut cor et arteriae detumescant, et valvulae in duarum arteriarum orificiis sitae claudantur, aliae verò in duarum venarum introitu rursus aperiantur, atque transitum praebeant binis sanguinis guttis, quibus cor et arteriae, haud secus quàm praecedentibus, denuò distendantur.


7. Causâ pulsus arteriarum cognitâ, non est intellectu difficile, non tàm illum sanguinem, qui in illius machinae venis continetur, quique recens ab hepate transfunditur, quàm illum, qui arteriis inest, quique jam in corde suo perfectus est, aliis ejus partibus agglutinari, atque inservire, ut restauretur quicquid continuus earum motus variaeque aliorum, quae circumstant, corporum actiones expellunt. Sanguis enim in venis 

contentus ab earum extremitatibus ad cor sensim refluit juxta dispositionem valvularum quarundam, quas Anatomici variis in locis infixas venis observarunt, ut manifestè satis constet idem nobis accidere. E contrà verò sanguis arterias occupans vi quadam atque pluribus pulsibus à corde ad earum extremitates propellitur, ut omnibus ejus membris facilè jungatur, et uniatur, adeoque in iisdem sistatur, eaque proinde nutriat ; quin etiam augeat, si machina humanum corpus ad hoc dispositum referat. -->

<!-- Animals which have no lungs at all have only one cavity in the heart. -->

## 5. Some animals entirely lack lungs and have only one ventricle in their heart. 

If they have multiple ventricles, these are all consecutive to each other.


## 6. The pulse, or beat of the arteries, depends on the 11 little membranes. 

These function as valves, opening and closing the entrances of the 4 vessels connected to the 2 ventricles of the heart. 


<!-- These blood droplets are then immediately rarefied and expand into a space much larger than they previously occupied, thereby pressing against and closing the valves at the entrances of the two veins, 
 They then open the valves of the two arteries, through which they promptly and forcefully rush from the heart. As a result, the heart and all the arteries of the entire body swell simultaneously. But this rarefied blood then quickly condenses again or penetrates other parts, causing the heart and arteries to subside, while the valves at the orifices of the two arteries close, and those at the entrances of the two veins open once more, allowing passage for the two blood droplets that once again distend the heart and arteries just like their predecessors.
 -->

When one of these beats ceases, another is about to begin. At that moment:
- the little doors which are at the entrances of the 2 arteries are exactly closed
- those which are at the entrances of the 2 veins are opened

In this way, 2 drops of blood fall through these 2 veins, one into each cavity of the heart. 

 <!-- it is impossible for the blood from the two veins to flow out immediately: one droplet into the right ventricle and another into the left ventricle of the heart. rarefied-->

These drops of blood then become decompresed and suddenly spread out into a larger space to occupy it.

They push and close those valves at the entrances of the 2 veins.

This prevents any more excess blood from going down into the heart. 

They then push and open the valves of the 2 arteries, through which they promptly and forcefully rush from the heart.

This makes the heart and all the arteries of the body swell at the same time.

But immediately afterwards, this decompressed blood condenses again, or enters the other parts. 

And so the heart and arteries swell up:
- the valves at the 2 entrances of the arteries close again
- those at the entrances of the 2 veins open again. 

This gives passage to two other drops of blood, which again swell up the heart and arteries, just as the previous ones did.


## 7. The blood restores whatever is expelled by the continuous movement of surrounding bodies. 

The 2 kinds of blood are:
- The blood in the veins is freshly transferred from the liver.
- The blood in the arteries and already perfected in the heart.

The cause of the arterial pulse explains how these 2 kinds of blood:
- adheres to other particles of the blood
- restores whatever was expelled from the continuous actions and movement of these parts.

 <!-- and various  of other surrounding bodies expel.  -->

The blood contained in the veins flows back slowly from their extremities to the heart, according to the arrangement of certain valves embedded in various locations within the veins.

<!-- which anatomists have observed -->
<!-- , so it is sufficiently clear that the same happens to us.  -->
<!-- with a certain force and -->

Conversely, the blood in the arteries is propelled through multiple pulses from the heart to the extremities of the arteries.
- In this way, the blood easily unites with all its parts and thus is retained in them.
- This nourishes and even increases them.

<!-- , if the machine of the human body is arranged for this purpose. -->
