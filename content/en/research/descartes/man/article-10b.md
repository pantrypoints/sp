<!-- I will explain the structure of the nerves and muscles. I will show how  -->

The animal spirits in the brain try to enter a nerve and immediately have the power to move a limb. 

<!-- Afterwards, I will demonstrate how the sense organs are affected by external objects.  -->

<!-- Finally, I will explain in detail all the activities carried out in the brain's cavities and pores, where the animal spirits tend to go, and what our functions are, which this machine can imitate with their help. -->

<!-- If I were to start with the brain and follow the course of the spirits, as I previously traced the flow of blood, other matters would be less clear.  -->

For example, Nerve `A` has an outer membrane or sheath that is like a wide tube with several other tubes inside it, such as `b, c, k, l`, etc., which consist of an inner and thinner sheath. 

{{< img src="/graphics/bio/fig06-10.jpg" alt="Brain stem" >}}



Both sheaths are continuous with the two, `K L`, which envelop the brain `M N O`.

{{< img src="/graphics/bio/fig07-10.jpg" alt="Brain stem" >}}

Each of these tubes contains a kind of marrow, which consists of numerous very thin filaments arising from the substance of the brain `N`, whose ends terminate in different places.

- One part ends on its inner surface facing the ventricles of the brain
- The other part ends in the membranes and flesh where the tube that contains these filaments ends. 

This marrow does not cause movement of the limbs, and so it does not fill the tubes in such a way as to leave no room for the animal spirits. 

This gives them enough space to flow easily from the brain into the muscles to which these tubes or nerves extend to.

The small nerve `B` `F` enters muscle `D` which moves the eye. That muscle has many small branches enveloped in a loose membrane.
- The aminal spirits divide into those many branches.
- This membrane can expand or contract depending on the amount of animal spirits entering or leaving the muscle.

The muscle swells and contracts when the spirits enter these fibers, pulling the attached eye towards it.

When the spirits exit, the muscle deflates, relaxes, and extends.

Besides the tube `B F`, there is another tube, `E F`, through which the animal spirits are conveyed into muscle `D` and another tube, `D G`, through which they can exit.

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/eyeball.png" a="Eyeball" >}}


Similarly, muscle `E`'s function is to move the eye in the opposite direction. It receives animal spirits from the brain through tube `C G` and from muscle `D` through `G`. They are returned to muscle `D` through `E F`.

There is no clear passage for the spirits in the muscles `D` and `E` to exit, except for where they flow back and forth between each other.

But the particles of these spirits become more and more refined due to their agitation. This allows them to continuously seep through the membranes and parenchyma of the muscles. 

However, other spirits flow down through the two tubes `B F` and `C G` to replace the lost spirits.

Finally, membrane `H F I` separates tubes `B F` and `E F`. It has 2 valves `H` and `I`. 

When the animal spirits try to descend from `B` towards `H` with greater force than those trying to ascend from `E` towards `I`, they depress and open this valve. This allows the spirits in muscle `E` to quickly flow into muscle `D`. 

But when the spirits trying to ascend from `E` towards `I` are stronger, or even if they are equally strong, they lift and close the membrane or valve `H F I`. This prevents the spirits from exiting muscle `E`. 

If neither side has enough force to pass through the membrane, it naturally remains open.

If the spirits in muscle `D` try to exit through `D F E` or `D F B`, the `H` valve can expand and block their path. 

Similarly, a similar valve is in between tubes `C G` and `D G`. This can be closed by the spirits coming from tube `D G` and opened by those flowing from `C G`.

If the animal spirits existing in the brain do not flow through `B F` and `C G`:
- the two valves `F` and `G` remain partially open or gaping
- the two muscles `D` and `E` remain flaccid and inactive.

This is because the animal spirits in them flow freely from one to the other, starting from `E` through `F` to `D` and reciprocally from `D` through `G` to `E`. 


However, if the spirits contained in the brain exert a force to enter `B F` and `C G`, and the force is equal on both sides, they immediately:
- close both passages `G` and `F`
- inflate the two muscles `D` and `E` as much as possible. 

As a result, the eye is fixed and remains perfectly still in the same position it initially held.

If the spirits leaving the brain flow with greater force through `B F` than through `C G`, they close the membrane or valve `G` and open `F`.

The spirits cannot exit from muscle `D`.

Depending on whether the valve is more or less open, muscle `D` contracts, while `E` stretches.
- This causes the eye to turn towards `D`. 

Conversely, if the spirits leaving the brain flow with greater force through `C G` than through `B F`, they close the membrane `F` and open `G`.
- In this way, the spirits from muscle `D` immediately flow back into muscle `E`.
- This causes it to contract and pull the eye towards itself.

These spirits are very similar to a small refined flame. 

They rush rapidly from one muscle to another as soon as they are given an exit.
<!-- In this matter, there is no need to imagine any other force that propels them except for  -->
- The mere effort to continue their motion according to the laws of nature is the force that propels them.

These spirits are very mobile and subtle. They can inflate, stretch, and thus harden the muscles they are in. 

This is similar to air in a leather bellows:
- makes it more swollen and harder
- stretches the hides it contains.

Whatever has been explained about nerve `A` and the muscles `D` and `E` applies to all other nerves and muscles.


<!-- It is through this manufacture alone that the spiritsin the brain present themselves to enter into some nerves, they have the force to move at the same moment some member.

Then, having touched upon respiration, and such other simple and ordinary movements, I shall say how external objects act against the organs of the senses; 

After that I shall explain in detail all that is done in the cavities and pores of the brain, how the animal spirits take their course there, and what are those of our functions which this machine can imitate by their means.

For if I begin with the brain, and only follow the course of the spirits in order, as I have done that of the blood, it seems to me that my discourse could not be at all so clear.

The outer skin is like a large pipe which contains several other small pipes b, c, k, 1, etc.

Inside each of these small tubes is a kind of marrow composed of several very fine threads which come from the own substance of the brain N. Their extremities end on the one side at its inner surface which looks at its concavities, and on the other at the skins and flesh against which the tube which contains them ends. 

This marrow does not cause any movement of the limbs. It does not fill the small tubes that contain it to such an extent that the animal spirits do not find enough room to flow easily from the brain into the muscles, where these small tubes, which must here be counted as small nerves, go.

See after this how the pipe, or little nerve bf goes into the muscle D supposes to be one of those which move the eye; and how it divides into several branches, composed of a loose skin, which can expand, or widen and shrink, according to the quantity of animal spirits that enter or leave it, and whose branches or fibers are so arranged, that when the animal spirits enter it, they cause the whole body of the muscle to swell and swell, and thus pull the eye to which it is attached; 

as, on the contrary, when they come out of it, this muscle loosens and lengthens. Moreover, see that besides the pipe bf, there is still another, namely ' ef, by which the animal spirits can enter the muscle D, and another, namely dg, by which they can leave it.

And that all the same muscle E, which I suppose serves to move the eye quite contrary to the preceding one, receives the animal spirits from the brain through the tube cg, and from muscle D through dg, and sends them back to D through ef.

Although there is no obvious passage through which the spirits contained in the two muscles D and E can leave them, except to enter from one into the other, nevertheless, because their parts are very small, and even because they are constantly becoming more and more subtle by the force of their agitation, some of them always escape through the skins and flesh of these muscles, but on the other hand, some of them also always return through the two pipes bf, cg.

Finally, between the 2 pipes bf, ef, there is a certain small skin Hfil which separates these 2 pipes. It serves as a door for them, which has two folds H and i. 

When the animal spirits which tend to descend from b to H have more strength than those which tend to ascend from e to i, this door lowers and opens this skin. This lets those which are in the muscle £ to flow with them very rapidly towards D. 

But when those who tend to rise from e to i are stronger, or only when they are as strong as the others, they raise and close this skin Hfi. This prevents themselves from coming out of the muscle £; instead of which, if they do not have enough strength on both sides to push it, it naturally remains ajar. 

If sometimes the spirits contained in the muscle D tend to come out of it by dfe, or dfb, the fold H can extend, and block their passage; 

All the same between the two pipes cg, dg, there is a small skin or valve g, similar to the preceding one, which remains naturally ajar, and which can be closed by the spirits qfc coming from the pipe dg, and opened by those which come from cg. 

If the animal spirits which are in the brain do not tend, or hardly at all, to flow through the pipes bf, cg, the two little skins or valves f and g remain ajar, and so the two muscles D and £ are loose and without action; so long as the animal spirits which they contain pass freely from one to the other, taking their course from e through f to d, and conversely from d through g to e. 

But if the spirits which are in the hoop tend to enter with some force into the two pipes bf, cg, and this force is equal on both sides, they immediately close the two passages g and f, and swell the two muscles D and E as much as they can, making them by this "means hold and stop the eye firm in the situation they find it.


Then if these spirits which come from the brain tend to flow with more force through bf than through cg, they close the little skin g, and open f, and this more or less, according to whether they act more or less strongly; by means of which the spirits contained in the muscle go to the muscle D, through the channel ef; and this more or less quickly, according to whether the skin f is more or less open; so that the muscle D, from which these spirits cannot come out, becomes shorter, and E becomes longer; and thus the eye is turned towards E. 

As, on the contrary, if the spirits which are in the brain tend to flow with more force through cg than through bf, they close the little skin f, and or vrent g; so that the spirits of the muscle D return at once through the channel dg into the muscle E, which by this means shortens, and withdraws the eye from its side. For you know well that these spirits, being like a very subtle wind or flame, cannot fail to flow very rapidly from one muscle into another, as soon as they find some passage, even though there is no other power that carries them there than the only inclination they have to continue their movement according to the laws of nature. 

Even though they are very mobile and subtle, they are strong enough to swell and stiffen the muscles in which they are enclosed, just as the air in a balloon hardens it and makes the skins that hold it taut.

Now it is easy for you to apply what I have just said about nerve A, and the two muscles D and E, to all the other muscles and nerves; and thus to hear how the machine of which I speak can be moved in all the same ways as our bodies by the mere force of the animal spirits which flow from the brain into the nerves: for for each movement, and for its opposite, you can ima gine two small nerves, or pipes, such as are bf y cg^ and two others such as are dg, ef, and two "small doors or valves such as are Hfi and g. 

These tubes are inserted in the muscles in thousands of ways*. But it is not difficult to judge what they are, knowing what anatomy can teach you of the external shape and use of each muscle. 

For example, the eyelids are moved by 2 muscles:

1. `T` serves only to open the upper one
2. `V` serves alternately to open and close them both

They receive the spirits through 2 pipes `pu` and `qs`. 
- One of these 2 pipes `PR` goes into these 2 muscles.
- The other `qs` goes into one of them only.

The branches `r` and `s` are almost inserted in the same way into the muscle `V`, have however two quite opposite effects there, because of the diverse disposition of their branches or of their fibers; which is enough to make you understand the others.

The animal spirits can cause some movements in all the members where some nerves end, even if there are many where anatomists do not notice any visible ones.

Examples are in the:
- eye
- heart
- liver
- gall bladder
- spleen
- etc. -->
