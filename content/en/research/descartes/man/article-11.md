<!-- 11. In order to understand more distinctly how this machine breathes, it must be noted that muscle D is one of those that lift the chest or depress the diaphragm, while its antagonist is muscle E. The animal spirits occupying the cavity of the brain M flow out through the small channel N, which is always kept open as required by nature, and they are immediately directed into the tube B F, depressing the valve F. This causes the spirits contained in muscle E to advance and stretch muscle D with their expulsion.

It should also be noted that as muscle D is more fully inflated, it is increasingly compressed by the membranes surrounding it, which are arranged so that before all the spirits entering muscle E reach muscle D, they slow down their course and seem to flow back through tube B F. Therefore, those in channel M N are deflected and sent through tube C G, which they open at that moment, inflating muscle E and emptying muscle D. They continue to do this as long as the force with which the spirits in muscle D are pressed by the surrounding membranes persists and try to leave.

When this force is no longer as effective, the spirits spontaneously resume their course through tube B F. Hence, these two muscles swell and deflate alternately without ever stopping. The same applies to the other muscles serving the same function. Thus, it is clear that they are all arranged in such a way that when those similar to muscle D inflate, the space containing the lungs is extended, allowing air to enter them, just as air rushes into a bag when its sides are pulled apart. But if the antagonistic muscles of these muscles swell, that space is contracted, and therefore, air is expelled.

12. Additionally, to understand how this machine swallows food contained at the back of the mouth, one must consider that muscle d is one of those that lift the root of the tongue and keep open the entrance to the trachea, through which the air that is breathed enters, while muscle e is its antagonist, meant to close this passage. This muscle, at the same time, opens the esophageal entrance so that the food contained in the mouth can descend into the stomach, and it propels it there by lifting the tip of the tongue. Moreover, the animal spirits flowing from the cavity of the brain M through the pore or channel N, which is naturally always open, are all directly delivered to the tube B F, causing muscle D to swell and remain always in this state of turgescence when no food is found at the back of the mouth to press against it. Furthermore, this muscle is arranged so that as soon as any food is present, it immediately returns the spirits it contains through the tube B F and enables the spirits arriving through the channel N to enter muscle e through the tube C G, where they also tend to enter muscle D. This opens the esophagus and allows the food to descend into the stomach. Shortly afterward, the spirits of channel N resume their course through B F as before.

From this, it can naturally be inferred, with proper analogy, how this machine sneezes, yawns, coughs, and performs various other necessary movements for expelling excretions.

## 11. The muscle for breathing `D` raises its chest, or lowers its diaphragm. 

The muscle `E` is its opposite. 

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/fig_10-10.jpg" a="Muscle" >}}


The pore or small channel marked `n` naturally remains always open.

The animal spirits which are in the concavity of its brain marked `m`, flows through that pore towards pipe `BF` which  lowers the small skin `F`. 

There they cause those of the muscle `E` to come to swell the muscle `d`.

There are certain skins around this muscle `d` which press it more and more as it swells.

<!-- , and which are so disposed that  -->

Before all the spirits of the muscle `d` have passed towards it, they stop their course and make them flow through the tube `BF`, so that those of the canal `n` are turned away from it.

This makes them go to the tube `cg`, which they open at the same time. This causes:
- the muscle `E` to swell
- the muscle `d` to swell down.

This they continue to do as long as the impetuosity lasts, from which the spirits contained in muscle `d`, pressed by the skins which surround it, tend to emerge. 

Then, when this impetuosity has no more force, they resume their course through tube B F, and thus do not cease to make these two muscles swell and deflate alternately. 

What you must also judge of the other muscles which serve the same purpose. 

They are all so arranged, that, when it is the sembla bles to `d` which swell, the space which contains the lungs widens, which is the cause of the air entering from in, just as in a bellows which is opened; and that, when it is their opposites, this space narrows, which is the cause of the air coming out.



## 12. How does the body swallow the meats which are at the bottom of its mouth?

Muscle `D`:
- raises the root of its tongue
- holds open the passage by which the air which it breathes must enter its lung

Muscle `L`:
- closes this passage
- opens that which connects the mouth to the stomach
- raises:
  - the point of her tongue which pushes them there
  - the animal spirits which come from the concavity of her brain `m`, by the pore or small channel `n`, which remains naturally.

This muscle always remains so swollen while there is no meat at the bottom of the mouth that can press it/

But when there is some meat, its spirits immediately flow through the `BF` pipe.
- This causes those that come through the channel `n` to enter through the `CG` pipe into the muscle `E`, where they also go to the muscle `D`. 

This makes the throat open and the food descend into the stomach.

Then afterwards, the spirits of the channel `n` resume their course through `BF` as before. 

This is also how the body can sneeze, yawn, cough, and make the movements necessary to throw various other excrements.

<!-- To hear after this how it can be induced by the external objects which strike the organs of its senses, to move in a thousand other ways all its members, think that the little nets which I have already told you come from the innermost part of its brain, and compose the medulla of its nerves, are so arranged in all those parts of it which serve as an organ for some sense, that they can very easily be moved there by the objects of its senses. 

When they are moved so much, they pull at the same moment the parts of the brain from which they come, and open by the same means the entrances of certain pores which are in the interior surface of this brain by which the animal spirits which are in its conca vities begin at once to take their course, and go to make by them in the nerves and in the iriuscles, which serve to make in this machine movements quite similar to those to which we are naturally incited when our senses are touched in the same way. As, for example, if the fire A' is near the foot B, the small parts of this fire, which move, as you know, very quickly, have the force to move with itself the part of the skin of this foot^ that they touch; and, by this hub, pulling the little net cc, which you see attached to it, they open at the same time the entrance of the pore of, against which this little net ends, as, pulling one of the ends of a rope, one makes ring at the same time the bell which hangs at the other end.

The entrance of the pore or little conduit of being thus opened, the animal spirits of the concavity F enter into it, pts are carried by it, partly in the muscles which serve to withdraw this foot from this fire, partly in those which serve to turn the eyes and the head to look at it, and partly in those which serve to bring the hands forward and to bend the whole body to give help. 

But they can also be carried, by this same conduit, into several other muscles; and", before I stop to explain to you more exactly in what way the animal spirits follow their course through the pores of the brain, and how these pores are arranged, I want to speak to you here in par ticular of all the senses, such as they are in this machine, and to tell you how they are brought to ours.

Know, then, first of all, that there are a great number of small nets similar to these, which all begin to separate from one another from the inner surface of his brain, from which they originate, and which, going from there to spread throughout the rest of his body, serve there as a channel for the sense of touch. 

For, even though it is not usually they who are immediately touched by external objects, but the skins which surround them", there is however no more appearance of thinking that it is these skins which are the organs of the sense, than of thinking, when one handles some body being gloved, that it is the gloves which serve to feel it.

Notice that even though the nets of which I speak are very loose, they do not let themselves pass surely from the brain to the members which are farthest from it, without there being anything between two which breaks them or prevents their action by pressing them, although these members bend however in a thousand different ways, inasmuch as they are enclosed in the same little pipes which carry the animal spirits into the muscles, and that these spirits, always swelling these pipes somewhat, prevent them from being pressed there, and even that they always make them stretch as far as they can, by drawing from the brain, from which they come, towards the places where they end. 

When God unites a reasonable soul with this machine, He will give it its principal seat in the brain. He will make it of such a nature that, according to the various ways in which the entrances of the pores which are on the inner surface of this brain are opened through the intermediary of the nerves, it will have various feelings.

As, first of all, if the little threads that make up the medulla of these nerves are pulled with such force that they break off and separate from the part to which they were joined, so that the structure of the whole machine is in some way less accomplished, the movement that they will cause in the brain will give occasion to the soul, to whom it is important that the place of its dwelling be used, to have the feeling of pain.
And if they are pulled by a force almost as great as the preceding one, without however breaking or separating in any way from the parts to which they are attached, they will cause a movement in the brain, which, testifying to the good constitution of the other members, will give the soul occasion to feel a certain bodily pleasure which is called tickling, and which, as you see, being very close to pain in its cause, is quite opposite to it in its effect.

If several of these little nets are drawn in equal measure, they will make the soul feel that the surface of the body which touches the limb where they end is polished. 

They will make it feel uneven and rough" if they are drawn unevenly. 

If they are only shaken somewhat apart from each other, as they are continually by the heat which the heart communicates to the other members, the soul will have no feeling of it, nor of all the other actions which are ordinary; but if this movement is increased or diminished in them by some extraordinary cause, its increase will make the soul have the feeling of heat, and its diminution that of coldness; 

Finally, according to the other various ways in which they are moved, they will make it feel all the feelings of the body. Finally, according to the other various ways that they will be moved, they will make him feel all the other qualities which belong to the touch in general, like Vhumidity, the dryness, the heaviness, and similar.

Although they are very loose and easy to move, they are not so loose that they can carry to the brain all the smallest actions that are in nature, but that the least that they bring to it are those of the coarsest parts of the earthly bodies; and even that there may be some of these bodies whose parts, though large enough, will not let themselves slip against these little nets so gently that they will press or cut them off completely, without their action passing to the brain; just as there are certain drugs which have the power to dull or even corrupt those of our limbs against which they are applied, without making us have any feeling. -->
