### 36. The functions of the body are made possible by the heart

The functions of the body are:
- the digestion of food
- the pulse of the heart and arteries
- the nutrition and growth of the limbs
- respiration
- wakefulness and sleep
- the reception of light, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, and other similar qualities in the external sense organs
- the impression of ideas formed within the organ of common sense
- the preservation of these ideas in memory
- the internal movements of desire and passion
- the external movements of all the limbs

These follow in such harmony, both in response:
- to objects presented to the senses and
- to passions and impressions in memory
  - These are imitated as accurately as possible. 

These functions happen through the simple disposition of the organs, just as the movements of a clock or other automatons occur through the arrangement of weights and gears. 

Hence, these movements are caused by the blood and the animal spirits in motion.

<!-- , there is no need to conceive of another soul, whether vegetative or sensitive, or another principle of movement and life, other than  -->

These are from the heat of the fire that constantly burns in its heart.

This fire is of the same nature as physical fire.
