Yesterday’s meditation raised serious doubts which I am unable to resolve. 

I feel like I suddenly dropped into a deep whirlpool that tumbles me around that I canot stand on the bottom nor swim to the top. 

However, I force my way up and try once more to carry out the project that I started yesterday. 

I will set aside anything that is doubtful, and treating it as false. I will do this until I:
- find something certain, or
- become certain that there is no certainty. 

Archimedes said that if he had one firm and immovable point, he could lift the world with a long lever. I too hope for great things if I find just one little thing that is solid and certain.

Everything I see is fictitious. My memory tells me nothing but lies. I have no senses. Body, shape, extension, movement and place are illusions. So what remains true? Perhaps the one fact that nothing is certain!

Still, how do I know that there a something that is not doubtful? 

God gives me the thoughts I am now having. But I might myself be the author of these thoughts. But it follows that I am, at least, something. 

This is very confusing because I have just said that:
- I have no senses and no body
- I am so bound up with a body and senses that one would think that I cannot exist without them.

Thus, there is nothing in the world – no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Yet I exist. <!-- Does it follow that I do not exist either? No it does not follow; for if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. -->

## The Deceiver and 'I'

But a supremely powerful and cunning deceiver deceives me all the time! 

<!-- Even then, if he is deceiving me I undoubtedly exist= let him deceive me all he can, he will never bring it about that  -->

But he can never make me nothing while I think I am something. 

So after thoroughly thinking the matter through I conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, must be true whenever I assert it or think it.

But what is this ‘I’ that must exist? <!--  – I still don’t properly understand what it is; so I am at risk of confusing it with something else, thereby falling into error in the very item of knowledge that I maintain is the most certain and obvious of all. To get straight about what this ‘I’ is, I shall go back and think some more about what I believed myself to be before I started this meditation. --> 

To know this 'I', I will eliminate from those beliefs anything that is uncertain. This will leave me with only beliefs about myself that are certain and unshakeable.

'I' was a man. But what is a man? Is it ‘a rational animal'? No. 

<!-- ; for then I should have to ask what an animal is, and what rationality is – each question would lead me on to other still harder ones, and this would take more time than I can spare. Let me focus instead on the beliefs that spontaneously and naturally came to me whenever I thought about what I was. --> 

## Body Versus Soul 

My first belief was that I had a body. 

The next belief was that:
- I ate and drank
- I moved about
- I engaged in sense-perception and thinking

I thought that these things were done by the soul which I think is thin and filmy – like a wind or fire or ether – permeating my more solid parts. 

I was more sure about the body which is whatever has a definite shape and position, and can occupy a ·region of· space in such a way as to keep every other body out of it. It can be perceived by touch, sight, hearing, taste or smell, and can be moved in various ways.

A body cannot move by itself. It can move only through being moved by other things that bump into it. <!-- It seemed to me quite out of character for a body to be able to initiate movements, or to able to sense and think, and I was amazed that certain bodies – ·namely, human ones· – could do those things. -->

Suppose there is a supremely powerful and malicious deceiver tricks me in every way he can. Now what am I? Can I now claim to have any of the features of a body? 

I find that they are all open to doubt.

What are the features of the soul? Nutrition or movement? Since now I am pretending that I do not have a body, these are mere fictions. Sense-perception? 

One needs a body in order to perceive. When dreaming I have perceived through the senses many things that I later realized I had not perceived in that way. Thinking? At last I have discovered it – thought! This is the one thing that can’t be separated from me. 

I am, I exist – that is certain. 

I exist as long as I am thinking. But perhaps no longer than that; for it might be that if I stopped thinking I would stop existing. I have to treat that possibility as though it were actual, because my present policy is to reject everything that isn’t necessarily true. 

Strictly speaking then, I am simply a thing that thinks – a mind, or intelligence, or intellect, or reason. Still, I am a real, existing thinking thing.

What else am I? 

<!-- I will use my imagination to see if I am anything more. I am not that structure of limbs and organs that is called a human body; nor am --> 

I am not a thin vapour that permeates the limbs – a wind, fire, air, breath, etc. <!-- ; for I have supposed all these things to be nothing because I have supposed all bodies to be nothing. Even if I go on supposing them to be nothing, I am still something. But these things that I suppose to be nothing because they are unknown to me – might they not in fact be identical with the I of which I am aware? I don’t know; and just now I shan’t discuss the matter, because I can form opinions only about things that I know. --> 

I know that I exist. But what is this 'I' that I know? 

My knowledge of it cannot depend on things of whose existence I am still unaware. So it cannot depend on anything that I invent in my imagination. 

The word ‘invent’ shows what is wrong with relying on my imagination in this matter. 

If I used imagination to show that I was something or other, that would be mere invention, mere story-telling. Imagining is simply contemplating the shape or image of a bodily thing. That makes imagination suspect. I know that I exist. I know that everything relating to the nature of body – including imagination – could be mere dreams. 

So it would be silly for me to say ‘I will use my imagination to get a clearer understanding of what I am’. This is as silly as saying ‘I am now awake and see some truth. But I shall deliberately fall asleep so as to see even more, and more truly, in my dreams'! 

If my mind is to get a clear understanding of its own nature, it should not look at the imagination for it.

Well, what am I? 

<!-- A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wants, refuses, and also imagines and senses. -->

<!-- That is a long list of attributes for me to have – and it really is I who have them all. Why should it not be? Isn’t it one and the same ‘I’ who now doubts almost everything, understands some things, affirms this one thing – namely, that I exist and think, denies everything else, wants to know more, refuses to be deceived, imagines many things involuntarily, and is aware of others that seem to come from the senses? 

Isn’t all this just as true as the fact that I exist, even if I am in a perpetual dream, and even if my creator is doing his best to deceive me?  -->

I know 'I' from my activities. But my activities are all aspects of my thinking, and are all inseparable from myself. 

<!-- The fact that it is I who doubt and understand and want is so obvious that I can’t see how to make it any clearer. But the ‘I’ who imagines is also this same ‘I’. 

For even if (as I am pretending) none of the things that I imagine really exist, I really do imagine them, and this is part of my thinking.  -->

Lastly, it is also this same ‘I’ who senses, or is aware of bodily things seemingly through the senses. 

My reality might be a dream.

<!-- Because I may be dreaming, I can’t say for sure that I now see the flames, hear the wood crackling, and feel the heat of the fire; but I certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This cannot be false; what is called ‘sensing’ is strictly just this seeming, and when ‘sensing’ is understood in this restricted sense of the word it too is simply thinking. -->

<!-- All this is starting to give me a better understanding of what I am. But I still can’t help thinking that bodies – of which I form mental images and which the senses investigate –  -->
