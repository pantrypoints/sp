The natural light shows that the total cause of something must contain at least as much reality as does the effect. 

<!-- For where could the effect get its reality from if not from the cause? And how could the cause give reality to the effect unless it first had that reality itself?  -->

Two things follow from this:

1. Something cannot arise from nothing
2. The more perfect is something that in itself has more reality. This cannot come from the less perfect.

This is plainly true for:
- ‘actual’ or ‘intrinsic’ reality, and
- the representative reality of ideas

This representative reality is the reality that an idea represents. A stone, for example, can only exist if its effects match their causes in the stone. <!-- produced by something that contains – either straightforwardly or in some higher form – everything that is to be found in the stone.  -->

Similarly, heat cannot be produced in a cold object that has no heat. <!--  except by something of at least the same order of perfection as heat, and so on.  -->

<!-- I do not say simply ‘except by something that is hot’, because that is not necessary.  -->

The thing could be made hot by something that is not hot and does not contain heat in itself.
- That something contains heat in a higher form

<!-- , that is, something of a higher order of perfection than heat. Thus,  -->

For example, God is not himself hot.
- But he can cause something to be hot because he contains heat not straightforwardly, but in a higher form.*

{{< n n="This is aethereal energy that is the source of material heat" >}}


<!-- or of a stone -->

I can have the idea of heat if I have something in [my mind] that contains the reality for heat. 

<!-- at least as much reality as I conceive to be in the heat or in the stone. -->

<!-- For although  -->

This causal something does not transfer any of its actual or intrinsic reality to my idea of heat.
- But it does not mean that that something cannot be less real. 

The only reality needed by an idea is the reality which comes from my thought.
- This is because my thought is a mode of reality.

 <!-- of which it is a mode. representative-->

Any idea that has a corresponding reality comes from a causal something that has as much intrinsic reality as there is in its representative idea. 

If an idea has something that was not in its cause, then it must have gotten it from nothing. 

But the reality in something’s being represented in the mind by an idea<!-- , though it may not be very perfect, --> certainly is not nothing. This is because something cannot come from nothing.


## The Cause is Not an Idea

The reality in my ideas is merely representative. Some might think that it is connected to  its cause only representatively and not intrinsically. That would mean that the cause is itself an idea.  <!-- because only ideas have representative reality.  -->

But that would be wrong.

Although one idea might originate from another, there cannot be an infinite regress of such ideas. Eventually, one must come back to an idea whose cause is not an idea. This cause must be a kind of archetype containing intrinsically all the reality or perfection that the idea contains only representatively.

So the natural light makes it clear that my ideas are like pictures of real things. These pictures can easily fall short of the perfection of those things and can never exceed them.

<!-- The longer and more carefully I examine all these points, the more clearly and distinctly I recognize their truth.  -->

<!-- But what is my conclusion to be?  -->

This reasoning proves that I am not alone in the world. This is because my ideas are mere representatives of a reality which is outside of me, caused by Something else.  <!-- that I am sure the same reality doesn’t reside in me, either straightforwardly or in a higher form, and hence that I myself can’t be the cause of the idea, then, because everything must have some cause, it will necessarily follow that   -->

<!-- = there exists some other thing that is the cause of that idea. -->

<!-- If no such idea is to be found in me, I shall have no argument to show that anything exists apart from myself; for, despite a most careful and wide-ranging survey, this is the only argument I have so far been able to find. -->

<!-- Among my ideas, apart from the one that gives me a representation of myself, which can’t present any difficulty in this context, there are ideas that variously represent God, inanimate bodies, angels, animals and finally other men like myself.

As regards my ideas of other men, or animals, or angels, I can easily understand that they could be put together from the ideas I have of myself, of bodies and of God, even if the world contained no men besides me, no animals and no angels.

As to my ideas of bodies, so far as I can see they contain nothing that is so great or excellent that it couldn’t have originated in myself. For if I examine them thoroughly, one by one, as I did the idea of the wax yesterday, I realize that the following short list gives everything that I perceive clearly and distinctly in them= size, or extension in length, breadth and depth; shape, which is a function of the boundaries of this extension; position, which is a relation between various items possessing shape; motion, or change in position.

To these may be added substance, duration and number.

But as for all the rest, including light and colours, sounds, smells, tastes, heat and cold and the other qualities that can be known by touch, I think of these in such a confused and obscure way that I don’t even know whether they are true or false, that is, whether my ideas of them are ideas of real things or of non-things. 

Strictly speaking, only judgments can be true or false. But we can also speak of an idea as ‘materially false’ if it represents a non-thing as a thing.  -->

<!-- For example, my idea of cold depends on the idea of heat, and vice versa. These do not depend on material truth.   -->

<!--  on have so little clarity and distinctness that they don’t enable me to know whether cold is merely the absence of heat, or heat is merely the absence of cold, or heat and cold are both real positive qualities, or neither heat nor cold is a real positive quality. -->

<!-- If the right answer is that cold is nothing but the absence of heat, the idea that represents it to me as something real and positive deserves to be called ‘false'; and the same goes for other ideas of this kind. -->

<!-- Such ideas obviously don’t have to be caused by something other than myself. If they are false – that is, if they represent non-things – then they are in me only because of a deficiency or lack of perfection in my nature, which is to say that they arise from nothing; 

I know this by the natural light. If on the other hand they are true, there is no reason why they shouldn’t arise from myself, since they represent such a slight reality that I can’t even distinguish it from a non-thing. -->
