<!-- With regard to the clear and distinct elements in , it appears that I could have -->

My ideas of bodies borrows some elements from my idea of myself:
- substance
- duration
- number
- anything else of this kind. 

These external ideas and causes are made of substance. 

A substance is a thing capable of existing independently.

For example, I think that:
- a stone is a substance
- I am a substance.

I think of:
- myself as a thing that thinks and is not extended [occupy no metaphysical space]
- the stone as a thing that is extended [occupies metaphysical space] and does not think

The two conceptions differ enormously. But they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common. 

I perceive that:
- I exist now
- I have existed for some time
- I have various thoughts that I can count

These perceptions give me the ideas of duration and number that I can then transfer to other things. 

As for all the other elements that make up 

The ideas of bodies are made up elements:
- extension [metaphysical space]
- shape
- position
- movement

These are not in me, since I am just a thinking thing. The ideas of bodies are merely modifications or modes of a substance.

Since I am a substance, it seems possible that they are contained in me in some higher form.*

{{< n n="In Hinduism and Buddhism, this is citta or aethereal mindstuff" >}}


<!-- modes -->

That is, I myself am not extended, shaped etc. But because I am a substance, I am metaphysically one up on these mere modifications. 
- **This implies that I can contain within me whatever it takes to cause the ideas of them.**

External objects come from external ideas, of which the only remaining idea is the <!-- So there remains only --> the idea of God. <!--  is there anything in that which couldn’t have originated in myself?  -->

‘God’ means a substance* that is infinite, eternal, unchangeable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, which created myself and anything else that may exist. 

{{< n n="This would be Citta or the Supreme mindstuff, which is infinite" >}}

<!-- The more carefully I concentrate on these attributes, the less possible it seems that any of them could have originated from me alone. So this whole discussion implies that God necessarily exists. -->

I am also a substance having the idea of substance. But it does not explain my having the idea of an infinite substance since I am finite. That must come from some substance that is infinite.

One might say that this is wrong because my idea of the infinite comes from me negating the finite. <!-- , just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are arrived at by negating movement and light.  -->

<!-- That would be a mistake, however. I clearly understand that  -->

I answer that there is more reality in an infinite substance than in a finite one. Hence, my perception of the infinite, i.e. God, is prior to my perception of the finite, i.e. myself. 

<!-- Whenever I know that I doubt something or want something, I understand that I lack something and am therefore not wholly perfect. How could I grasp this unless I had an idea of a perfect being, which enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison? Nor can it be said that this idea of God could be ‘materially false’, and thus have come from nothing, as may be the case (I noted this a few moments ago) with the ideas of heat and cold. -->

On the contrary, it:
- is utterly clear and distinct
- contains in itself more representative reality than any other idea
  - that is, it stands for something that is grander, more powerful, more real, than any other idea stands for
  - it is less open to the suspicion of falsehood than any other idea. 

This idea of God <!-- a supremely perfect and infinite being is, I say, --> is true in the highest degree. One might imagine that God does not exist. But the idea of God cannot possibly <!--  can’t be supposed that the idea of such a being --> represent and unreal something <!-- in the way that the idea of cold perhaps does -->. 

The idea is utterly clear and distinct. 

It does not matter that I do not totally grasp the infinite, or that there are countless additional attributes of God that I cannot grasp in my thought. This is because the infinite has a nature that cannot be grasped by a finite being like myself. 

It is enough that I understand what is the infinite. <!-- , and that I judge that all the attributes that I clearly perceive and know to imply some perfection – and perhaps countless others of which I am ignorant – are present in God either straightforwardly or in some higher form. -->  This is enough to make my idea of God the truest, clearest and most distinct of all my ideas.

Here is a possible objection to that line of thought. 

Perhaps I am greater than I understand, and will be as perfect as God eventually. <!-- .  perhaps all the perfections that I attribute to God are ones that I do have in some potential form, and they merely haven’t yet shown themselves in actuality. My knowledge is gradually increasing, and I see no obstacle to its going on increasing to infinity. I might then be able to use this increased and eventually infinite knowledge to acquire all the other perfections of God. In that case, I already have the potentiality for these perfections – why shouldn’t this potentiality be enough to enable me to have caused the idea of them that is, to have caused my idea of God·? But all this is impossible for three reasons. -->


But this is wrong for the following reasons:

1. My knowledge and potentialities are increasing. But these are all irrelevant to the idea of God. 

The idea of God contains absolutely nothing that is potential. <!-- Indeed, this gradual increase in knowledge is itself the surest sign of imperfection, because if I am learning more, that shows that there are things I don’t know, and that is an imperfection in me. What is more, -->

2. Even if my knowledge increases forever, it will never actually be infinite since it will never reach the absolute point where it can no longer increase. 

God, on the other hand, is actually infinite. Nothing can be added to his perfection. 

3. Potential being is nothing; what it takes to cause the representative being of an idea is actual being.

<!-- If one concentrates carefully, all this is quite evident by the natural light. But when I relax my concentration, and my mental vision is blurred by the images of things I perceive by the senses, I lose sight of the reasons why my idea of more perfect being has to come from a being that really is more perfect. So I want to push on with my enquiry, now asking a new question:  -->

If God didn’t exist, could I exist? 

The answer to this will give a new proof of God's existence. <!--  of a perfect being – a proof that it will be easier for me to keep in mind even when I relax my concentration. -->

If God did not exist, from what would I derive my existence? 

It would have to come from:
- myself
- my parents
- some other beings less perfect than God<!--  (a being more perfect than God, or even one as perfect, is unthinkable). -->
