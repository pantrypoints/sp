<!-- A rainbow can be created by means of a fountain.

As if the water that comes out of the small holes ABC, jumping high enough, spreads in the air in all directions towards R, and the sun is towards Z, so that ZEM being a straight line the angle MER can be about 42 degrees, the eye E will not fail to see the iris towards R, quite similar to the one that appears in the sky.

To which it must now be added that there are oils, spirits of wine, and other liquids, in which refraction is significantly greater or smaller than in ordinary water, and which are no less clear and transparent. 

So that one could arrange several fountains in order; in which there are various of these liquids, one would see by their means a whole large part of the sky full of the colors of the iris: namely by making the liquids, whose refraction would be the greatest, be the closest to the spectators; and that they do not rise so high that they prevent the view of those that would be behind.

Then because by closing part of the holes ABC one can make disappear such part of the iris RR as one wants, without removing the others, it is easy to understand that in the same way, opening and closing the holes of these various fountains at the right time, we can make what appears colored have the figure of a cross, or a column, or some other such thing, which gives rise to admiration. 

It would take skill and expense to:
- proportion these fountains
- make the liquids jump so high that these figures could be seen from afar by a whole people, without the artifice being discovered.

<!-- But the main difficulty still remained, which was to know why, although  -->

There are many other rays that can reach the eye after 2 refractions and 1-2 reflections when this sphere is in another position. Yet only those that I have spoken of that make some colors appear. 

<!-- And to resolve it, I looked for whether there was not some other subject where they would appear in the same way, so that by comparing one with the other I could better judge their cause. -->

I remembered that a crystal prism makes similar ones appear.

It was like `MNP` here, whose two surfaces `MN` and `NP` are all flat. They are inclined one over the other at an angle of 30-40 degrees. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/prism.jpg" a="candle light" >}}


The rays of the sun `ABC` pass through `MN` at right angles, or nearly right angles. Thus, they do not suffer any noticeable refraction.

But they must be largely refracted when leaving by `NP`. 

I covered one of these two surfaces with an opaque body with a narrow opening like `DE`. I then put a white paper `FGH`

The rays that passed through this opening to the paper paint all the colors of the rainbow on it.

They always paint:
- the red towards `F`
- the blue or violet towards `H`. 

From this I learned:

1. **The curvature of the surfaces of water drops is not necessary to produce these colors.**

This is because the surfaces of this crystal are all flat. 

2. **The size of the angle under which they appear are not necessary.** 

The angle can be changed here without the colors changing.

It can be done so that the rays that go towards `F` bend sometimes more and sometimes less than those that go towards `H`. 

Yet:
- they still paint red always
- those that go towards `H` are always blue. 

There is no reflection either. 

3. **The plurality of refractions is not necessary**

There is only one here. 

But I judged that at least one was needed, and even one whose effect was not destroyed by a contrary one.

If the surfaces `MN` and `NP` were parallel, the rays would not produce these colors because they would straighten in one as they could bend in the other.

<!-- Light was necessary.

; for without it nothing is seen. And besides that I observed that shadow, or limitation to this light was necessary.  -->

**The limitation of this light was necessary.**

If the opaque body that is on `NP` is removed, the colors on the paper cease to appear.

If the opening `DE` is made large enough:
- the red, orange, and yellow, which are towards `F`, do not extend any further 
- the green, blue, and violet, which are towards `H`also do not extend any further
- all the rest of the space which is between two towards `G` remains white.

Why are these colors different towards `H` than towards `F`, although refraction and shadow and light concur in the same way?

This is because of the action or movement of the fire-aether as small balls that **roll in the pores of earthly bodies**.
<!--  And conceiving the nature of light as I have described it in Optics, namely, as 
a certain very subtle matter -->


<!-- These balls can roll in various ways, according to the various causes that determine them there. -->

**All refractions that are made towards the same side make them turn in the same direction.**

**But when they do not have neighbors moving faster or slower than themselves, their rotation is approximately equal to their straight-line motion.**



They form the blue `EH` ray when they have some neighbors on one side that move faster.
- This makes then roll more slowly.

They form the red `DF` ray when they have some neighbors on one side that move slower.
- This makes then roll faster.

 <!-- and on the other that move more or equally quickly, as happens at the confines of shadow and light;  -->

<!-- if they meet those that move less quickly, on the side towards which they roll, as do those that make up the `EH` ray, this is because they do not turn as quickly, that they move in a straight line.

This is opposite when they meet them on the other side as do those of the red `DF` ray.



Whereas when they have on one side neighbors moving slower, and on the other side neighbors moving faster or equally fast, as happens at the boundaries of shadow and light.

if they encounter those moving slower on the side towards which they roll, like those composing the ray `EH`, this causes them to rotate slower.. not to rotate as swiftly as they move straight; 

and it is quite the opposite when they encounter them on the other side, like those of the ray DF." -->
