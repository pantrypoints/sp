<!-- its two sides  and  descend equally quickly toward the surface of the water , where
the movement of the side marked , which encounters it first, is retarded,
while that of side  still continues; 

This makes the ball to rotate following the numbers . 

It is surrounded by four others – , , ,  – also moving towards x. 

 and R move with more a greater force than the ball.

 and  move with less force. 

 presses on the part of the ball marked 
 presses on . These increase its rotation

R and T do not hinder it, because R moves toward X faster than the ball follows it.

T is not disposed to
follow the ball as quickly as it precedes it. 

This explains the action of the ray .

on the other hand, if  and  tend more slowly than it toward , and  and  tend there more rapidly

 hinders the motion of part , and  that of part , without the two others –  and  – doing
anything. This explains the action of the ray .

This ball  is quite round, it can easily happen that, when it
is pressed hard by the two balls  and , it is turned and rotates around
the axis , rather than their causing its rotation to stop.

And so, changing its position in an instant, it subsequently rotates following the numbers
; for the two balls  and , which caused it to begin to rotate, make it
continue until it has completed a half-turn in this direction, and then they
can increase its rotation instead of retarding it.

The nature of the colours appearing at  consists just in the parts of the subtle matter which transmit the action of light having a much greater tendency to rotate than to travel in a straight
line. 

As a consequence, those which have a much stronger tendency to rotate cause the colour red, and those which have only a slightly stronger tendency cause yellow. 

The nature of those that are visible at , on the other hand, consists just in the fact that these small parts do not rotate as quickly as normal, when there is no particular cause hindering them; so
that green appears when they rotate just a little more slowly, and blue
when they rotate very much more slowly. And usually this blue is combined with a pinkish colour at its edges, which makes it vivacious and sparkling, and changes it into violet or purple.

The cause of this is with-out doubt the same as that which usually slows down the rotation of
the parts of the subtle matter when it has enough strength to change the
position of some of them and increase their rotation, while slowing that
of others. -->






To better understand this, imagine that the ball `1234` is pushed from `V` to `X` in a straight line.
- Its two sides `1` and `3` descend equally quickly to the surface of the prism `YY`.
- `3` makes contact with the prism first. This delays its movement while `1` continues.

This makes the ball roll as `1432`.

<!-- is because the whole ball infallibly begins to spin in the order of the numbers `123`. -->

It is surrounded by four others, `Q, R, S, T` during its descent. 
- `Q` and `R` have more force to move towards `C` than `X` has to move towards `B`
- `S` and `T` have less force to move towards `A` than `X` has to move towards `B`
- `Q` presses on `X` through part marked `1` while `S` holds back the part marked `3`
  - This increases the rotation of `X`.

`R` and `T` do not harm it because:
- `R` has already left for `C`.
- `T` has not touched it yet.

<!-- is not disposed to follow it as fast as it precedes it. 

is disposed to move towards `X` faster than it follows it. -->

This explains the action of the `DF` ray.

The opposite happens if:
- `Q` and `R` tend more slowly towards `C` than `X` tends towards `B`.
- `S` and `T` tend stronger towards `A` than `X` tends towards `B`.

In such a case:
- `R` will prevent the rotation of part `1` of `X`
- `T` will prevent that of the part `3`
- `Q` and `S` will not do anything about it. 

This explains the action of the blue `EH` ray.

This ball `1234` is very round. 

When it is pressed a little hard by the two `R` and `T`, it goes rotating in another direction instead of stopping its rotation.

 <!-- back into pirouetting around the axis `42`,  at their occasion. -->

Thus, in changing in a moment of situation, it turns afterwards following the order of the numbers `321` .
- This is because `R` and `T` makes it start to turn away.
- They force it to continue until it has completed a half turn in this direction
- They can increase its rotation, instead of delaying it. 

<!-- This has served me to resolve the main of all the difficulties I have had in this matter. -->

The nature of the colors which appear towards `F` consists only in what the fire-aether tends to spin, with more force than to move in a straight line.

 <!-- parts of the subtle matter, which transmits the action of light, tend  -->
- Those which tend to turn much stronger, cause the red color.
- Those which only tend a little stronger, cause the yellow.


On the contrary, those which are seen towards `H` these small fire-aether particles not spinning as quickly as they are used to.

 <!-- when there is no cause that prevents them.slower much less quickly -->

- Green appears where they do not turn much slower 
- Blue where they turn much slower

At the extremities of this blue there is mixed some incarnate which gives it liveliness and brilliance. 
- It changes it into violet or purple color. 

This is also caused by the delay the rotation of the fire-aether particles which are then strong enough to change the position of some. This increases it in those there, while it decreases the rotation of the others.


<!-- In all this reason agrees so perfectly with experience that I do not believe that it is possible, after having well known the one and the other, to doubt that the thing is not as I have just explained it.  -->

For if it is true that the feeling we have of light is caused by the movement or the inclination to move of some matter that touches our eyes

The different movements of this matter causes different feelings in us.

<!-- ; And as there can be no other diversity in these movements than that which I have said; also we find no -->

The diversity of our feelings of the fire-aether is seen through colors. 

 <!-- by experience in the feelings we have of them, than that of colors. -->

<!-- subtle matter -->
There is nothing in the `MNP` prism that can produce colors, other than how it sends the small particles of the fire-aether towards the `FGH` paper, and from there towards our eyes. 

<!-- from which it seems to me quite evident that one should not look for anything else in the colors that other objects appear: for ordinary experience testifies that  -->

White light and shadow or black, with the colors of the iris which have been explained here, suffice to compose all the others. 

I do not agree when the Philosophers say that:
- some colors are true
- some are false or apparent.

<!-- For all their true nature being only to appear, it seems to me a contradiction, to say that they are false, and that they appear. -->
