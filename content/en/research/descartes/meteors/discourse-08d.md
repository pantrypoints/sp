Let `AFD` be a drop of water.
- Its half diameter `CD` or `AB` is divided into as many equal parts as needed to calculate rays that will attribute as much light to some as to others. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/fig_77.jpg" a="Water Droplets" >}}

Take ray `EF`.
- Instead of going straight towards `G`, it turns towards `K` and reflects from `K` towards `N`.
- From `N` it goes towards the eye `P`

Or reflect it from `N` towards `Q`.
- From there turn towards the eye `R`. 

Draw `CI` at right angles to `FK`.

`AE` or `HF` and `CI` have between them the proportion that measures the refraction of water. 

If `HF` contains 8,000 parts, then:
- `AB` contains 10,000
- `CI` will contain around 5,984

This is because the Refraction of water is slightly greater than 3:4, more like 187:250.

<!-- and for the most precisely that I have been able to measure it, it is .  -->

From the lines `HF` and `CI`, I easily know the 2 arcs:
- `FG` is 73 degrees and 44 minutes
- `FK` is 106. 30. 

Remove twice the arc `FK` from the arc `FG` added to 180 degrees. This leaves 40. 44. for the quantity of the angle `ONP` because I suppose `ON` parallel to `EF`.

Removing these `40. 44` from `FK`, I have `65. 46` for the angle `SQR`. This is because I also pose `SQ` parallel to `EF`. 

We calculate in the same way all the other rays parallel to `EF`, which pass through the divisions of the diameter `AB`:

HF | CI | FG | FK | ONP | SQR

10,000 | 7,480 | 0 | 83.10 | 13.40 | 69.30


In this table that there are many more rays that make the angle ONP of about 40 degrees, than there are that make it less; or SQR of about 54, than there are that make it greater. 

Then in order to make it even more precise I do this table:

I see here that the largest angle `ONP` can be 41 degrees 30 minutes. 

The smallest SQR is `51.54`, to which adding or subtracting about 17 minutes for the half diameter of the sun, I have `41.47` for the largest half diameter of the inner rainbow, and `51.37` for the smallest of the outer one.

When water is hot, its refraction is slightly less than when it is cold, which can change something in this calculation. 

However, this cannot increase the half diameter of the inner rainbow by more than one or two degrees at most. And then, that of the outer one will be almost twice as small.

This demonstrates that the refraction of water cannot be much less or greater than I suppose. 

If it were only a little greater, it would make the half diameter of the inner rainbow less than `41` degrees, instead of which, by common belief, it is given `45` degrees.

If we suppose it small enough to make it really `45`, we will find that that of the outer one will not be much more than `45` either, instead of which it appears to the eye to be much larger than that of the inner one.

Maurolycus was the first to have determined one of `45` degrees. He determines the other to be about `56`. 

**This shows the little faith that should be added to observations that are not accompanied by true reason.**
