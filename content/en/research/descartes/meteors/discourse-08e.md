Red is outside in the inner rainbow and inside in the outer one.

This is based on the same cause for which it appears towards `F`, rather than towards `H`, through the `MNP` prism.

If the eyes is on white linen `FGH` looking at this crystal, he will see:
- red towards its thicker part `MP`
- blue towards `N`

This is because the red-tinted ray that goes to `F` comes from `C`, the part of the sun most advanced towards `MP`. 

This means that the thicker center of the raindrops are:
- outside with respect to the colored points that form the inner rainbow. 
  - This causes red to appear there outside.
- inside with respect to the colored points that form the outer rainbow.
  - This causes the red to appear there inside. 

The only difficulty are the irregularities that occur there. 

Examples are when:
- the arc is not exactly round
- the arc's center is not in the straight line that passes through the eye and the sun. 

These can happen if the winds change the shape of the raindrops. 

<!-- for they cannot lose so little of their roundness that this does not  -->

This makes a notable difference in the angle under which the colors should appear.

We have also seen sometimes, so I am told, a rainbow so overturned that its horns were turned upwards, as is represented here in `FF`.

This is caused by the reflection of the sun's rays falling on the water of the sea or lake. 

As if coming from the part of the sky `SS`, they fall on the water `DAE`.

From there, they reflect towards the rain `CF`. The eye `B` will see the arc `FF`, whose center is at point `C`, so that `CB` being extended to `A`, and `AS` passing through the center of the sun, the angles `SAD` and `BAE` are equal, and the angle `CBF` is about 42 degrees. 

This requires there to be:
- no wind at all to disturb the water's surface towards E
- some cloud, like `G`, which prevents the sunlight going in a straight line towards the rain

In this way, it does not erase the one that this water `E` sends there.
- From which it comes that it happens only rarely.

The eye can be in a position relative to the Sun and the rain that the lower part that completes the circle of the rainbow will be seen, without seeing the upper part.

Thus it will be taken for an overturned arc.

It will not be seen towards the sky, but towards the water, or towards the earth.


A third much weaker rainbow has sometimes been seen above the 2 ordinary ones.
- It was as far from the second as the second was from the first.

This needs very round and very transparent hailstones mixed with the rain.

This would make the refraction greater than in water.

This would make the outer rainbow much larger there, and thus appear above the other.

The inner one which by the same reason should have been smaller than the inner one of the rain, it may be that it will not have been noticed, because of the great luster of this one: or that their ends having joined, they will not have been counted both for one.

But for one whose colors will have been arranged differently than usual.


There is an fountain invention to make signs appear in the sky.

<!-- , which could cause great admiration to those who would not know the reasons.  -->

The water comes out of the small holes `ABC` jumps high and spreads in the air in all directions towards `R`.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/fig_81b.jpg" a="Fountain" >}}


The sun is at `Z` so that `ZEM` is a straight line. The angle `MER` is around 42 degrees.

The eye `E` will see the iris towards `R`, quite similar to the one that appears in the sky. 

There are oils, spirits of wine, and other liquids, in which refraction is significantly greater or smaller than in ordinary water yet just as transparent. 

Several fountains could be arranged so that these liquids, one would see by their means a whole large part of the sky full of the colors of the iris: 

namely by making the liquids, whose refraction would be the greatest, be the closest to the spectators; and that they do not rise so high that they prevent the view of those that would be behind.

Then because by closing part of the holes `ABC` one can make disappear such part of the iris `RR` as one wants, without removing the others.

In the same way, opening and closing the holes of these various fountains at the right time, we can make what appears colored have the figure of a cross, or a column, or some other thing.

<!-- , which gives rise to admiration.  -->

But it would take skill and expense to:
- proportion these fountains
- make the liquids jump so high that these shapes could be seen from afar by a whole people, without the artifice being discovered.
