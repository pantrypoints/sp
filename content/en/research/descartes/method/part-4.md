My first meditations are so metaphysical and so uncommon. They might not be acceptable to everyone. 

The foundations that I have laid are secure. 

Our opinions are <!-- , I find myself in a measure constrained to advert to them. I had long before remarked that, in relation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above doubt, opinions which we discern to be --> highly uncertain. We should <!-- but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the search after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was called for, and that I ought to --> reject as absolutely false all opinions which could be doubted. This is so that we can have solid truths. <!-- in regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order to ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that was wholly indubitable.  -->

Our senses sometimes deceive us. That is why I supposed that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us. 

This is because some men:
- err in reasoning, and 
- fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry

I was as open to error as any other. So I rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken as fact.

The very same thoughts which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep. 

But when asleep, they are not true.

But it means that all the objects (presentations) that I had in my mind when awake were just as false as the illusions of my dreams.

I thus wished to think that all was false even myself who was thinking of it. 


## The Non-Physical Existence

I realized that I think, therefore I exist (cogito ergo sum). This was so certain that it could not be doubted. 

<!-- I concluded that I might accept it as -->

This is the first principle of my philosophy. 

If I had no body, then I would not have any physical existence. But it does not mean that I could not have a [non-physical] existence.  

On the contrary, it most clearly and certainly followed that I could exist [as I could think about it].

On the other hand, if I stopped thinking then I would no longer exist, even if all the other objects which I had imagined retained their existence in reality. 

I thence concluded that:
- I was a substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking
- this substance may exist without physical place, or any material thing
- this “I” is the mind by which I am what I am
  - It is wholly distinct from the body
  - It is even more easily known than the body
  - It would exist even if the body did not.

<!-- After this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth and certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I knew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the ground of this certitude. -->

"I think, therefore I am" has nothing which assures of their truth beyond this. 

<!-- , that I see very clearly that in order to think it is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take,  -->

As a general rule, all the things which we very clearly conceive are true. 

However, there is some difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we clearly conceive.

My being was not wholly perfect. So I thought <!--  (for I clearly saw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led to inquire whence I had learned to think --> of something more perfect than myself. 

I came up with the idea of God as perfection.

<!-- ; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some nature which in reality was more perfect. 

 As for the thoughts of many other objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat, and a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came; for since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them superior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were dependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain perfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing, that is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection of my nature.  -->

<!-- But this could not be the case with the idea of a nature more perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing manifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the more perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less perfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was equally impossible that I could hold it from myself= accordingly, it but remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in reality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself all the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in a single word, which was God.  -->

I knew some perfections which I lacked. It meant that:
- I was not the only being in existence. 
- there was logically some other more perfect Being whom I was dependent on, and from whom I had received all that I possessed.

If I had existed alone, and independently of every other being so as be perfect, then I would never be able to think of the words "infinite", "eternal", "immutable", "omniscient", "all-powerful" and all the other things that I was not. 

I therefore put all these perfections in God. 

<!-- 
however little, which I actually possessed, I should have been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole remainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus could of myself have become 

, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I could recognize in God.  -->

For in order to know the nature of God, I only had judge whether all the properties in my mind are perfect. 

<!-- I was assured that no one which indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest was awanting.  -->

Thus, I perceived that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, etc, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been happy to be free from them. 

Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and corporeal things. 

I might have been dreaming when I had them. 

They might be false. But they are still my thoughts. 

**But I had already very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature is distinct from the corporeal.**


## Conservation Laws by God

All composition is an evidence of dependency. Thus, a state of dependency is manifestly a state of imperfection.

I therefore determined that it could not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these 2 natures.
- Consequently, he was not so compounded.

Any bodies, intelligences, or other natures that were not totally perfect would have their existence depend on his power.

They could not subsist without him for a single moment.

I represented to myself the shapes of the geometers. I conceived them to be a continuous body or a space:
- indefinitely extended in length, width, and height or depth
- divisible into parts which admit of different figures and sizes
- capable of being moved or transposed in all manner of ways. 

These demonstrations lead to common consent, producing great certitude.

This consent is based on the fact that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules I have already laid down.

In the next place, I perceived that there was nothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the existence of their object.

Thus, I distinctly think of a triangle has its 3 angles being equal to 2 right angles. 
- But it does not mean that any triangle existed in reality. 

On the contrary, if my basis is the existence of the idea of 3 angles to 2 right angles, then it follows that the idea of a triangle exists.

If points that are equidistant from the center exists, then it follows that a sphere exists. 

I found existing things in my thoughts. If follows that a Perfect Being that has all these thoughts exists. 

Consequently, God, this Perfect Being, exists just as the shapes of geometry exist.

People have trouble realizing this because they never raise their thoughts above sensible objects. 

They are so used to consider only the ideas from material objects, that all that is not materially imaginable seems to them not intelligible. 

Philosophers of the schools accept as a maxim that:
- all our understanding comes from the senses 
- the ideas of God and of the soul have never been through our senses

Thus, those who perceive God and the soul through the material senses are like people who use their eyes to hear sounds or smell odours.


People who still doubt the existence of God and the soul should learn all my other propositions. 

God and the soul exist just as we have a body and just as the stars and the earth exist.

We have a strong moral assurance of these things. 

<!-- Yet at the same time no-one, unless his intellect is impaired, can deny, when the question relates to a metaphysical certitude, that there is sufficient reason to exclude entire assurance, in the observation that  -->


When we are asleep we might dream of:
- ourselves being in another body
- seeing other stars and another earth

This is even if those things to do not seem to exist.

 <!-- when there is nothing of the kind.  -->

How do we know that the thoughts in our dreams are false compared to our thoughts when awake?

 <!-- rather than those other which we experience when awake, since the former are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter?  -->

Genius men study this question as long as they want.

But they will be able to give any reason which can remove this doubt, unless they presuppose God's existence.

For, in the first place even the principle which I have already taken as a rule, viz., that 

My rule was that all the things which we clearly and distinctly conceive are true.

This rule is certain only because God:
- exists
- is a Perfect Being
- is the source of all that we possess

It follows that our ideas or notions, which to the extent of their clearness and distinctness are real, and proceed from God, must to that extent be true. 

We frequently have ideas or notions which have some falsity.
- Such ideas are therefore confused and obscure
- This obscurity comes from us not being totally perfect

<!-- , and in this proceed from nothing (participate of negation), that is, exist in us thus confused because we are not wholly perfect. -->

<!-- it is not less repugnant that falsity or imperfection, in so far as it is imperfection, should proceed from God, than that truth or perfection should proceed from nothing. 

But if we did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds from a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas might be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance that they possessed the perfection of being true. -->


The knowledge of God and of the soul makes us certain of this rule.

 <!-- we can easily understand that the truth of the thoughts we experience when awake, ought not in the slightest degree to be called in question on account of  -->

The illusions of our dreams does not affect the truth of our thoughts when we are awake.

 <!-- experience -->

A sleeping person might get a very distinct idea.

For example, a geometer might discover a new demonstration. His being asleep would not prevent its truth.

The error in our dreams make us question the truth in what we experience when awake, because we are also deceived in the same manner when awake.

<!-- ; and as for the most ordinary error of our dreams, which consists in their representing to us various objects in the same way as our external senses, this is not prejudicial, since it leads us very properly to suspect the truth of the ideas of sense;  -->

For example:
- persons with jaundice see all objects yellow
- we see the distant stars as very small

 <!-- or bodies at a great distance appear to us much smaller than they are.  -->

Whether awake or asleep, we should never be persuaded of the truth of anything unless on the evidence of our reason, and not of our imagination or of our senses.*

{{< n n="Here, Descartes refutes evidence from fantasy AND evidence from the raw physical senses. This is consistent with Socratic Dialectics which require all perceptions to be processed further instead of being taken raw" >}}


For example, we very clearly see the sun. But we should not conclude that it is as small as our eye sees it. 

 <!-- therefore to determine that it is only of the size which our sense of sight presents. -->

We can distinctly imagine the head of a lion joined to the body of a goat.

 <!-- without being therefore shut up to the conclusion that a chimaera exists; for it is not a dictate of -->

But it is not relevant to our reason whether the lion-goat really exists or not.

 <!-- what we thus see or imagine is in reality existent;  -->

Our reason simply tells us that all our ideas or notions have some truth in them.

Otherwise, God would not have placed them in us.

<!-- , who is wholly perfect and veracious, should have   -->

Our reasonings are clearer and most complete when we are awake, not when asleep. 

Sometimes, our imagination is more lively and distinct than our waking moments. 

<!-- Reason further dictates that, since  because of  -->

Our imperfection means that not all our thoughts can be true.

Those possessing truth are found in the experience of our waking moments rather than in that of our dreams.
