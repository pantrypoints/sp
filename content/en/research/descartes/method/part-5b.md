From the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to animals, particularly to man. 

<!-- But since I had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes, and by showing from what elements and in what manner nature must produce them, I remained satisfied with the supposition that  -->

God formed the body of man wholly like what we have. This includes:
- the external shape of the members 
- the internal conformation of the organs
- the same matter with that I had described

<!-- to one of ours, as well in  -->

At first, God placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle to replace the vegetative or sensitive soul.
- He merely kindled in the heart one of those lightless fires

This is not different from:
- the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry, or
- the heat which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit. 

At this point all the functions in the body do not need the power of thinking. Consequently, they are not from the soul.*

{{< n n="This is because Descartes wrongly defined thinking as the power of the human soul, different from the power of reacting which he assigns to the vegetative or sensitive soul. In Superphysics, the latter has only up to the 2 lower chakras active. But humans have the 3rd and 4th chakras active. This leads to the thinking action. The soul of plants, animals, are the same. It is just their physical vehicle has certain limitations which limit each soul" >}}

<!-- in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from the body, and of which it has been said above that the nature distinctively consists in thinking, functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us; 

but among which I could not discover any of those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong to us as men, while, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these as soon as I supposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which I described. -->


## How does the motion of the heart and arteries work? 

This is the first and most general motion observed in animals. 

<!-- , will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest.  -->

And that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about to say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy, before they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence 

Dissecting the heart of some large animal which has lungs will show its 2 ventricles or cavities. 

The right side has 2 very ample tubes:

1. The hollow vein (vena cava)

This is the principal receptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree of which all the other veins in the body are branches

2. The arterial vein (vena arteriosa) 

This is inappropriately named because it is only an artery which starts in the heart. It is divided outwards into many branches which presently disperse themselves all over the lungs. 

The left side cavity also has 2 canals equal in size to or larger than the preceding venous artery (arteria venosa) which is also inappropriately named because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided into many branches. 

It is interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and those of the tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe enters. 

The great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its branches all over the body. 

Such persons were carefully shown the 11 pellicles.
- Like other small valves, these open and shut the 4 orifices that are in these 2 cavities.


3 of these are at the entrance of the hollow veins.

These:
- do not prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart
- prevent that blood from flowing out

3 at the entrance to the arterial vein.
- These are arranged in an exactly opposite way of the former
- These permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity.

In like manner, 2 others at the mouth of the venous artery, which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart, but preclude its return.

3 at the mouth of the great artery cause the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its reflux. 

Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately closed with two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with 3. 

The grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture than the venous artery and the hollow vein.

The 2 last expand before entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself

There is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body.

This heat can cause any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate, just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel.

For, after these things, it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart, except that when its cavities are not full of blood, into these the blood of necessity flows, – from the hollow vein into the right, and from the venous artery into the left; because these two vessels are always full of blood, and their orifices, which are turned towards the heart, cannot then be closed. 

But as soon as two drops of blood have thus passed, one into each of the cavities, these drops which cannot but be very large, because the orifices through which they pass are wide, and the vessels from which they come full of blood, are immediately rarefied, and dilated by the heat they meet with. 

In this way they cause the whole heart to expand, and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances of the 2 vessels from which they flow, and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart, and becoming more and more rarefied, they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels, through which they pass out, causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract, as do also the arteries, because the blood that has entered them has cooled, and the six small valves close, and the five of the hollow vein and of the venous artery open anew and allow a passage to other two drops of blood, which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before.

The blood which enters into the heart passes through these two pouches called auricles. Their motion is the contrary of that of the heart. 

When the heart expands, they contract. 

This motion follows as necessarily from the very arrangement of the parts, which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone, and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers, and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience, as does the motion of a clock from the power, the situation, and shape of its counterweights and wheels.

Why is the blood in the veins, flowing in this way continually into the heart, not exhausted?

Why don't the arteries become too full, since all the blood which passes through the heart flows into them?

I need only mention in reply what has been written by a physician 1 of England, who has the honour of having broken the ice on this subject, and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries, through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins, whence it again returns to the heart; so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation. 

Of this we have abundant proof from surgeons. They tie the arm above the part where they open the vein. They cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature. The contrary would happen were they to bind it below between the hand and the opening, or were to make the ligature above the opening very tight. 

The tie, moderately straightened, can hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins. But it cannot prevent new blood from coming forward through the arteries because:
- these are situated below the veins
- their coverings, from their greater consistency, are more difficult to compress
- the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins. 

The latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins, there must of necessity be certain passages below the ligature, that is, towards the extremities of the arm through which it can come thither from the arteries. 

This physician likewise abundantly establishes what he has advanced respecting the motion of the blood, from the existence of certain pellicles, so disposed in various places along the course of the veins, in the manner of small valves, as not to permit the blood to pass from the middle of the body towards the extremities, but only to return from the extremities to the heart; 

From experience which shows that all the blood which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut, even although this had been closely tied in the immediate neighbourhood of the heart and cut between the heart and the ligature, so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart.

But there are many other circumstances which evince that what I have alleged is the true cause of the motion of the blood.

1. The difference between the blood which flows from the veins, and that from the arteries, can only arise from them being rarefied and distilled by passing through the heart.

This makes them thinner, more vivid, and warmer immediately after leaving the heart.

In other words, when in the arteries, than it was a short time before passing into either, in other words, when it was in the veins.

This difference is very marked only in the neighbourhood of the heart; and is not so evident in parts more remote from it. 

In the next place, the consistency of the coats of which the arterial vein and the great artery are composed, sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins. 

Why should the left cavity of the heart and the great artery be wider and larger than the right cavity and the arterial vein, were it not that the blood of the venous artery, having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart, is thinner, and rarefies more readily, and in a higher degree, than the blood which proceeds immediately from the hollow vein? 

What can physicians conjecture from feeling the pulse unless they know that according as the blood changes its nature it can be rarefied by the warmth of the heart, in a higher or lower degree, and more or less quickly than before? 

How is this heat communicated to the other members?

This is effected by the blood which passes through the heart to be heated there anew. From there, the heat is diffused over all the body.

If the blood is withdrawn from any part, the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means.

Even if the heart were as hot as glowing iron, it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands unless it continually sent there new blood.

We likewise perceive from this, that the true use of respiration is to bring sufficient fresh air into the lungs. This will cause the 

 <!-- rarefied -->
Blood flows into the lungs from the right ventricle of the heart where it has been decompressed and changed into vapors.

In the lungs this vaprized blood becomes thick and is converted anew into [oxygenized] blood.

It then flows into the left cavity to nourish the fire there.

<!-- This receives confirmation from the circumstance, that it is observed of  -->

Animals without lungs have but one cavity in the heart.

Babies while in the womb cannot use their lungs. They have:
- a hole through which the blood flows from the hollow vein into the left cavity of the heart
- a tube through which it passes from the arterial vein into the grand artery without passing through the lung. 

How could digestion be carried on in the stomach unless the heart communicated heat to it through the arteries?

Along with this are the more fluid parts of the blood which assist in dissolving the food.

 <!-- Is not also the operation which converts the juice of food into blood easily comprehended, when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than 100-200 times in a day?  -->

<!-- And what more need be adduced to explain nutrition, and the production of the different humours of the body, beyond saying,  -->

The force which rarefies the blood passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries. 

It causes its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive. There it occupies the place of some others expelled by them. 

According to the situation, shape, or smallness of the pores with which they meet, some rather than others flow into certain parts, in the same way that some sieves are observed to act, which, by being variously perforated, serve to separate different species of grain.
