Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise on all these matters. 

I was about to publish it when I learned that persons that I respect had condemned another physics work recently published. 
- That work had nothing prejudicial either to religion or to the state. 

<!-- , and nothing therefore which would have prevented me from giving expression to it in writing, if reason had persuaded me of its truth; -->

This led me to fear that my own doctrines might be interpreted to be against the truth, despite my great care in not offending anyone. 

<!--  I have always taken not to accord belief to new opinions of which I had not the most certain demonstrations, and not to give expression to aught that might tend to the hurt of any one.  -->

This has stopped me from publishing them. I have always disliked writing books. 

<!-- And these reasons, on one side and the other, are such that not only is it in some measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public, perhaps, to know them. -->

<!-- I have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind; and so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ beyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the speculative sciences, or endeavouring to regulate my actions according to the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish anything respecting it. For in what regards manners,  -->

<!-- Everyone is so full of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as heads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending them, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his people or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be prophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I believed that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more.  -->

As soon as I had learned [Aristotle's] physics and made experiments, I observed how limited it is and how much it differs from my principles. 

For the general good of mankind, I could not keep my principles concealed without sinning grievously against the current system of [Aristotle's] physics. 

<!-- the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as in us lies, the .  -->

My principles lead to:
- knowledge which is highly useful in life. 
- a practical way of knowing the force and action of fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies that surround us
  - This is in the same way that we distinctly know the crafts of our artisans.

This could make ourselves the lords and possessors of nature through the invention of an infinity of arts.

The first and fundamental use of such inventions is for the preservation of health.


<!-- For by them I perceived it to be possible to arrive at ; and in room of the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to discover a practical, by means of which, 

, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to which they are adapted, and thus -->

<!-- This is a result to be desired, not only in order to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be enabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all its comforts, but also and especially for 

, which is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, ; for -->

The mind is so intimately dependent on the condition and relation of the organs of the body.

 <!-- that if any means can ever be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I believe that it is in medicine they must be sought for.  -->

Medical science has a few useful things and is very decifient. 

<!--  whose utility is very remarkable= but without any wish to depreciate it, I am confident that there is no-one, even among those whose profession it is, who does not admit that all at present known in it is almost nothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; --> 

We could free ourselves from the maladies of body and mind, and perhaps also even old age, if we knew:
- their causes, and
- all the remedies provided by nature


I have dedicated my whole life in the search of such a science.

My path will inevitably reach success.

But it is hindered either by:
- the shortness of life or
- the want of experiments

<!-- , and since I had fallen in with a path which seems to me such, that if anyone follow it he must  the end desired, unless he be  -->

I can get around these obstacles by:
- communicating to the public all the little which I myself have found
- inciting men of superior genius to proceed farther than me, by contributing, each according to his inclination and ability, to the necessary experiments

 <!-- which it would be  to make, and also by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by the last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus -->

This would connect the lives and labours of many, so that we can collectively proceed much farther than if we worked individually.

 <!-- each by himself could do. -->


<!-- , I judged that there could be no more effectual provision against these two impediments than if I were faithfully to , and  -->


Experiments become always more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge. 

In the beginning, it is better to use only what is spontaneously presented to our senses. 

and of which we cannot remain ignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than to concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena= 

This is because the more uncommon often only misleads us so long as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown. 

The circumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and minute as to be highly difficult to detect. 

But in this I have adopted the following order:

1. I had written about the principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world

without taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself who has created it, and without educing them from any other source than from certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds.

2. I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects from these causes. 

I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth water, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which of all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to know. 

3. I descended to the more particular, so many diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to be impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of bodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might have been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently to apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their effects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments. 

Thereupon, turning over in my mind, the objects that had ever been presented to my senses I freely venture to state that I have never observed any which I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles had discovered. 

The power of nature is so ample and vast.

These principles are so simple and general.

I have hardly observed a single effect which I cannot immediately recognize as capable of being deduced in many different modes from the principles.

My greatest difficulty usually is figuring out in which of these modes the effect is dependent on them.

I can only get out of this difficulty by seeking experiments which have different results [between the control and the variable].

 <!-- same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain it, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other.  -->

<!-- As to what remains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient clearness what course must be taken to make the majority those experiments which may conduce to this end= but I perceive likewise that they are such and so numerous, -->


So many experiments are needed, that neither my hands nor my income, though it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be sufficient for them all.

The more experiments, the greater the progress in the knowledge of nature.

so that according as henceforward I shall have the means of making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same proportion make greater or less  

This was what I had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written, and so clearly to exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the public, as to induce all who have the common good of man at heart, that is, all who are virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or according to opinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they had already made, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.

But since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have been led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go on committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment, as soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same care upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish them. 

This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus afforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for doubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe will be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private use (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived it, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing), as because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the public, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings possess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death may be able to put them to what use they deem proper.

But I will not publish them during my lifetime because of the oppositions or controversies they will cause.

<!--  which they might give rise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would acquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had set apart for my own improvement. --> <!-- For though it be true that everyone is bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others, and that to be useful to no-one is really to be worthless, yet it is likewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it is good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the living, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will be of much greater advantage to posterity. -->

The little I have hitherto learned is almost nothing compared to that of which I am ignorant.

 <!-- and to the knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it is much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the sciences, as with  -->

This is similar to:
- those who when growing rich find less difficulty in making great acquisitions compared to when they were poor making acquisitions of much smaller amount.
- the commanders of armies, whose forces usually increase in proportion to their victories
  - They need greater prudence to keep together their troops after a defeat than after a victory

 <!-- to take towns and provinces.  For he truly engages in battle who   touching a matter of any generality and importance, and he requires thereafter  -->

A true warrior endeavours to surmount all the difficulties and errors which prevent him from reaching the knowledge of truth.

He loses if he admits a false opinion.
- He would need much more skill to recover his former position than to make great advances when once in possession of thoroughly ascertained principles. 

The truths that I have discovering in the sciences is from the 5-6 principal difficulties which I have surmounted.

<!-- , and my encounters with which I reckoned as battles in which victory declared for me. 

(and I trust that what is contained in this volume I will show that I have found some), I can declare that they are but the consequences and results of  -->

I will not hesitate even to avow my belief that nothing further is wanting to enable me fully to realize my designs than to gain 2-3 similar victories.

 <!-- far advanced in years but that, according to the ordinary course of nature, -->

I am not so old yet I may still have sufficient leisure for this end.

<!-- But I conceive myself the more bound to husband the time that remains the greater my expectation of being able to employ it aright, and I should doubtless have much to rob me of it, were I to publish the principles of my physics= for although they are almost all so evident that to assent to them no more is needed than simply to understand them -->

I can demonstrate all these principles. 

But they are against the the diverse opinions of others.

<!-- , and although there is not one of them of which I do not expect to be able to give demonstration, yet, as it is impossible that they can be in accordance with all 

, I foresee that I should frequently be turned aside from my grand design, on occasion of the opposition which they would be sure to awaken. -->

I expect opposition to them. But these oppositions would be useful in:
- making me aware of my errors
- making people realize the value of my philosophy
- allowing others to build on it

But though I recognize my extreme liability to error, and scarce ever trust to the first thoughts which occur to me, yet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views prevents me from anticipating any profit from them. 

For I have already had frequent proof of the judgments, as well of those I esteemed friends, as of some others to whom I thought I was an object of indifference, and even of some whose malignancy and envy would, I knew, determine them to endeavour to discover what partiality concealed from the eyes of my friends. 

But it has rarely happened that anything has been objected to me which I had myself altogether overlooked, unless it were something far removed from the subject= so that I have never met with a single critic of my opinions who did not appear to me either less rigorous or less equitable than myself.

And further, I have never observed that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the disputations that are practised in the schools; for while each strives for the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere verisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the question; and those who have been long good advocates are not afterwards on that account the better judges.

Other people would not get much advantage from me telling my thoughts. This is because these are mostly theoretical. <!--  I have not yet so far prosecuted them as that much does not remain to be added before they can be applied to practice. --> 

I am the best person to apply and implement these theories in the real world, because these are from me. I have noticed that other people have a different interpretation of my philosophy. 

<!-- If there is anyone who can carry them out that length, it must be myself rather than another= not that there may not be in the world many minds incomparably superior to mine, but because one cannot so well seize a thing and make it one’s own, when it has been learned from another, as when one has himself discovered it.  -->

<!-- And so true is this of the present subject that, though I have often explained some of my opinions to persons of much acuteness, who, whilst I was speaking, appeared to understand them very distinctly, yet, when they repeated them, I have observed that they almost always changed them to such an extent that I could no longer acknowledge them as mine.  -->

<!-- I am glad, by the way, to take this opportunity of requesting posterity never to believe on hearsay that anything has proceeded from me which has not been published by myself; and I am not at all astonished at the extravagances attributed to those ancient philosophers whose own writings we do not possess; whose thoughts, however, I do not on that account suppose to have been really absurd, seeing they were among the ablest men of their times, but only that these have been falsely represented to us.  -->

It is observable, accordingly, that scarcely in a single instance has any one of their disciples surpassed them; and I am quite sure that the most devoted of the present followers of Aristotle would think themselves happy if they had as much knowledge of nature as he possessed, were it even under the condition that they should never afterwards attain to higher. In this respect they are like the ivy which never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which frequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it seems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less wise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with knowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in addition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he says not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought. 

Their fashion of philosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities fall below mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and principles of which they make use enables them to speak of all things with as much confidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all that they say on any subject against the most subtle and skilful, without its being possible for any one to convict them of error. In this they seem to me to be like a blind man, who, in order to fight on equal terms with a person that sees, should have made him descend to the bottom of an intensely dark cave= and I may say that such persons have an interest in my refraining from publishing the principles of the philosophy of which I make use; for, since these are of a kind the simplest and most evident, I should, by publishing them, do much the same as if I were to throw open the windows, and allow the light of day to enter the cave into which the combatants had descended. But even superior men have no reason for any great anxiety to know these principles, for if what they desire is to be able to speak of all things, and to acquire a reputation for learning, they will gain their end more easily by remaining satisfied with the appearance of truth, which can be found without much difficulty in all sorts of matters, than by seeking the truth itself which unfolds itself but slowly and that only in some departments, while it obliges us, when we have to speak of others, freely to confess our ignorance. 

If, however, they prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of appearing ignorant of none, as such knowledge is undoubtedly much to be preferred, and, if they choose to follow a course similar to mine, they do not require for this that I should say anything more than I have already said in this discourse. For if they are capable of making greater advancement than I have made, they will much more be able of themselves to discover all that I believe myself to have found; since as I have never examined aught except in order, it is certain that what yet remains to be discovered is in itself more difficult and recondite, than that which I have already been enabled to find, and the gratification would be much less in learning it from me than in discovering it for themselves. Besides this, the habit which they will acquire, by seeking first what is easy, and then passing onward slowly and step by step to the more difficult, will benefit them more than all my instructions. Thus, in my own case, I am persuaded that if I had been taught from my youth all the truths of which I have since sought out demonstrations, and had thus learned them without labour, I should never, perhaps, have known any beyond these; at least, I should never have acquired the habit and the facility which I think I possess in always discovering new truths in proportion as I give myself to the search. And, in a single word, if there is any work in the world which cannot be so well finished by another as by him who has commenced it, it is that at which I labour.

It is true, indeed, as regards the experiments which may conduce to this end, that one man is not equal to the task of making them all; but yet he can advantageously avail himself, in this work, of no hands besides his own, unless those of artisans, or parties of the same kind, whom he could pay, and whom the hope of gain (a means of great efficacy) might stimulate to accuracy in the performance of what was prescribed to them. For as to those who, through curiosity or a desire of learning, of their own accord, perhaps, offer him their services, besides that in general their promises exceed their performance, and that they sketch out fine designs of which not one is ever realized, they will, without doubt, expect to be compensated for their trouble by the explication of some difficulties, or, at least, by compliments and useless speeches, in which he cannot spend any portion of his time without loss to himself. 

And as for the experiments that others have already made, even although these parties should be willing of themselves to communicate them to him (which is what those who esteem them secrets will never do), the experiments are, for the most part, accompanied with so many circumstances and superfluous elements, as to make it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the truth from its adjuncts- besides, he will find almost all of them so ill described, or even so false (because those who made them have wished to see in them only such facts as they deemed conformable to their principles), that, if in the entire number there should be some of a nature suited to his purpose, still their value could not compensate for the time what would be necessary to make the selection. 

So that if there existed any one whom we assuredly knew to be capable of making discoveries of the highest kind, and of the greatest possible utility to the public; and if all other men were therefore eager by all means to assist him in successfully prosecuting his designs, I do not see that they could do aught else for him beyond contributing to defray the expenses of the experiments that might be necessary; and for the rest, prevent his being deprived of his leisure by the unseasonable interruptions of any one. 

But besides that I neither have so high an opinion of myself as to be willing to make promise of anything extraordinary, nor feed on imaginations so vain as to fancy that the public must be much interested in my designs; I do not, on the other hand, own a soul so mean as to be capable of accepting from any one a favour of which it could be supposed that I was unworthy.

These considerations taken together were the reason why, for the last three years, I have been unwilling to publish the treatise I had on hand, and why I even resolved to give publicity during my life to no other that was so general, or by which the principles of my physics might be understood. But since then, two other reasons have come into operation that have determined me here to subjoin some particular specimens, and give the public some account of my doings and designs.

Of these considerations, the first is, that if I failed to do so, many who were cognizant of my previous intention to publish some writings, might have imagined that the reasons which induced me to refrain from so doing, were less to my credit than they really are; for although I am not immoderately desirous of glory, or even, if I may venture so to say, although I am averse from it in so far as I deem it hostile to repose which I hold in greater account than aught else, yet, at the same time, I have never sought to conceal my actions as if they were crimes, nor made use of many precautions that I might remain unknown; and this partly because I should have thought such a course of conduct a wrong against myself, and partly because it would have occasioned me some sort of uneasiness which would again have been contrary to the perfect mental tranquillity which I court. 

And forasmuch as, while thus indifferent to the thought alike of fame or of forgetfulness, I have yet been unable to prevent myself from acquiring some sort of reputation, I have thought it incumbent on me to do my best to save myself at least from being ill-spoken of. The other reason that has determined me to commit to writing these specimens of philosophy is, that I am becoming daily more and more alive to the delay which my design of self-instruction suffers, for want of the infinity of experiments I require, and which it is impossible for me to make without the assistance of others= and, without flattering myself so much as to expect the public to take a large share in my interests, I am yet unwilling to be found so far wanting in the duty I owe to myself, as to give occasion to those who shall survive me to make it matter of reproach against me some day, that I might have left them many things in a much more perfect state than I have done, had I not too much neglected to make them aware of the ways in which they could have promoted the accomplishment of my designs.

And I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which should neither be obnoxious to much controversy, nor should compel me to expound more of my principles than I desired, and which should yet be sufficient clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the sciences. 

Whether or not I have succeeded in this it is not for me to say; and I do not wish to forestall the judgments of others by speaking myself of my writings; but it will gratify me if they be examined, and, to afford the greater inducement to this I request all who may have any objections to make to them, to take the trouble of forwarding these to my publisher, who will give me notice of them, that I may endeavour to subjoin at the same time my reply; and in this way readers seeing both at once will more easily determine where the truth lies; for I do not engage in any case to make prolix replies, but only with perfect frankness to avow my errors if I am convinced of them, or if I cannot perceive them, simply to state what I think is required for defence of the matters I have written, adding thereto no explication of any new matte that it may not be necessary to pass without end from one thing to another.

If some of the matters of which I have spoken in the beginning of the “Dioptrics” and “Meteorics” should offend at first sight, because I call them hypotheses and seem indifferent about giving proof of them, I request a patient and attentive reading of the whole, from which I hope those hesitating will derive satisfaction; for it appears to me that the reasonings are so mutually connected in these treatises, that, as the last are demonstrated by the first which are their causes, the first are in their turn demonstrated by the last which are their effects. 

Nor must it be imagined that I here commit the fallacy which the logicians call a circle; for since experience renders the majority of these effects most certain, the causes from which I deduce them do not serve so much to establish their reality as to explain their existence; but on the contrary, the reality of the causes is established by the reality of the effects. 

Nor have I called them hypotheses with any other end in view except that it may be known that I think I am able to deduce them from those first truths which I have already expounded; and yet that I have expressly determined not to do so, to prevent a certain class of minds from thence taking occasion to build some extravagant philosophy upon what they may take to be my principles, and my being blamed for it. 

Some people imagine that they can master in 1 day all that another has taken 20 years to think out, as soon as he has spoken 2-3 words to them on the subject.

<!-- ; or who are the more liable to error and the less capable of perceiving truth in very proportion as they are more subtle and lively. As to the opinions which are truly and wholly mine, I offer no apology for them as new, – persuaded as I am that if their reasons be well considered they will be found to be so simple and so conformed, to common sense as to appear less extraordinary and less paradoxical than any others which can be held on the same subjects; nor do I even boast of being the earliest discoverer of any of them, but only of having adopted them, neither because they had nor because they had not been held by others, but solely because reason has convinced me of their truth. -->

Artisans might not be able to immediately execute the invention explained in the “Dioptrics”. This is because address and practice are required to make and adjust the machines precisely as I described.

<!-- I do not think that any one on that account is entitled to condemn it; for since  -->

   <!-- I should not be less astonished if they succeeded on the first attempt than if a person were in one day to become an accomplished performer on the guitar, by merely having excellent sheets of music set up before him.  -->

I write in French instead of Latin because I expect the people with unprejudiced natural reason to be better judges of my opinions.

 <!-- than those who give heed to the writings of the ancients only; and as for those who unite good sense with habits of study, whom alone I desire for judges, they will not, I feel assured, be so partial to Latin as to refuse to listen to my reasonings merely because I expound them in the vulgar tongue. -->

In conclusion, I am unwilling here to say anything very specific of the progress which I expect to make for the future in the sciences, or to bind myself to the public by any promise which I am not certain of being able to fulfil; 

I have resolved to devote my life to acquiring some knowledge of Nature that can enable us to deduce rules in medicine of greater certainty than those at present in use.

<!-- ; and that my inclination is so much opposed to all other pursuits, especially to such as cannot be useful to some without being hurtful to others, that if, by any circumstances, I had been constrained to engage in such, I do not believe that I should have been able to succeed.  -->

<!-- Of this I here make a public declaration, though well aware that it cannot serve to procure for me any consideration in the world, which, however, I do not in the least affect;  -->

I shall always hold myself more obliged to those through whose favour I am permitted to enjoy my retirement without interruption than to any who might offer me the highest earthly preferments.
