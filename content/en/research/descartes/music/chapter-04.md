This may be considered chiefly in three manners, or ways; either in sounds which are emitted at once and together from divers bodies; or in those which are emitted successively from the same voice.

Or lastly, in those which are emitted successively from divers voices, or sonorous bodies. From the first manner, arise Consonancies: from the second, Degrees: from the third, Dissonancies, which come nearer to Consonancies. 

Where it is manifest that in Consonancies the Diversity of Sounds ought to be less, than in Degrees; because that would more tire, and disgust the Hearing.
