A ball is pushed from `A` to `B`.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/tennis2.jpg" alt="Tennis Refraction" >}}


It encounters at `B` not the surface of the Earth, but a thin and delicate fabric `CBE`. It is so weak that the ball can break through and pass through it, only losing half its speed.

What path will it take?

Its motion differs entirely from its determination to move towards one side rather than the other.

Therefore, their quantities must be examined separately. 

Two force make up the movement of the ball:
- The horizontal
- The vertical 

Of these two, only the vertical force can be altered by the encounter with the fabric.

<!-- Out of the two comp`onents that can be imagined for this determination, only the one that made the ball tends upwards and downwards   -->

The vertical force remains unchanged because the fabric does not oppose it in that direction.

<!-- As for the component that made it tend towards the right hand, it must  -->

Circle `AFD` has its center at `B`. It has 3 straight lines `AC`, `HB`, `FE` perpendicular to `CBE`.
- The distance between `AC` and `HB` is half as that between `HB` and `FE`. 

We will see that the ball must tend towards point `I`. 

This is because it loses half its speed in crossing the canvas `CBE`. And so it must take twice as long to pass below, from `B` to some point on the circumference of the circle `AFD`, as it took it to come from `A` to `B` above.
- It does not change its rightward motion.

And so in twice the time it took to pass from the line `AC` to `HB`, it must make twice as much progress towards that same side. 

Consequently, it would arrive at some point on the straight line `FE`, at the same instant that it also arrives at some point on the circumference of the circle `AFD`. 

It must go to `I` since that is the only point below the canvas `CBE` where the circle `AFD` and the straight line `FE` intersect.


Let us now imagine that the ball, coming from `A` towards `D`, meets at point `B` water. Its surface `CBE` takes away exactly half of its speed, just as that canvas did.

This ball must pass from `B` in a straight line, towards `I`. 

This is because the water's surface must turn it towards there in the same way as the canvas, since it takes away just as much of its force, and is opposed to it in the same direction.

The rest of the water that fills the space from `B` to `I` resists it more than the air. 

<!-- But the water can also move from one side or the other.  -->

 <!-- we previously assumed, that does not mean it should deviate it more or less: for it can open up to let it pass just as easily towards one side as towards the other, at least if we always assume, as we do, that neither the weight or lightness of this ball, nor its size, nor its shape, nor any other such foreign cause changes its course. -->


Since it loses half of its velocity while crossing the fabric `CBE`, it must take twice as much time to pass below from B to some point on the circumference of the circle `AFD` as it took to come from `A` to `B` above.


It does not lose any of the determination. And so it must:
- advance towards the right side, in twice the amount of time it took to pass from line `AC` to `HB`
- cover twice the distance towards the same side

Consequently, it would reach some point on the straight line `FE` when it also reaches some point on the circumference of the circle `AFD`. 

This would be impossible if it did not go towards `I`, given that it is the only point below the fabric `CBE` where the circle `AFD` and the straight line `FF` intersect.


<!-- And since it loses nothing of its determination to advance towards the right side, in twice as much time as it took to pass from the line AC to HB, it must cover twice as much distance towards the same side, and consequently reach some point on the line FE at the same instant that it reaches some point on the circumference of the circle AFD. This would be impossible if it did not go towards I, since it is the only point below the net CBE where the circle AFD and the line FF intersect. -->

<!-- Let us now come to Refraction. And first let us suppose that a ball, driven from A towards B, meets at point B, no longer the surface of the earth, but a web CBE, which is so weak and thin that this ball has the strength to break it and pass right through, losing only a part of its velocity, namely, for example, half. Now this being supposed, in order to know what path it must follow, let us consider again that its movement differs entirely from its determination to move towards one side rather than the other, from which it follows that their quantity must be examined separately. -->

<!-- Why the angle of reflection is equal to that of incidence.
By how much the movement of a ball is deflected when it passes through a canvas. -->


<!-- Let us also consider that, of the two parts that can be imagined to compose this determination, only the one that made the ball tend from top to bottom can be changed in some way by the encounter with the net; and that, for the one that made it tend towards the right hand, it must always remain the same as it was, because the net does not oppose it in that sense. Then, having described the center B of the circle AFD, and drawn perpendicular lines AC, HB, FE from B, so that there are twice as many distance between FE and HB as between HB and AC, we will see that the ball must tend towards the point I. For, since it loses half of its speed when crossing the net CBE, it must take twice as much time to pass below, from B to some point on the circumference of the circle AFD, as it took above to come from A to B.

<!-- Let us now consider the case where the ball, which comes from A towards D, encounters at point 13, not a net, but water, whose surface CBE takes away exactly half of its speed, just like the net did. And assuming the rest is the same as before, I say that this ball must pass from B in a straight line, not towards D, but towards I. For firstly, it is certain that the surface of the water must deflect it towards there in the same way as the net, since it takes away just as much of its force and is opposed to it in the same direction. And secondly, for the rest of the water that fills the space from B to I, even though it may resist the ball more or less than the air we previously supposed, it does not follow that it must deflect it more or less: for it can open up to let it pass just as easily in one direction as in another, at least if we continue to assume, as we do, that neither the weight or lightness of the ball, nor its size, nor its shape, nor any other such external cause changes its course.

The ball is deflected all the more by the surface of the water or the net, the more obliquely it encounters it.

If it encounters it at a right angle, as when it is pushed from `H` to `B`, it must pass straight through in a line towards `G`, without deviating at all. 

But if it is pushed along a line like `AB`, which is so inclined with respect to the surface of the water or the net `CBE`, that the line `FE`, being drawn as before, does not cut across the circle `AD`, this ball would not penetrate it at all.

Instead, it would bounce back from its surface `B` into the air `L`, just as if it had encountered earth.

This actually happened when artillery was fired towards the bottom of a river for entertainment.
- Those on the opposite bank were injured.
