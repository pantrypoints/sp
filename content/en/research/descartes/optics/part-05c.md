The eye has defects. It is unable to focus the incoming rays at a precise point. 

<!-- However, after speaking to you about the perfections of this painting, it is also necessary for me to point out its defects, of which the first and principal one is that,  -->

<!-- No matter what shape the parts of the eye may have, it is impossible for them to make the rays coming from different points assemble in as many other different points. -->

The best it can do is to simply gather all the rays coming from a single point, such as `X`, in another point, such as `S`, in the middle of the back of the eye.

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/eye.jpg" a="Eye" >}}

Only a few of the rays:
- from point `V` assemble exactly at point `R`
- from point `Y` assemble exactly at point `T`

The others must deviate somewhat from these points.

<!-- , all around, as I will explain later.  -->

This is why:
- this painting is never as clear at its extremities as it is in the middle
- vision occurs mainly along a straight line

<!-- , as has been sufficiently observed by those who have written about optics. XKLS-->

This line passes through the centers of the crystalline humor and the pupil, such as the line `XK2S`, which is called the axis of vision.

The rays coming from point `V` deviate around point `R`.
- They deviate more if the opening of the pupil is larger.

The larger pupil will make the colors of this painting stronger and more vivid.
- But it also prevents the shapes in the painting from being as distinct.
- This is why it can only be mediocre.

These rays would deviate even more around point `R` if `V` were:
- much closer to the eye at `10`, or 
- much farther away at `11`

<!-- than `X`
 at the distance at which I suppose the figure of the eye is proportional. -->

If `V` is the ideal distance to the eye, those new locations would make the painting less distinct.

<!-- This would make In this way, they would make the part `R` of this  -->

<!-- And you will easily understand the demonstrations of all this when you have seen, below, what figure -->

Transparent bodies invert the images that pass through them as they make the rays coming from a single point assemble in some other point. 

<!--  after passing through them. 

This painting is inverted. -->

 <!-- that is, in a position entirely opposite to that of the objects; and in the fact that they are foreshortened and abbreviated, some more, some less, according to the diverse distance and situation of the things they represent, almost in the same way as in a perspective tableau. -->

- `T` on the left represents `Y` which is on the right.
- `R` on the right represents `V` which is on the left.

At point `R`, object `V` should not be:
- larger than object `10` even if object `10` is smaller but closer
- smaller than object `11` even if object `11` is larger but farther away, though object `V` would be a little more distinct

<!-- than the shape the object `10`, which is smaller but closer, nor less space than the shape of the  -->

The straight line `VXY` is represented by the curve `RST`.

<!-- Now, having thus seen this painting in the eye of a dead animal, and having considered the reasons for it, one cannot doubt that a similar painting is formed in the eye of a living man, on the inner surface of the eye, in the place where we had substituted the white body RST. -->

<!-- We see 
and indeed, it is formed much better there, because -->
