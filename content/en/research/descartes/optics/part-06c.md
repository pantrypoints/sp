The eye's shape must be a little different to make us see what is close to our eyes, than to make us see what is further away.

We change it to proportion it to the distance of the objects.

In doing so, we also change a certain part of our brain so that our soul can perceive this distance without us reflecting on it. 

This is similar to how we grasp something with our hand and conform our hand to the size and shape of that thing. 
- We feel it through our hand, without needing to think about its movements. 


We know secondly the distance by the relationship between the two eyes. 


The blind man holding the 2 sticks `AE`, `CE`.

He ignores their length `I`. 

He knows only:
- the distance between his hands `A` and `C`
- the size of the angles `ACE`, `CAE`

From these, as by a natural geometry, he can know where point `E` is.

So, when our two eyes `RST` and `rst` are turned towards `X`, the size of the line `Ss`, and that of the two angles `XSs` and `XsS` make us know where the point `X` is.

We can also do the same with the help of a single eye by making it change place.
- We look with both eyes at `X`
- We then close the left eye and see it through point `S`
- Then we immediately close the right eye and open the left at point `s`

This will make the size of the line `Ss` and the 2 angles `XSs` and `XsS` come together in our imagination so that we can perceive the distance of point `X`. 

<!-- This by an action of thought, which, being only a simple imagination, does not fail to involve a reasoning similar to that which the  -->

- This is similar to how surveyors use 2 different stations to measure inaccessible places. 

Another way of perceiving distance is by comparing at the same time: 
- the distinctness or confusion of the shape
- the strength or weakness of the light. 

While we stare at `X`, the rays coming from the objects `10` and `12` do not come together so exactly towards `R` and `T` at the bottom of our eye. 

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/eye.jpg" a="Eye" >}}

This is as if these objects were at the points `V` and `Y`. From there, we see that they are further away, or closer to us, than `X`.

The light from object `10` going into our eye is stronger than if that object were towards `V`.
- So we judge it to be closer.

The light coming from the object `12` is weaker than if it were towards `Y`.
- So we judge it to be farther.


Finally, we can estimate the distance of objects from:
- their size
- their location
- the distinctness of their figure and colours
<!-- - , or only the strength of the light coming from it, this can serve us, not properly to see, but to imagine its distance. -->

When we look from afar at a body that we are used to see up close, we judge its distance much better than something that we have never seen.

 <!-- we would if its size were less known to us.  -->

<!-- Looking at a mountain exposed to the sun, beyond a forest covered in shadow, it is only the situation of that forest that makes us judge it the closest.

Of 2 ships, we can judge which one is the farthest  
Looking at two ships on the sea, one of which is smaller than the other, but closer in proportion, so that they appear equal, we will be able by the difference in their figures, and their colours, and the light they send towards us, to judge which .
