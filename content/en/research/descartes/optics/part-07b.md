To remedy these defects, we should seek a piece of glass or some transparent body which have  surfaces that can bend the rays which fall on it so that the light can be diverted, by crossing them, into the eye.

 <!-- just as if they had come from another point which was nearer or more distant, namely, which was nearer to serve those who are short-sighted, and which was further away both for old people and generally for all those who want to see objects closer than the shape of their eyes allows. -->

For, for example, the eye `B` or `C`[28] caused the rays which come from the point `H` or `I` to 
assemble in the middle of its back.

and, not being able to, to also cause those of point V or X to assemble there; 

If we put in front of it the glass `O` or `P`, which causes all the rays from the point `V` or `X` to enter inside just the same as if they came from the point `H` or `I`, we will compensate by this average to its defect.

There may be glasses of different shapes which can have this same effect. There are 2 conditions in choosing the best glass:

1. These shapes should be the simplest and easiest to draw and carve as possible.

2. The rays which come from other points of the object, like `EE`, should enter the eye almost as if they came from as many other points, like `FF`

I say here approximately, not as much as possible. This is because it would be difficult to determine by geometry, among an infinity of shapes, which can serve for this purpose.

Those which are the most suitable for it would be useless because the eye even if they do not cause all the rays which come from various points to assemble precisely 

at as many other various points, they would doubtless not therefore be the most suitable for making the vision quite distinct.

It is impossible in this to choose otherwise than approximately, because the precise shape of the eye is unknown to us. 

Moreover, we will always have to take care, 

When we apply some body before our eyes, we should imitate nature as far as possible in all the things that we see.

In this way, we lose none of the advantages Nature has given us and gain some important ones.

The size of the images depends only on 3 things:

1. The distance between the object and the bottom of the eye where they rays it sends intersect.

 <!-- place where the rays which it sends from various of its points towards the ,  -->

2. What is between this same place and the fundus of the eye

3. The refraction of these rays.



The image `RST`[29] would be larger than it is if the object `VXY` were closer to the place `K` where the rays `VKR` and `YKT` intersect, or rather to the area `BCD` which is properly the place where they begin to cross, as you will see below.

{{< img src="/graphics/bio/eye.jpg" alt="Eyeballs" >}}

Or, if we could make the body of the eye longer, so that there would be more distance than there is. 

There is from its surface `BCD`, which causes these rays to intersect, to the bottom `RST`.

If the refraction did not bend them so much inwards towards the middle `S`, but rather outwards.

Besides these 3 things, nothing else can make that picture bigger. Even the last is hardly considerable because one can only increase the image very little by this means.

<!-- , and this with so much difficulty that one can always do it more easily by one. others, so you will know everything now. -->

So we see that nature has neglected it. Nature caused the rays, like `VKR` and `YKT`, to curve inwards towards `S` on the surfaces `BCD` and `123`. 

It made the `RST` image a little smaller than if it had made them curve outwards, as they are around `5` on the area `456`, or she would have let them be straight. 

There is also no need to consider the first of these three things when these objects are not at all accessible.

But, when they are, the more closely we look at them, the larger their images are formed in the depths of our eyes.
