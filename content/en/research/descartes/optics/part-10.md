After choosing the glass or crystal that you intend to use, find the proportion, which serves as a measure for its refractions.

This can be conveniently found with the help of such an instrument. 


`EFI` is a completely flat and straight board or ruler made of a not too shiny nor transparent material. The light striking it should be easily distinguished from the shadow. 

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/fig_48-d.jpg" a="Device" >}}

`EA` and `FL` are 2 small blades that are not transparent. These are raised perpendicular to `EFI`. 

It has 2 small round holes, `A` and `L`, placed exactly opposite each other. 

The ray `AL` passes through is parallel to the line `EF`.

Then `RPQ` is a piece of the glass you wish to test. Cut in into a triangle, of which:
- the angle `RQP` is right
- `PRQ` is more acute than `RPQ`. 

The 3 sides `RQ, QP`, and `RP` are 3 completely flat and polished faces. 

The face `QP` is pressed against the board `EFI`, and the other face `QR` against the blade `FL`.

The sun's ray passes through the two holes `A` and `L` penetrating as far as `B` through the glass `PQR` without suffering any refraction. This is because it meets its surface `RQ` perpendicularly. 

But having reached the point `B` where it meets its other surface `RP` obliquely, it cannot emerge without bending towards some point on the board `EF`, as for example towards `I`.

This instrument makes the sun's ray pass through these holes `A` and `L`, in order to know the ratio that the point `I` (the center of the small oval of light that this ray describes on the board `EFI`) has with the 2 other points `B` and `P`.

- `B` is the one where the straight line passing through the centers of the two holes `A` and `L` terminates on the surface RP;
- `P` is the one where this surface `RP` and that of the board `EFI` are cut, by the plane that is imagined to pass through the points B and I, and also through the centers of the two holes A and L.


Transfer the triangle `BPI` with a compass onto paper. 

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/fig_49-d.jpg" a="Angles" >}}

From the center `B`, draw the circle `NPT` through the point `P`. Having taken the arc `NP` equal to `PT`, draw the straight line `BN` which cuts `IP` extended at the point `H`.

Then again from the center `B` through `H`, draw the circle `HO` which cuts `BI` at the point `O`.

You now have the proportion between the lines `HI` and `OI` as the common measure of all the refractions that can be caused by the difference between the air and the glass you are examining.

<!-- If you are not yet sure of this, you can have other small right-angled triangles of the same glass made, and using them in the same way to find this proportion, you will always find it to be the same, and thus you will have no reason to doubt that it is truly the one you were looking for.  -->

If after that, on the straight line `HI`, you take `MI` equal to `OI`, and `HD` equal to `DM`, you will have `D` for the summit, and `H` and `I` for the burning points of the hyperbola.

 <!-- that this glass must have the figure of to serve for the lenses I have described. -->

You can make these 3 points `HDI` more or less distant than they are, simply by drawing another straight line parallel to `HI` farther or closer to the point `B`. Drawing 3 straight lines `BH`, `BD`, `BI` from this point B that cut it. 

There is the same ratio between the three points HDI and hdi, as between the three `HDI`.

Having these 3 points, you can trace the hyperbola by planting 2 pegs at the points `H` and `I`, and making the cord placed around the peg `H` be so attached to the ruler that it cannot fold back towards `I`, farther than up to `D`.


If you prefer to trace it with the ordinary compass by finding several points through which it passes; place one of the points of this compass at point `H`.

Open it so that its other point passes a little beyond point `D`, as far as `I`, from the center `H`.

Draw the circle `I33`. Then make `M2` equal to `HI` from the center `I` through point `2`.

Draw the circle `233` which cuts the previous one at the points `33`, through which this hyperbola must pass, as well as through the point D, which is its summit.

Then put the point of the compass back at the point `H`. Open it so that its other point passes a little beyond the point `I`, as far as `4`. From the center `H` draw the circle `466`. 

Take `M5` as equal to `H4` from the center `I` through `5`. Then draw the circle `566` which cuts the previous one at the points `66` which are in the hyperbola.

Continue to place the compass point at point `H`. The rest as before, you can find as many points as you please of this hyperbola.

This may not be bad for roughly making some model that roughly represents the shape of the lenses to be cut. 

But to give them this figure exactly, it is necessary to have some other invention by means of which one can describe hyperbolas in one stroke, as one describes circles with a compass. 

First, from the center `T`, which is the middle of the line `HI`, draw the circle `HVI`.

Then from the point `D` raise a perpendicular on `HI` which cuts this circle at the point `V`.

Draw a straight line from `T` through this point `V`. You will get the angle `HTV`.

Imagine it rotating around the axis `HT` so that the line `TV` will draw the surface of a Cone.

On that surface, the section made by the plane `VX` parallel to this axis HT, and on which `DV` falls at right angles, will be a hyperbola exactly similar and equal to the previous one.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/fig_52.jpg" a="Angles" >}}


All the other planes parallel to this one will also cut in this Cone hyperbolas all similarly but unequally.

They will have their foci more or less distant according as these planes are distant from this axis.

After which one can make such a machine.
