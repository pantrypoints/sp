### 13. The Action of External Objects Can Diversely Direct the Spirits to the Muscles 

*Dioptrique* explained how all the objects of sight are communicated to us.

<!-- move locally -->
- The object's light hits the intermediary of transparent bodies in our eyes. 
- This moves the small threads of the optic nerves at the back of our eyes.
- This moves the parts of the brain, attached to these nerves, in many different ways to make us see diversities in things.

It is the movements in the brain that represent these objects to the soul. 

 <!-- not immediately the movements in the eye, but those in the brain,  -->

This is how we conceive sounds, odors, flavors, heat, pain, hunger, thirst, and generally all objects of our:
- external senses
- internal appetites

Our senses and appetites excite some movement in our nerves which passes through them to the brain.

These various movements of the brain make our soul have various sensations.

But they can also, without the soul, cause the spirits to go into the muscles and move our limbs. 
- If our friend raises his hand toward our eyes as if to strike us, we still struggle to prevent our eyes from closing even if we know he will not harm us.
- This shows that our eyes close not through the intermediary of our soul, since the closing of our eyes is against our will.
 <!-- which is its only or at least its main action. -->

<!-- But because the machine of our body is so composed that the movement of  -->

The action of his hand towards our eyes excites another movement in our brain which directs the animal spirits into the muscles that lower the eyelids.


### 14. How the Diversity Among the Spirits Can Also Vary Their Course

<!-- The other cause that serves to differently direct  -->

The animal spirits enter into the muscles in different ways due to:
- the unequal agitation of these spirits
- the diversity of their parts. 

When some of their parts are larger and more agitated than others, they pass further in a straight line through the cavities and pores of the brain, and in this way are directed to different muscles than they would be if they had less force.


### 15. What Causes Their Diversity

This inequality can come from the various materials they are composed of. 

An example is those who have drunk a lot of wine.

The vapors of this wine quickly enter the blood and rise from the heart into the brain where they convert into spirits.

- This moves the body in several strange ways.
 <!-- which being stronger and more abundant than usual, are capable of moving the -->

This inequality of the spirits can also come from the organs that produce them: 
- the heart
- the liver
- the stomach
- the spleen, etc

<!--  various conditions ofand all other parts that contribute to their production. -->

Small nerves at the base of the heart widens and narrows the entrances of its cavities.
- This creates dilated blood that produces spirits that are differently disposed

 <!-- dilating more or less strongly produces .  -->

The blood that enters the heart comes from all other parts of the body.

These are pushed there by the nerves and organs.
- This creates animal spirits of different qualities. 

<!-- , it often happens that it is pushed there more from some parts than others, because the nerves and muscles that correspond to those parts press or agitate it more. -->

<!-- According to the diversity of the parts from which it comes the most, it dilates differently in the heart and subsequently produces spirits with different qualities. -->

<!-- The lower part of the liver is where the bile is. -->

For example, the blood that comes from the liver dilates differently in the heart than:
- the blood that comes from the spleen, and
- the blood that comes from the veins of the arms or legs
- the blood that has just left the liver from the intestines

<!-- This blood is also different from the juice of the food after it . -->

 <!-- and quickly passes through the liver to the heart. -->


### 16. How All Members Can Be Moved by the Objects of the Senses and by the Spirits Without the Help of the Soul

The changes in the movement of the spirits can create a corresponding change in the pores of the brain.

 <!-- cause them to open some pores more than others-->

Likewise, our sensory nerves can also open and affect the movement of the spirits.
- This makes those spirits go into the muscles [to facilitate instinctive reactions].

 <!-- that serve to move the body, in the way it is ordinarily moved on the occasion of such an action. -->

<!-- Conversely, when any of these pores is more or less open than usual, by the action of the nerves that serve the senses, it changes something in the  and causes them to be directed  -->

The following actions we do without our will contributing to it:
- breathe, walk, eat
- all the actions we share with animals

These actions depend only on the agreement between:
- our body parts
- the flow of the animal spirits

 <!-- the conformation of our members and the course that the spirits, excited by the heat of the heart, naturally follow in the brain, nerves, and muscles.  -->

This is similar to how a clock's movement is produced solely by:
- the shape of its wheels
- the force of its spring
