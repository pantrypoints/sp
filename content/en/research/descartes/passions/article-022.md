### 22. The Difference Between Various Perceptions

There are perceptions that come to the soul through the nerves.

- Some of these we attribute to external objects that strike our senses
- Others we attribute to our body
- Others we attribute to our soul

<!--  I have not yet explained and there is this difference between them: some  or to some of its parts, and finally others to our soul. -->


### 23. Perceptions We Attribute to External Objects

External objects strike our senses which then excite movements in the brain through the nerves.
- This is then felt by our soul. 

<!-- Those that we attribute to things outside of us, namely to the objects of our senses, are caused (at least when our opinion is not false) by these objects, which, exciting some movements in the organs of the external senses, also excite -->

For example, we:
- see the light of a torch
- hear the sound of a bell

This sound and light are 2 different actions which excite 2 different movements in some of our nerves in the brain.

This gives our soul 2 different feelings.

This makes us think that we see the torch itself and hear the bell, not just feel the movements that come from them.

 <!-- which we relate so much to the subjects we suppose to be their causes, that we  -->


### 24. Internal and External Bodily Perceptions

<!-- Perceptions We Attribute to Our Body:  -->

Examples of bodily perceptions are:
- hunger, thirst, and our other natural appetites
- pain, heat, and other affections we feel as in our members

<!-- we attribute to our body or some of its parts are those we have of  -->

 <!-- and not as in objects outside of us.  -->

<!-- Thus, we can feel at the same time, and  -->

Through the same nerves, we can feel:
- the coldness of our hand
  - We can perceive that this is in us. 
- the heat of the flame
  - We can perceive that this is outside of us. 
<!-- conversely the heat of the hand and the cold of the air it is exposed to.  -->


 <!-- the coldness of our hand -->

<!-- There is no difference between the actions that make us feel the heat or cold that is in our hand and those that make us feel the one that is outside of us, except that one of these actions occurring with the other, we judge that the first is already in us and that the one that follows is not yet in us but in the object causing it. -->


### 25. Soul-Perceptions

 <!-- We Attribute to Our  -->

<!-- The perceptions that are attributed only to the soul are those whose effects  -->

These are felt as within the soul itself and have no other cause. 

 <!-- for which no proximate cause is commonly known to which they can be attributed. -->

Examples are feelings of joy, anger, and similar emotions.

These are sometimes excited in us:
- by objects that move our nerves and 
- by other causes. 


I define the passsions of the soul as those perceptions which relate to the soul itself.

This does not include the bodily perceptions. 

<!-- All our perceptions, both those attributed to objects outside of us and those attributed to various affections of our body, are truly passions with regard to our soul, 

when taking this word in its most general meaning, it is customary to restrict it to signify only those  

And it is only these last ones that I have undertaken to explain here under the name of the passions of the soul. -->



### 26. Imaginations That Depend Only on the Spirits Can Be as True Passions as Perceptions That Depend on Nerves

 <!-- Fortuitous Movement of -->

All the things that the soul perceives through the nerves can also be represented to it by flow of the animal spirits.

 <!-- the fortuitous course of  that enter the brain through the nerves -->

The only difference is that the nerve-based impressions are usually clearer and more vivid than spirits-based impressions.

This made me say in Article 21 that the spirits-based impressions are like the shadow or painting of the nerve-based impressions.

Sometimes, this painting is so similar to the thing it represents.

We can be deceived about the perceptions from:
- external objects or
- our body

But we cannot be deceived in the same way about the passions.
- This is because they are so close and so internal to our soul.

 <!-- that it is impossible for it to feel them without them truly being as it feels them.  -->

Thus, we can imagine things so strongly when were are asleep and awake. 
- We feel them outside of us or in our bodies even if they are not there at all.

 <!-- often when one is asleep, and even sometimes when awake, one imagines certain things  that one thinks one sees them before oneself or feels them in one's body, although they  -->

But when we feel the passions, we really feel them in our soul.  

<!-- But although one is asleep and dreaming, one cannot feel sad or moved by some other passion without it being very true that the soul has this passion within itself. -->
