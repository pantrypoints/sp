### 153. What Generosity Consists Of

True generosity enables a person to esteem themselves as highly as they legitimately are.

It consists only partly in recognizing that:
- nothing truly belongs to them except the free disposition of their will
- they should only be praised or blamed for using it well or poorly.

It also partly consists in feeling within oneself a firm and constant resolve to use it well—that is, to never lack the will to undertake and execute everything they judge to be the best course of action.

This is what it means to follow virtue perfectly.


### 154. How Generosity Prevents Contempt for Others

Those who have this understanding and sense of themselves are easily persuaded that every other person can also have the same understanding and sense of themselves because it does not depend on anyone else.

Therefore, they never despise anyone. Even though they may often see others committing mistakes that reveal their weaknesses, they are more inclined to excuse than to blame them, believing it to result more from a lack of understanding than from ill will.  

Just as they do not consider themselves much inferior to those who have more wealth, honors, intelligence, knowledge, beauty, or any other perfections, they also do not regard themselves as much superior to those whom they surpass in such things.

This is because all these attributes seem insignificant to them compared to the good will for which they esteem themselves—and which they assume, or at least believe, can also exist in every other person.


### 155. What Virtuous Humility Consists Of

Thus, the most generous individuals are usually the most humble. Virtuous humility consists in the reflection we make on the frailty of our nature and on the mistakes we may have committed in the past or are capable of committing, which are no less than those that others may commit.

This reflection prevents us from placing ourselves above anyone else and makes us consider that others, having free will just like us, can use it just as well.
