### 165. Hope and Fear

Hope is a disposition of the soul to believe that what it desires will happen, caused by a particular movement of the spirits, namely a mixture of Joy and Desire.

Fear, on the other hand, is a disposition of the soul that persuades it that what it desires will not happen. It is noteworthy that, although these two passions are opposites, they can coexist when one considers various reasons simultaneously, some of which make the desired outcome seem achievable, while others make it appear difficult.

### 166. Security and Despair

One of these passions never accompanies Desire without leaving some room for the other. When Hope becomes so strong that it completely eliminates Fear, it transforms into Security or Assurance.

Once assured that what is desired will occur, one may still wish for it but ceases to be agitated by the passion of Desire, which sought the event with unrest. 

Similarly, when Fear becomes so extreme that it leaves no room for Hope, it turns into Despair. Despair, by presenting the desired thing as impossible, extinguishes Desire, which only concerns itself with possibilities.


### 167. Jealousy

Jealousy is a type of Fear related to the Desire to retain possession of some good. It arises not so much from strong reasons to believe that one might lose it, but from the high value placed on it. This high regard leads to scrutiny of even the smallest causes for suspicion, interpreting them as significant reasons for concern.


### 168. When This Passion Can Be Virtuous

Since greater care should be taken to preserve significant goods than lesser ones, this passion can be just and honorable in certain situations. For instance, a captain guarding an important position has a right to be vigilant, mistrusting all potential threats. Similarly, a virtuous woman is not criticized for being jealous of her honor—avoiding not only wrong actions but also any grounds for gossip.


### 169. When It Is Blameworthy

An avaricious person is mocked for being jealous of their treasure, continually watching over it and refusing to part from it for fear of theft, as money is not worth such vigilance.

A man who is jealous of his wife is scorned because it shows he does not love her rightly and has a poor opinion of himself or her. True love would leave no inclination for distrust. 

Instead, he values not the person but the benefit of exclusive possession. He would not fear losing this benefit unless he believed himself unworthy or suspected her infidelity. This passion pertains only to suspicions and distrusts, as it is not jealousy to avoid harm when one has legitimate cause to fear it.
