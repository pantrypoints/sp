### 174. Cowardice and Fear

Cowardice directly opposes Courage, manifesting as a languor or coldness that prevents the soul from executing tasks it would undertake if free from this passion.

Fear or Dread, opposing Boldness, is not only coldness but also a disturbance and astonishment that incapacitates the soul against impending harm.


### 175. The Use of Cowardice

While nature does not instill entirely vicious passions, the utility of Cowardice is hard to discern.

Perhaps it serves by preventing unnecessary effort when more certain reasons deem it futile, sparing the soul from unnecessary troubles and preserving physical strength.

Yet, it is usually harmful, diverting the will from beneficial actions. Since it stems from insufficient Hope or Desire, increasing these two passions can remedy it.


### 176. The Use of Fear

Fear or Dread, however, seems neither praiseworthy nor useful. It is not a distinct passion but an excess of Cowardice, Astonishment, and Fear, always harmful. 

Boldness, by contrast, is an excess of Courage, always virtuous if the goal is good. Since surprise chiefly causes Fear, preparation and deliberation are the best defenses.


### 177. Remorse

Remorse of conscience is a type of Sadness stemming from doubt over whether an action is good. Doubt is essential, for if one were certain of wrongdoing, they would abstain, as the will pursues only apparent good. 

If one were sure of past wrongdoing, they would feel repentance rather than mere Remorse.

This passion’s use is in prompting examination of doubtful actions and deterring repetition without certainty of their goodness. However, since it presupposes evil, it is best avoided by using the same means to prevent Indecision.


### 178. Mockery

Derision or Mockery is a mix of Joy and Hatred, arising from noticing a slight flaw in someone deemed deserving of it. Hatred targets the flaw, while Joy arises from its presence in someone seen as fitting.

When unexpected, the surprise leads to laughter, reflecting the nature of laughter itself. However, the flaw must be minor, as significant faults provoke less joy unless one harbors much Hatred or malice.
