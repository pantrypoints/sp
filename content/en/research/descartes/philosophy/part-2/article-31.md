## 31. How innumerable diverse motions* may be in the same body

<!-- n n="This is now called Brownian Motion" -->

<!-- But every body also has a certain proper motion of its fibers, since it is understood to  -->

A body only moves away from bodies which are contiguous and at rest.

If it becomes a part of other bodies having other motions, then it can also participate in those other motions that can be infinitely many.

<!-- , if indeed it  -->

If someone walking on a ship carries a clock, its wheels will be moved by 4 motions:

1. The single, proper motion of the clock's mechanism, as a unit of the clock.
<!-- their fibers. -->

2. The motion of the man whom it is joined to, and makes up one unit with him.

<!-- But they will also participate in another [motion], insofar as they are joined to the walking man, composing one part of matter with him,  -->

3. The motion of the ship fluctuating in the sea, to which the man is joined to and forms a unit of. 

4. By the motion of sea to which the ship is joined to.

5. By the motion of the Earth to which the sea is joined to.

 <!-- they are joined to the earth itself, if indeed the whole earth moves.  -->

All these motions will truly be in the wheels of that clock. 

But it is not easy to understand or recognize so many motions at once.

This is why we consider each motion of each body only. 

<!-- , nor can all of them be recognized, it will suffice to consider that single one which is proper to each body. -->



## 32. How the proper cost of movement, which is also unique in the body, is taken for the sake of many.

Every single motion of a body is also made up of multiple motions.

<!-- , insofar as it is considered to be its own and peculiar to it, can be considered as  -->

An example is the wheels of carts having 2 different motions:

1. The circular motion around their axle
2. The straight motion along the length of the path that they travel

 <!-- along which they are carried -->

**But these motions are not truly distinct.** 

Each point of the moving body describes only one line. 

Nor does it matter that this line is often very curved, and so seems to be generated by many different motions. 

This is because we can imagine, in the same way, that any line whatsoever, even a straight line, which is the simplest of all, can arise from infinitely many different motions. 


For example, line `AB` is carried towards `CD`.

At the same time, point `A` is carried towards `B`. Then point `A` will draw the straight line `AD` which will depend on 2 straight motions:

1. From `A` to `B`
2. From `A` to `D`

<!-- than the curved line which is described by any point of a wheel depends on a circular and a straight motion. -->

And so, although it is often useful to distinguish a single motion into several parts in this way, for the purpose of easier understanding, yet, speaking absolutely, only one motion is to be counted in each body.
