## 45. The rules for determining how much the motion of each body is changed because of the collision of other bodies

Collisions with other bodies cause bodies to:
- increase or decrease their motions, or
- turn elsewhere

In order to calculate such changes, we only need to:
- subtract the amount of force in each, either to move or to resist motion, and
- establish for certain that which is stronger always achieves its effect.

This could easily be deduced by calculation if:
- only 2 bodies encountered each other mutually
- they were perfectly hard, and separated from all others.
  - In this way, their motions were not impeded by any other surrounding bodies, nor assisted.

They then would follow the following rules.


## 46. Rule 1

Assume Body `B` and `C`, were perfectly equal and moving at equal speeds. `B` is moving from right to left, and `C` from left to right.

When they encountered each other, they would be reflected and then continue to move, `B` to the right, and `C` to the left, without any loss of their speed.


## 47. Rule 2

If `B` were just slightly larger than `C`, then only `C` would be reflected. Both would move to the left with the same speed.

## 48. Rule 3

If they were equal in mass, but `B` moved slightly faster than `C`, they would both continue moving to the left. Some of `B`'s excess speed would be transferred to `C`. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cb3.jpg" a="CB3" >}}

If:
- B had 6 units of speed
- C had 4 units

After the collision, each would move to the left with 5 units of speed.


## 49. Rule 4

Assume body `C` were completely at rest and slightly larger than B. No matter how fast `B` moved towards `C`, it would never move `C`.

Instead, it would be repelled by `C` in the opposite direction. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cb4.png" a="CB4" >}}

This is because a stationary body resists high velocity more than low velocity, in proportion to the excess of one over the other.

Therefore, the force in `C` to resist would always be greater than in B to propel.


## 50. Rule 5

Assume that body `C` were stationary and smaller than `B`.

No matter how slowly `B` moved towards `C`, it would move `C` with it, transferring a portion of its own motion to it, so that both would subsequently move at the same speed. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cb5.png" a="CB5" >}}

Specifically, if `B` were twice as large as `C`, it would transfer to `C` 1/3 of its motion.

This is because that 1/3 would move the body `C` as quickly as the remaining 2/3 would move the body `B`, which is twice as large.

So, after `B` had encountered `C`, it would move 1/3 slower than before. It would take the same amount of time to move through a space of 2 feet as it did before to move through a space of 3 feet. 

Similarly, if `B` were 3 times larger than `C`, it would transfer to `C` 1/4 of its motion, and so on for the rest.


## 51. Rule 6

If the mass of stationary body `C` were precisely equal to that of the moving body `B`, when `B` approached `C` with 4 units of speed, it would:
- transfer 1 unit of speed to `C`
- be reflected with the remaining 3 units in the opposite direction.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cb6.png" a="CB6" >}}


## 52. Rule 7

Assume `B` and `C` were moving towards the same direction.
- `C` was moving slower, with `B` eventually catching up to it
- `C` were larger than `B` 
- The speed of `B` was greater than the excess of size in `C`

Then `B` would transfer just enough of its motion to `C` so that both would subsequently move at the same speed and direction.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cb7.png" a="CB7" >}}

However, if the excess of speed in `B` were less than the excess of size in `C`, then `B` would be reflected in the opposite direction and retain all of its motion. 

These excesses are calculated as follows:

- If `C` were twice as large as `B` and `B` did not move twice as fast as `C`, it would not propel `C` but would be reflected in the opposite direction.
- If it moved more than twice as fast, it would propel `C`. 

For instance, if `C` had only 2 units of speed and `B` had 5, subtracting 2 units from `B` would transfer only 1 unit to `C`. 

This would make both bodies move with 3 units of speed thereafter. This is because `C` is twice as large as `B`.

This would result in both bodies, `B` and `C`, moving with 3 units of speed.

This reasoning applies similarly to other cases. 

<!-- There is no need to prove these, as they are self-evident. -->
