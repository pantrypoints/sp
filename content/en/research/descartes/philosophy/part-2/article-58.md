## 58. If fluid particles move more slowly than a hard body within in it, then it does not have the character of a fluid.

Body `B` will begin to move when:
- it is pushed by a force from `F` going to `C`
- the fluid particles that hindered it from moving towards `C` change their determination.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/bfc.jpg" a="BFC" >}}

Body `B` will move with the same speed as that force assuming that the fluid move at least equally as fast as that force. 

But if the fluid moves slower than the force, then they will not be fluid. 

The slightest force would not be enough to move the hard body.
- Instead, a stronger force is required to overcome the resistance from the slowness of these fluid particles. 

Hence, we often see air, water, and other fluids:
- strongly resisting bodies that move very quickly within them
- yielding easily to them when those bodies move more slowly.

<!-- therefore we often see air, water and other fluids strongly resist bodies that are driven very quickly in them, and yield to them without any difficulty, when they proceed more slowly. -->

<!-- with the same speed with which a different force from the fluid drives it, if we assume that in this fluid there are no particles that do not move faster, or at least as fast. 

If the fluid moves slower  it does not have the nature of a fluid,

nor is the smallest force then sufficient to move the hard body existing in this fluid, but so much is required as to overcome the resistance arising from the slowness of those fluid particles. 
 -->

<!-- LX. It cannot, however, acquire a greater speed from that fluid than it has from the hard [body] by which it was impelled.

It only remains here to explain why I did not say a little earlier that the determination of the particles ayuo is changed absolutely, but changed insofar as this is required not to impede the motion of the body B. For this body B cannot move faster than it is impelled by the adventitious force; although often all the particles of the fluid FD have much more agitation. And this is one of the things that we must particularly observe in philosophizing, so as not to attribute any effect to a cause that exceeds its power. Thus, assuming the hard body B, previously at rest in the middle of the fluid FD, is now being impelled with slow motion by some external force, for example by my hand, since this single impulse of my hand is the cause why it moves, it is not to be believed that it moves faster than it is impelled; and although all the fluid particles move much faster, it is not to be thought that they are determined to the circular motions aeioa and ayuoa and the like, which are faster than this impulse, but that they, insofar as they are driven faster, are carried in any other directions, as before. -->


## 59. A hard body, pushed by another hard body, does not borrow all its motion from it, but also partly from the surrounding fluid

When body `B` is thus moved towards `C`, its motion does not come solely from the external force pushing it.
- Rather most of it comes from the fluid particles.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/fbc.jpg" a="FBD" >}}


Those which make up the circles `AEIO` and `AYUO` lose as much of their motion as those acquired by the particles of body `B` between `O` and `A`.

This is because they will now be part of the circular motions `AEIOA` and `AYUOA`. 

As they proceed further towards `C`, they will join new fluid particles.


## 60. However, it cannot acquire more speed from this fluid than what it already has from the impacted solid

 <!-- has from the solid against which it is impacted. -->

Why did I not say that the absolute direction of the fluid particles is changed? Why is it that it is changed only to the extent required to not impede body B's motion?

Body `B` cannot move faster than it is propelled by an external force even though all the particles of fluid `FD` often have much more agitation.

<!-- This is one of those things that we must particularly observe in our philosophical considerations, so as not to attribute any effect to a cause that exceeds its power.  -->

Assume that the body `B` is initially immobile within of fluid `FD`. 
- It is now propelled by some external force such as my hand with a slow motion.
- The impetus from my hand is not the sole reason for it to move faster.

 <!-- than it is propelled.  -->

My hand made the fluid particles move much faster [in circular motions]. 
- But they cannot move in circular motions faster than this impetus.

Instead, they are propelled towards any other parts as before, only faster.
