## 1. The works of God cannot be thought of as too vast.

The principles of material things are derived not from the prejudices of the senses, but from the light of reason in such a way that we cannot doubt their truth.

<!-- , we must examine whether we can explain all the phenomena of nature from these principles alone.  -->

We must begin with principles that are most universal and upon which the others depend, namely, the general structure of the entire visible world. 

But first we must consider 2 things:

1. We should always bear in mind the infinity of the power and goodness of God

In this way, we avoid the mistake of imagining his works to be too great, beautiful, and perfect. Instead, we must not put limits to those which we have no certain knowledge. This will prevent us from thinking less highly of the power of God.


<!-- Having now ascertained certain principles of material things, which were sought, not by the prejudices of the senses, but by the light of reason, and which thus possess so great evidence that we cannot doubt of their truth, it remains for us to consider whether from these alone we can deduce the  -->

<!-- Can we explain all the phenomena of nature from the principles of material things? 

We will begin with the most general phenomena on which the others depend -- the general structure of this visible world.

But first we must consider 2 things:

 -->

<!-- Of phenomena, or experiments; and what is the use of them for philosophizing. Now the principles which we have already found are so vast and so fertile, that many more of them follow, than we see contained in this visible world; and even many more things than our thinking mind can ever explore. But now we present before our eyes a brief history of the principal phenomena of nature (the causes of which are here to be investigated); not indeed that we use reasonings themselves as if to prove anything; for we desire the accounts of effects to causes, but not to and against causes Elzevier, p. 72 to deduce from effects: but only in so far as we judge from the innumerable effects, which AT VIII-1, 82 can be produced from the same causes, we determine our mind to some powers rather than considering others. -->



## 2. We should not think too highly of ourselves 

2. We tend to put limits to the world, without being assured of their existence either:
- by natural reasons or
- by divine revelation.
<!-- beware lest, in our presumption, we imagine that the ends which God proposed to himself in the creation of the world are understood by us. -->

<!-- The second is, that we should beware of presum too highly of ourselves, as it seems we should do if we supposed , as if -->

Putting limits on the world will make the power of our thought extend beyond what God has made in reality.

It will lead us to believe that:
- all things were created by God for us only.
- our intellect could comprehend the ends which God proposed to himself in creating the universe.

<!-- ; but likewise still more if we persuaded ourselves that , or if we merely supposed that we could comprehend by the power of  -->


## 3. How were all things were created for the sake of man?


Morally, it may be pious to believe that God made all things for us. It can incite us to be more thankful and loving towards him.

It is even in some sense true, because we can imagine using anything in existence. This will lead us to believe that all things were created for us.

 <!-- there is no created thing of which we cannot make some use, if it be only that of exercising our mind in considering it, and honouring God on account of it, it is yet by no means probable that  in this way that God had no other end in their creation. -->

But this supposition would be plainly ridiculous and inept in physical reasoning because there are many things that exist that we cannot see or know, and were not useful to us.
 <!-- , for we do not doubt but that many things exist, or formerly existed and have now ceased to be, which were never seen or known by man, and were never of use to him. -->


## 4. Phenomena and experiments, and their use in philosophy. 

<!-- The principles we have already discovered are so vast and fruitful that far more follows from them than we see contained in this visible world; indeed, far more than our minds can ever survey in thought. But now we will set before ourselves  -->

The following is a brief history of the principal phenomena of nature. I will investigate their causes here. 

<!-- , the causes of which are to be investigated here; not that we may use them as reasons for proving anything—for we wish to deduce the reasons for effects from their causes, not, conversely, the causes from their effects—but rather that from the innumerable effects which we judge can be produced by the same causes, we may determine our minds to consider some rather than others." -->



## 5. To us, at first glance, the Earth appears much larger than all other bodies in the universe

The Sun and Moon seem to be much smaller than the Earth, but not so small as to be imperceptible. 

We can easily calculate the distance between the Earth and the Moon to be about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, and the distance between the Sun and the Earth to be about a hundred times the diameter of the Earth. 

These calculations are based on the apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon, which we can observe and measure

<!-- Nobis quidem, primo intuitu, Terra caeteris omnibus mundi corporibus multô major effe videtur, & Sol & Luna caeteris ftellis fed vifûs defe&um indubitatis emendantes, inprimis advertimus Lunae à Terra diftantiam circiter triginta Terrae diametros ratiociniis aequare, Solis verô fexcentas aut feptingentas. Quas cum apparentibus Solis & Lunae diametris conferentes, facile ex ipfis colligimus, Lunam quidem diftantias ef[e multô minorem Terra, fed Solem elfe multô majorent. -->


## 6. What is the distance of the planets from the Sun?

Mercury is more than 200 Earth diameters away from the Sun.

Venus is more than 400.

Mars is 900 or 1,000.

Jupiter is 3,000 or more.

Saturn is 5-6,000.

<!-- Agnofcimus etiam, vifu ratione adjuto, Mercurium plus ducentis Terrae diametris à Sole diftare Venerem plus quadringentis Martem noningentis aut mille Jovem tribus millibus & ampliùs; ac Saturnum quinque aut fex millibus. -->


## 7. The fixed stars are not too near.

<!-- As for the fixed stars, the phenomena do not allow us to believe that they are no more distant from the Sun or Earth than Saturn is, but  -->

Nothing prevents us from supposing that the fixed stars are at any immeasurable distance. 

It is inferred from the motions of the heavens, explained below, that they are so distant from us that Saturn, compared to them, seems very near.

<!-- 7 Fixas non pojfefupponi nimis remotas. 

Quantum autem ad Fixas, non permittunt quidem phaenomena, ut ipfas à Sole aut Terra non magis quàm Saturnum diftare arbitremur; fed nulla obftant, quominùs ad quantumlibet immenfam diftantiam recolligiturque ex motibus motas effe fupporimus: colligiturque ex motibus coeli infrà explicandis eas à nobis effe adeô diftantes, ut Saturnus ad ipfas comparatus videatur admodum propinquus. -->


## 8. The Earth is not visible from the sky, nor does it appear to be a planet, nor is it comparable to Jupiter or Saturn. 

The Moon and Earth are smaller compared to Jupiter or Saturn, as Jupiter or Saturn are smaller compared to the Sun.

<!-- lest we should rashly judge the parts of the world to be incomparable, it is fitting that  -->

And so, we should not compare the Moon, or Earth, or Sun, to the stars in terms of size.

<!-- 8 Terram è cœlo confpeâam, non apparituram effe, nifi ut Planetam, Jove aut Saturno minorent.

Ex quibus manifeftum eft, Lunam & Terram, fi ex Jove vel Saturno confpicerentur, multô minores effe apparituras,quàm appareant Jupiter & Saturnus e Terra confpedi nec forte etiam Solem majorem vifum iri, fi refpiceretur ex Fixis, quàm Fixée nobis è Terra videntur : atque idcirco, ut fine prasjudicio partes mundi afpedabilis inter fe comparemus, cavendum
effe ne Lunam, vel Terram, vel Solem magnitudine Stellas fuperare arbitremur. -->
