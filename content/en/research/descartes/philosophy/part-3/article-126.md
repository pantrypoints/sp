## 126. The Initial Motion of a Comet

Let us assume that:
- `Star N` has more solidity than the air-aether globules which are distant from the center of `Vortex S`. [Therefore, it will not totally sink towards `S`]
- the air-aether globules of `Vortex S` are equal among themselves

It can initially be carried in various directions and move more or less towards `S`, depending on the various dispositions of other vortices it encounters. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/vortices.jpg" alt="Vortices" >}}

It can be variously retained or pushed by them, and also depending on its solidity. 

The greater its solidity, the more it resists being deflected by other causes from its initial direction.
 <!-- it was first sent.  -->

Nevertheless, it cannot be pushed with great force by neighboring vortices because it is assumed to have previously been at rest near them.

Therefore, it will not be carried contrary to the motion of vortex `AEIO` towards the parts between `I` and `S` but only towards those between `A` and `S`. 

It should eventually reach a point where the line described by its motion tangentially touches one of those circles according to which the air-aether rotates around center `S`. 
<!-- celestial matter -->


Once it reaches there, it continues its course further, moving increasingly away from center `S` until it eventually migrates from vortex `AEIO` to another.

For example, it might initially move along curve `NC`. 

`Point C` is where `NC` touches the disk created by the air-aether globules around center `S`. At `C`, `Star N` will immediately recede from `S` along the curved line `C2` situated between this disk and the straight line tangent to it at `Point C`. 

<!-- int `C`. 

As it reaches `C`, from the matter of the second element more distant from S than that which is at C and therefore moves more swiftly, it is more solid, as we assume. 

It cannot help but have greater force to continue its motion along the straight line tangent to that circle.  -->

But as soon as it reaches point `C`, it encounters the air-aether moving more swiftly*. This increases its speed and diverts it from the [pink] straight line which is a tangent to that disk. 

{{< n n="This is the Outer Area which is supposed to be faster than the Middle Area, but in reality (because of modern data) is not" >}}


This makes it go to `Curve C2`. `Star N` will come closer to the tangent line:
- the more solid it is
- the faster it is from `N` to `C`.




## 127. The Continuation of a Comet's Motion Through Various Vortices

As it progresses through this vortex `AEIO`, it gains such a force of agitation that it can easily migrate into other vortices and from these into others.

When it reaches `2` and exits the boundaries of `Vortex S`, **it still retains the air-aether flowing around it for a while.**

It only gets free from it when it penetrates sufficiently into `Vortex AEV`, specifically until it reaches `3`. 

In the same way, it carries the air-aether of this `Vortex AEV` with it towards `4` into the boundaries of the next vortex.

This process repeats with all successive vortices. 

 <!-- third, and from this third towards 8 into the boundaries of the fourth, and so on, always doing the same whenever it migrates from one vortex to another.  -->

Its path is curved depending on the different motions of the air-aether in the vortices that it passes through. 

Thus, its path `234` is curved differently from the previous `NC2` because:
- the air-aether of `Vortex F` rotates from `A` through `E` towards `V`
- the air-aether of `Vortex S` rotates from `A` through `E` towards `I`. 

However, path `5678` is almost straight because the air-aether of `Vortex Y` rotates around `Axis XX`. 

Stars that migrate from one vortex to another in this way are comets. 

<!-- I will try to explain all their phenomena here. -->
