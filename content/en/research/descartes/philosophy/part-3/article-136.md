## 136. Explanation of the Comet’s Tail Appearance

<!-- celestial -->
We apply this demonstration to air-aether globules. 


{{< i s="/graphics/d/refraction.jpg" a="Comet tail" >}}


These gradually get smaller from the sphere of Saturn on the line `CH` down to the Sun, as stated above.

- The largest balls are those beyond Saturn.
- The smallest balls are those near the Earth

Consequently, the rays of light there at `HC` are not bent.

 <!-- that action -->
The only difference is that the rays of light are:
- greatly bent or diverted in one direction
- bent gradually more and more the smaller the globules that they pass through become


{{< i s="/graphics/d/comet.jpg" a="Comet tail" >}}

For example:
- `S` is the Sun
- `2345` is the circle that the Earth draws each year, taking its course from `2` to `3` to `4`
- `DEFGH` is the sphere where the air-aether globules heaven cease to be equal and begin diminishing down to the Sun
  - This sphere, I said above, is not totally circular but rather much flatter towards the poles than the Ecliptic 
- `C` is a Comet situated beyond Saturn in our solar system


The rays of the Sun that go towards this comet reflect back towards the sphere `DEFGH`.

1. Most of those that meet this sphere at right angles at point `F` pass straight on towards `3`.

But others bend somewhat around the line `F3`, as towards `2` and `4`.

2. Most of those which meet it obliquely at point `G` also pass straight on towards `4`

The others bend much more towards `3` -- towards the center of the sphere

3. Most of those which meet it at point `H` pass straight on.

These do not reach the circle `2345`, but that those which bend toward the center of the sphere do reach it. 

Finally, those which meet this sphere towards `E` or `D` partly go straight, and partly bend.

This means the following:

1. If the Earth is at `3`, we see this Comet with a hair or coma equally scattered on all sides.

This is because the strongest rays that come in a straight line from `F` towards `3` represent its body.

The other weaker rays that are diverted and also come from `G` and `E` towards `3` show this hair.

This type of Comet has been called "Rose".


2. If the Earth is at `2`, we see the Comet through straight rays `CE2`.

We see its coma through all the curved rays passing between the lines `CE2` and `CD2` which converge towards `2`


3. If the Earth is at `4`, we see the Comet through the rays that follow the straight line `CG4`.

Its coma or tail extends towards a single side through the curved rays that come from `H` and all the other places between `G` and `H` towards `4`


The only difference in this case is that when the Earth is at `2`, this Comet will appear in the morning with its coma appearing to precede it.

When the Earth is at `4`, the Comet will be seen in the evening with a tail that it will drag behind itself.


{{< i s="/graphics/d/cometfix.jpg" a="Comet tail Fixed" c="We fix Descartes' refraction by simplifying it to concave and convex mirror analogies. Earth moving away from a comet will create a front facing tail because the increasing space acts a convex lens that flips the tail" >}}



## 137. Explanation of the appearance of fire chevrons


If the Earth is near point `5`, we will not be able to see the comet because the Sun will be in the way.

We will only see a part of its tail or hair, which will appear as a chevron of fire.

It will be visible either in the evening or in the morning depending on whether the Earth is closer to `4` or `2`.

Thus, if it is exactly at `5`, equally distant from those two others, the comet will perhaps show us 2 fire chevrons:
- one in the evening
- the other in the morning

This is through the curved rays that come from `H` and `D` towards `5`.

I say perhaps because if the comet is not very large, its rays will be so curved.

They will not be strong enough to be seen by our eyes.
