<!-- 28. Terrant, propriè loquendo, non moveri, nec ullos Planetas, quamvis à caelo tranfferantur.

Hîcque oportet eorum meminiffe qua? de naturâ motûs fuprà dicta funt a nempe illum quidem (fi propriè loquamur, & fecundùm rei veritatem), effe tantùm tranflationem unius corporis ex viciniâ eorum corporum, quœ ipfum immédiate contingunt & tanquam quiefcentiaspectantur, in viciniam aliorum.
Sed saepe etiam exufu vulgi actionem omnem, quâ corpus aliquod ex uno loco in alium migrât, motum vocari; & hoc fenfu dici poffe, eandem rem eodem tempore moveri ac non moveri, prout ejus locum varié determinamus. Unde fequitur nullum in Terra, nec etiam in aliis Planetis, motum propriè didum reperiri : quia non transferuntur ex viciniâ partium cœli quae illos immédiate contingunt, quatenus iflae partes cœli ut
immotse confiderantur. Ad hoc enim deberent ab omnibus fimul fejungi, quod non fit; fed quia materia cœli fluida eft, nunc unae ejus particulis, nunc aliae, à Planetâ quem contingunt removentur, idque per motum qui illis tantùm tribui débet, non autem Planetae : quemadmodum partiales tranflationes aquae & aëris, quae in terrae fuperficie fiunt, terrae, sed il lis aquae non tribui folent ipfi & aëris partibus quae transferuntur. -->


## 28. The Earth and the planets do not have a motion of their own 

 <!-- move even though they are transferred from the sky.  -->

<!-- Here, one must remember that the nature of motion as said above.

, is that it is only the transfer of one body from the vicinity of another body that is immediately adjacent to it, and that it is not the motion of the body itself. -->

Common people confuse true inherent motion with mere movement. They call the motion of a body its movement from one place to another. 

This is true. But it is not the same as the motion of the body itself. **This is because the body does not move of its own accord.** 

Instead, it is moved by the motion of its gravitational territory. In the same way, our sky is immediately moved by the motion of the Earth.

<!-- adjacent to the Earth are 
  parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to it, in the same way that the parts of the sky that are  -->

Therefore, there is no inherent motion in the Earth or in the other planets. 

<!-- This is because they are not transferred from the vicinity of the parts of the sky that immediately surround them, but rather 

they are moved by the motion of the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to them.

This is why the planets do not move of their own accord. Instead, they are moved by the motion of the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to them." -->



<!-- ### 29. Even if the Earth moved, it would not be proper to attribute its motion to 'motion' used by the common people. 

The Earth's motion is not like the motion of the other planets, which can be seen to move in the sky. 

Rather, the Earth is moved by the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to it. -->

 <!-- 's motion is a result of the motion of the  -->

<!-- , and it is not the Earth itself that moves. -->

<!-- The common people think that the Earth moves because they see the stars moving in the sky. And so they think that the Earth is moved in the same way. 

But the stars are fixed in their places and do not move of their own accord. 

Whereas, the Earth is moved by the motion of the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to it.

Therefore, it is not proper to say that the Earth moves by itself. Instead, it is moved by the motion of the sky immediately adjacent to it.

It would be foolish to say that the Earth is a globe in the heavens and that it moves. 

For the Earth is not a globe in the sky, but rather it is a flat plane, and it does not move of its own accord. 

The stars, on the other hand, are fixed in their places and do not move of their own accord. They appear to move because of the motion of the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to them. 

And so, it is not proper to say that the Earth moves, but rather that it is moved by the motion of the parts of the sky that are immediately adjacent to it. -->




## 29. The Earth does not move by itself, even if it and the other planets are seen to move. 

Common people set the positions of the stars by thinking that the Earth is immobile.

Then they judge the stars to move as they recede from such positions.

This is convenient and therefore reasonable for the purposes of life. 

All of us from childhood have thought that the Earth:
- is flat
- everywhere on it the same up and down, East, West, South, and North—exist

But any philosopher would notice that:
- the Earth is a globe contained in a fluid and mobile space. 
- the Sun and fixed stars always keep the same position among themselves

<!-- , were to use them as immobile to determine its position, and therefore affirm it to move, he would speak without reason.  -->

Philosophically, place should not be determined by very distant bodies, such as the fixed stars, but by those contiguous to that which is said to move. 

<!-- And then, according to common usage, there is no reason to consider the fixed stars immobile rather than the Earth, except that he thinks there are no other bodies beyond them from which they could be separated and in respect to which they could be said to move, while the Earth remains at rest in the sense that he says the Earth moves in respect to the fixed stars. 

But thinking this is unreasonable;  -->

Our mind thinks that the universe is infinite. 

If we consider the immensity of God and the weakness of our senses, we can suspect that beyond all those fixed stars are other bodies comparable to the stars and the planets. 

<!-- , in comparison with which the Earth can be said to rest, and all those stars together to move, than to suspect that no such bodies can exist. -->


## 30. All planets revolve around the Sun. 

The motion of the Earth is similar to the motion of the other planets.

The Earth and the other planets are carried along by a common vortex, with the Sun at its center and move in the motion of the vortex.

If obstructions are placed in the water where rivers flow, the water forms a vortex and carries along with it the obstructions.
- Some of them even turn around their own centers and perform a complete rotation faster than the center of the vortex.

The motion of the planets is always circular. 
- But it is rare for them to describe perfect circles.
- Instead, they deviate slightly in longitude and latitude.
