## 65. The poles of each vortex of the heavens touch parts of other vortices far from their poles.

No matter how the individual vortices were moved from the beginning, they will be arranged so that each one moves in the direction in which the motion of all surrounding vortices opposes it the least.

<!-- because the laws of nature are such that -->

This is because the motion of each body can easily be deflected by encountering another body.

<!-- world-13eee.jpg -->

- `Vortex S`, with center `S`, moves from `A` through `E` towards `I`.
- `Vortex F`, with center `F`, must move from `A` through `E` towards `V`, if no other surrounding vortices interfere. Thus, their motions will best agree with each other. 
- `Vortex g`, forms a triangle with the centers `S` and `F`. It is connected with the other two vortices `AEI` and `AEV` in the line `AE`, should move from `A` through `E` upwards.

<!-- whose center is not in the plane SAFE but above it, , and which is  -->

- `Vortex f`, with center `f` cannot move:
  - from `E` towards `I` to agree with the motion of `Vortex S` because it would oppose the motions of Vortex `F` and `3`.
  - from `E` towards `V` like `Vortex F` because it would conflict with `Vortex S` and `3`.
  - upwards from `E` like `Vortex 3`, because it would conflict with `Vortex S` and `F`. 

Therefore, it must have one of its poles towards `E` and the other in the opposite direction towards `B`. It rotates around the axis `EB`, from `I` to `V`.


## 66. The motions of these vortices are somehow deflected to harmonize with each other.

These motions will have some conflict if the disks of the first 3 vortices (the orbits most distant from their poles) directly meet each other at the point `E`, where the pole of `Vortex f` is located. 

For instance, `IVX` are the parts of the other vortices next to pole `E`. It rotates from `I` to `V` to `X`. Then:
- `Vortex S` will scrape against it along the straight line `EI` and other parallel lines
- `Vortex F` will scrape against it along the line `EV`
- `Vortex g` will scrape against it along the line `EX`, thus somewhat opposing its circular motion.

<!-- according to the laws of motion  ecliptics IVX -->
But nature easily corrects this by slightly deflecting the disks of the first 3 vortices in the direction of the rotation of Vortex `f`. 


This results in them scraping against it not along the straight lines `EI`, `EV`, `EX`, but along the oblique lines `1I`, `2V`, `3X`, thereby fully harmonizing with its motion.


## 67. The poles of two vortices cannot touch each other.

<!-- Indeed, I believe there is no other way to conceive how the motions of these various vortices could be less conflicting with each other.  -->

If we suppose the poles of 2 vortices to touch each other, either both will move in the same direction and thus merge into a single vortex, or they will move in opposite directions and thus be in maximum conflict with each other. 

I do not presume to determine the positions and motions of all the vortices in the heavens.

<!-- , I believe it can generally be affirmed, and sufficiently demonstrated here, that  -->

However, the poles of each vortex are not as close to the poles of other adjacent vortices as they are to parts far removed from their poles.


## 68. These vortices are of unequal size.

The inexplicable variety in the positions of the fixed stars shows that the vortices around them are not equal in size. 

Fixed stars exist only at the center of such a vortex. This is evident from their light.

<!-- the light can be most accurately explained by such vortices, and by no other means, as will be evident from what has been said and from what will be discussed later.  -->

 <!-- nothing else in  by our senses other than -->
From the fixed stars, we perceive only their light and apparent position.

<!--celestial , we have no reason to attribute anything else to them except what we judge necessary to explain these two aspects.  -->
<!-- are as necessary to -->

But the vortices of air-aether revolving around them explain their light just as the unequal vortex sizes explain their apparent position.

<!-- s the unequal size of these vortices is to   -->

This inequality in size means that some vortices far from the poles touch the poles of others. This is how small and large vortices can fit together. 

<!-- However, if they are unequal, it is necessary that the parts of 

parts of others near the poles because the similar parts of larger and smaller vortices cannot fit together. -->
