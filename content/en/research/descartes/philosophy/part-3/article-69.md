## 69. The particles of the Fire-Aether flows from the poles of each vortex towards the center, and from the center towards other parts

They continuously flow towards the center of each vortex from the surrounding vortices, through the parts near its poles.

Conversely, it flows out from the center to other surrounding vortices through parts far from its poles. 

<!-- first heaven -->
For example, `AYBM` is the vortex of the Territory 1 with the Sun at the center. 
- Its southern pole is `A`.
- Its northern pole is `B`.

The whole territory rotates around that axis. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sun.jpg" a="Sun poles" c="We update Descartes' drawing with current model of the sun's magnetic field" >}}

The four surrounding vortices `KOLC` rotate around the axes `TT, YY, ZZ`, and `MM`, such that it touches:
- `O` and `C` at their poles
- `K` and `L`, far from their poles

All the air-aether in Territory 1 strives to move away from the axis `AB`. Thus, they tend more forcefully towards edges `Y` and `M` than towards `A` and `B`. 

This is because the pole of Vortex `O` at `Y` and the pole of Vortex `C` at `M` have the least resistance to the air-aether of Territory 1. 

This is also why the air-aether in Vortex `K` and `L` moves towards `S`:
- The pole at `A` offers the least resistance to `K`.
- The pole at `B` offers the least resistance to `L`.
<!-- , where there is not much resistance. -->

<!-- It encounters the parts of vortices K and L at A and B, which are farthest from their poles and thus have a greater force moving from L and K towards S than the polar parts of vortex S have to move towards L and K,  -->

This is also why the air-aether in Vortex `S` moves towards Vortex `O` and `C`.


## 70. The same is not true for the Air-Aether

This would also apply to the air-aether if no specific causes hindered its movement in that direction. 

However, the agitation of the fire-aether is much swifter than that of the air-aether.

The fire-aether always can pass freely through those small angles that the air-aether globules cannot occupy.
- This is even if both the fire-aether and air-aether in `Vortex L` began to move towards `S` at the same time from the midpoint between the `Center S` and `L`.

<!-- we would understand that -->

The fire-aether would have reached `Center S` faster than the air-aether. 

The fire-aether thus enters the `Space S`. It pushes the air-aether globules with such force:
- towards the ecliptic `eg` or `MY`
- especially towards the poles `fd` or `AB`.

Thus, it prevents those coming from `Vortex L` from approaching `S` more closely than up to a certain limit, which is marked by letter `B`. The same must be judged for `Vortex K` and all others.


## 71. The reason for this difference

The air-aether revolving around the `Center L` has the force to move away from `L` but also to maintain their speed.

These two forces somewhat conflict with each other.
- While they rotate in `Vortex L`, they are confined by other vortices around it.

 <!-- , which are to be understood above and below the plane of this figure.  -->

They cannot move towards `B` without slowing down between `L` and `B` compared to their speed between `L` and other nearby vortices, understood to be outside the plane of this drawing.

The greater the distance `LB`, the slower they will move.

This is because when they move circularly, they cannot spend more time passing between `L` and those other vortices than between `L` and `B`. 

Therefore, the force they have to move away from the `Center L` causes them to move somewhat towards `B`.

<!-- , where they meet the polar parts of vortex S, which yield to them easily; 

but conversely, the force they have to retain the speed of their motion prevents them from wandering so far as to reach S.  -->

They do not wander into the Territory of `S` because they maintain their own speed. 

**But this is not the case with the fire-aether.**

The fire-aether revolves with the air-aether and therefore strives to move away from the centers of the vortices in which it is contained.

**But it does not need to slow down at all as it moves away from those centers.**

This is because it almost always finds equal paths to continue its motions. These paths are the narrow spaces not filled by the air-aether globules.

Therefore, this fire-aether continuously flows towards `S` through the poles `A` and `B` from Vortex `K`, `L`, and many others.
 <!-- that are not shown in this figure. -->

This is because not all are in the same plane, nor can I determine their true position, size, or number. 

The fire-aether also flows out of `S` towards Vortex `O`, `C`, and many others.

 <!-- whose position, size, and number I do not define; nor do  -->

I do not know whether the fire-aether that leaves Vortex `O` and `C` immediately goes to Vortex `K` and `L` or diverges to many other vortices farther from Territory 1 before completing its cycle.
