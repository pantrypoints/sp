## 87. The Various Degrees of Speed in the Minute Parts of the Fire-aether



<!-- After explaining the nature of the first and second elements to the extent necessary to discuss the third, we must consider that the matter of the first element -->

The fire-aether does not have a single speed. 

 <!-- is not equally agitated in all its minute parts, but  -->

Often in a very small quantity, different degrees of speed are found. 

This is because they came from the worn down particles of the air-aether. 

<!-- can be easily demonstrated both from the manner in which its generation was described above and from its continuous use: 

for we assumed it to be generated from the fact that the particles of the second element, not yet spherical but angular and filling the entire space in which they were, could not move without their angles being worn down, 

the minute parts separated from them by this friction changed their shapes in various ways according to the different spaces they occupied, thus assuming the form of the fire-aether.  -->

The purpose of the fire-aether is to fill all the narrow spaces found around other bodies.

Hence, each of its minute parts was initially no larger than the angles of the particles from which they were cut, or than the space left in the middle by three mutually touching globules.

Therefore:
- some of them remained perfectly undivided
- others had to be indefinitely divided
  - These exited from narrow spaces whose shape was changing more and more.

<!-- at `G`. -->
For example, let there be 3 globules `ABC`. `A` and `B` mutually touch and rotate only around their own centers.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/globules.jpg" a="Globules" >}}

<!-- `C` touches the first at `E` rolls over it from E to I until it touches the second at point F. -->

`C` touches `A` and rolls over to red `C`.

 <!-- it from E to I until it touches the second at point F. -->

The fire-aether in the the green area can remain immobile.

 <!-- triangular space `FGI`, whether consisting of several fragments or just one, can meanwhile  -->

But the fire-aether in the red space must necessarily move. 

<!-- `FIED` No fragment so small can be designated between points D and F that is not larger than the one removed from there at each moment.  -->

<!-- Because the globule C, approaching B, causes the line DF to pass through innumerable different degrees of brevity. -->





## 88. Those slowest of the small particles easily transfer to others what little speed they have and then fuse to each other.

Among the fire-aether are particles which are less divided than the rest, and less rapidly agitated.

<!-- which, since they are supposed to have been cut off from the angles of the particles of the second, before they were turned into globules, and filled all the spaces alone, cannot but have very angular figures, and unfit for motion; whence it happens that they easily  -->

These easily:
- fuse to each other
- transfer most of their agitation into those other most minute fragments, which are agitated most rapidly.

This is because larger bodies, other things being equal, more easily transfer their agitation into smaller ones, than receive from those smaller than they.

<!-- Thus, the fire-aether:
- has some fragments that are less divided and less swiftly agitated than others

; since they are supposed to have been cut from the angles of the particles of the second element when they were not yet turned into globules and filled all the spaces alone, they must necessarily have very angular shapes and be unsuited for motion.
-->


## 89. Such sticking minute parts are mainly found in the fire-aether which move from the poles to the vortex center 

Such fire-aether move from the poles towards the center of their vortex in straight lines.

The least agitated particles go in a straight motion.

But the other particles which follow more oblique and varied motions are usually expelled from the path of this straight motion.

Then they gather into small masses.

<!-- , whose shape I want to consider carefully here. -->



## 90. What is the shape of these small particles, which I will call striated particles or virtual photons

<!-- What is the figure of these small particles, which will henceforth be called striated particles. Clearly, since they often pass through those narrow triangular spaces that are found in the middle of the three globules of the second element, which touch each other, they must take on a triangular figure in their width and depth. As for their length, it is not easy to determine, because it does not seem to depend on any other cause than the quantity of matter from which these small masses are formed; but it is enough to conceive of them as small columns, hollowed out with three striae twisted like spirals, so that they can pass by turning through those narrow passages, having the figure of a curvilinear triangle FGI, which are always found between the three globules of the second element, touching each other.  -->

<!-- For since they are oblong, and pass with very rapid motion between those globules of the second element, while the latter rotate with another motion around the poles of the heavens, it is clearly understood that their striae must be twisted like spirals; and indeed more or less twisted, as they pass through parts more remote or nearer to the axis of the vortex; because the globules of the second element rotate more quickly in those than in these, as has been said before. -->

The middle of 3 air-aether globules touching each other create narrow triangular spaces. These virtual photons must take on a triangular shape in their width and height when they pass through these. 

Their length is not easy to determine because it only depends on the abundance of fire-aether in them. 

They are small columns, hollowed out with 3 spirals like screw-threads. This lets them pass through those narrow passages while twisting, having the shape of a curvilinear triangle `FGI`.

This triangular hole is always found between the 3 air-aether globules touching each other.

The virtual photons are elongated and pass very rapidly between those air-aether globules which rotate around the poles of the gravitational territory. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/striated.jpg" a="Striated particle" >}}

This is why those virtual photons must have screw-threads to pass through those rotating globules very quickly.

They would be more twisted the closer they are to the axis of the vortex and less twisted the farther away. 

This is because the air-aether globules rotate faster near the axis.

<!-- These twists depend on whether they pass through parts closer or further from the axis of the vortex.

This is because the air-aether globules rotate faster when closer to the axis and rotate slower when farther.  -->



## 91. These virtual photons coming from opposite poles are twisted in contrary directions


They come towards the middle of the gravitational territory from opposite parts.
- some come from the South Pole
- others come from the North Pole

This happens while the entire vortex rotates around its axis. 

Those which come from the South Pole are twisted in the opposite way as those which come from the North Pole.

Magentic forces chiefly depend on this.



## 92. They only have 3 striations

<!-- XCII. There are only three striations in them. But lest anyone perhaps think that I assert without reason that there can only be three striations in these first element particles, since the second element globules cannot always all touch each other in such a way as to leave only triangular spaces around them, I wish it to be noted here that any other larger spaces which are often found between those globules, always have their angles perfectly equal to those of the triangle FGI, and as for the rest are in perpetual change; 

so that the striated particles of the first element, passing through them, must also take on the figure we have described.  -->

<!-- whence it happens that the less agitated matter of the first element which exists in it, must flow to one or two of its angles, and leave the remainder of the space to the more mobile matter, and more easily changing its figures, so as to accommodate them to all the motions of those globules. 

And if perhaps one of its particles, existing in one of those angles, extends itself there towards the part opposite to that angle, beyond a space equal to the triangle FGI, it must be expelled from there, and consequently diminished, when it happens that a third globule touches the two which make the angle in which it is situated. 

Namely, if the less agitated matter, occupying the angle G, extends itself towards D beyond the line FI, it will be thrust out from there by the globule C, and to that extent diminished, when this globule C approaches B, so as to close the triangle GFI. And because the particles of the first element, which are the largest in it and less agitated than the rest, cannot but often be so situated among three globules approaching each other, while passing through the long tracts of the heavens, they do not seem to be able to take on any determined figure, and abide in them for some time, except that which we have described.
 -->


These virtual photons can only have 3 striations.

The air-aether globules cannot always touch each other in such a way that only triangular spaces remain around them.

Any larger spaces found among these globules always have their angles exactly equal to those of the triangle `FGI`. The rest are in perpetual change. 

The virtual photons passing through them must also take on this shape.

For example, the globules `A, B, C, H` touch each other at points `K, L, G, E`. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/fig_36.jpg" a="Globules" >}}

They leave in their middle a quadrilateral space. Each of its angles is equal to each of the angles of the triangle `FGI`.

As these 4 globules move, that space continually changes shape.
- It sometimes becomes square, sometimes oblong. 
- It even occasionally divides into two other triangular spaces. 

Thus, the less agitated fire-aether existing in it must flow to one or two of its angles.

This leaves the rest of the space to the more mobile matter that more easily changes its shapes to accommodate all the movements of those globules.

If one of its fragments, existing in one of these angles, extends itself toward the part opposite that angle, beyond a space equal to the triangle `FGI`, it must be expelled from there and thus diminished when a third globule touches the two that form the angle it occupies.

For instance, if the less agitated matter occupying angle `G` extends itself towards `D` beyond the line `FI`, it will be driven out by globule `C`.
- This will diminish it as globule `C` approaches `B` to close the triangle `GFI`. 

The largest fire-aether particles are less agitated than the rest. 

They pass through long tracts of the sky. They often find themselves between 3 approaching globules. 

They are not able to take on any definite shape that remains in them for a while, other than the one we have described.


## 93. The various sizes of fire-aether particles among the virtual photons and minute particles

 <!-- striated -->

These elongated virtual photons differ greatly from the rest of the fire-aether.

Yet, I do not distinguish them from it as long as they are only among the air-aether globules. This is because:
- we do not notice any particular effect of them there, and
- we believe many others are contained in it
  - These are not much smaller and not more swiftly agitated

Between the very smallest particles and these virtual photons, there are innumerable other grades, as can be easily recognized from the inequality of the paths they pass through.
