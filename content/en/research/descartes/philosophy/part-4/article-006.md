## 6. The particles of the earth-aether in Region 3 are quite large.

They arose from the dissolution of spots, which consisted of the smallest remnants of the fire-aether. 

When fused together, each is composed of many such remnants and is quite large. They can withstand the impetus of the globules of the air-aether moving around them.

Because whatever could not withstand this, would be resolved again into the fire-aether or air-aether.


## 7. The earth-aether at Region 3 can be changed by the fire-aether and air-aether

They completely resist the globules of the air-aether.

Yet the earth-aether was formed from the fire-aether which naturally yields to the air-aether. 

This is why the earth-aether can be changed somewhat by its encounter with the fire-aether and air-aether.




## 8. The earth-aether are larger than the globules of the air-aether but less solid and less agitated.

These remnants of the fire-aether have various shapes. 

Some could only be fused together into earth-aether particles by leaving very many narrow passages.

These passages are permeable only to very subtle fire-aether.

Hence, although these particles are much larger than the air-aether globules, they:
- cannot be so solid
- cannot be capable of such agitation.

This causes them to have very irregular shapes.
- This makes them less suited for motion than the spherical air-aether globules. 

The fire-aether remnants from which they are composed are connected in numerous different ways.
- This makes them differ greatly from each other in size, solidity, and shapes
- Almost all their shapes are very irregular.



## 9. These earth-aether particles enveloped the Earth.

Although separated from each other, they incubated around the Earth when it was still rotating like fixed stars in its own vortex and had not yet fallen toward the Sun.

This was not a random scattering of these particles throughout the sky. 

Instead, they all gathered around sphere `M`, pushed towards the center `I` by the air-aether globules.

This was because those air-aether globules had greater force of agitation*. 
- This made them go away from that center.

### Superphysics Note

This was from being displaced by the earth-aether which occupied the empty space at the center. 
- The more dense the center was with the earth-aether, the more air-aether will be kicked out. 
- The more air-aether kicked out, the more gravity will be available to push down matter.

Therefore the more solid and massive the core is, the stronger will be the gravity.

<!-- IX. They initially lay upon each other around the Earth. Here it should be noted that as long as the Earth, like the fixed stars, revolved in its peculiar vortex and had not yet fallen towards the Sun, these particles of the third element, which surrounded it, although separated from each other, were not scattered haphazardly through the sky, but all gathered around the sphere M (see figure on the next page), lying upon each other; because they were pushed towards the center I by the globules of the second element, which, having a greater force of agitation, tried to recede from that center." -->
