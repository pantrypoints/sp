## 10. Various gaps between the fire-aether and air-aether were left around them.

The earth-aether particles were mutually pressing against each other. 

But they were not so fused perfectly. 

They left many gaps around them which were occupied by:
- the fire-aether
- the globules of the air-aether.

This was to be expected because they:
- had very irregular and diverse shapes
- were joined together without any order.


## 11. The air-aether globules were initially smaller, the closer to the Earth's center 

The globules closer to the Earth's center, mixed with the Earth-aether particles, were slightly smaller than those farther away. 

 <!-- upper ones: in the same way as shown above. -->
- This is similar to how the air-aether near the Sun gradually become smaller as they are closer to that center.

All these globules were not larger than those found around the Sun within Mercury's orbit. 

<!-- the sphere of .  -->

But they might have been smaller because the Sun is larger than the Earth ever was.

Therefore, they might have been smaller than those currently present around us. 

<!-- below -->
These surpass those within Mercury's orbit because they are farther from the Sun.


## 12. The passages between them were narrower

These globules retained passages among the earth-aether particles adapted to their size.

In this way, the slightly larger globules could not easily pass through them.



## 13. The thicker earth-aether particles were not always below the thinner ones

The larger and more solid earth-aether particles revolved uniformly around the Earth's axis. 
- They easily fused to each other due to the irregularities of their shapes. 

The more solid and thicker the particle was, the more it was driven towards the center by the surrounding air-aether globules.

**But the more solid particles could not always extricate themselves from the less solid ones in order to descend below them.** *

{{< n n="Is it because it was already so dense?" >}} 

Instead, they often retained the same order they had obtained when they were first formed, having smaller and thinner particles below them.

<!-- Larger and more solid particles of the earth-aether had smaller and thinner ones below them. 

They rotated uniformly around the axis of the Earth and easily adhered to each other due to the irregularities of their shapes.

The more solid and thicker the particle was, the more it was pushed towards the center by the globules of the air-aether surrounding it.

## 14. How were the various bodies in Region 3 formed?

<!-- When later the Earth rolled towards the Sun (the vortex in which it was before being consumed), not much change could arise in its inner and middle regions.

But the outer region many other diverse bodies distinguished in it, first two, then three, later four.  -->

Later, the Earth developed these 3 distinct regions.

It then rolled towards the Sun (with the vortex in which it previously was being absorbed).

At that point, no significant change could occur in its inner and middle region.

But the outer region, first two, then three, later four, and many other different bodies had to be distinguished in it.
