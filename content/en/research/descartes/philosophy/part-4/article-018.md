## 18. The second effect of air-aether motion: separate one body from another and purge liquids

When the particles of terrestrial bodies, especially liquids, are confusedly joined together, the air-aether globules tend to:
- separate some from others
- distinguish them into various bodies
- mix others more accurately*
  - They arranging them in such a way that each droplet of the liquid formed from them is entirely similar to all other droplets of the same liquid.


{{< n n="This is currently attributed to centrifugal and centripetal forces. But here, Descartes unifies them as properties of the 2nd Element in relation to identity, freedom, and confinement" >}}



When air-aether globules move through the passages of liquid terrestrial bodies, they constantly displace the earth-aether particles that come in their way.

The earth-aether particles become arranged among the others so that they no longer oppose the motions of each other. If they cannot be arranged in this way, they will be separated from the rest.*

{{< n n="Here, Descartes mixes up the properties of the Asian water-aether Element with the air-aether" >}}


Thus, we observe that from dregs, certain liquids are expelled:
- upward
  - This is attributed to levity
- downward
  - This is attributed to gravity
- the sides of the vessel

The wine subsequently becomes clarified, although it still consists of various particles. It appears transparent and no denser at the bottom than at the top. 

The same should be assumed for other pure liquids.





## 19. The third effect of air-aether motion: make suspended drops of liquids round 

<!-- these celestial globules have vastly different paths in a drop of water than in the surrounding air, and always move as much as possible along straight lines, or lines approaching straightness, it is evident that those in the air are less impeded in their motions by the presence of a water drop, maintaining their motion along lines deflecting as little as possible from straight lines, if the drop is perfectly spherical, rather than taking any other shape. 


For if there is any part on the surface of that drop that protrudes beyond a spherical shape, the celestial globules moving through the air will strike it with greater force than other parts, and thus push it towards the center of the drop; 

and if there is any part of the surface closer to the center than the others, the celestial globules contained within the drop will expel it from the center with greater force; 

and so all forces will concur to form a spherical drop.  -->


*Meteors* explained that the third effect of air-aether globules is to make drops of liquids, suspended in the air or another liquid different from them, round. 

<!-- hanging in the air or any other liquid, round, as I have explained . -->

These air-aether particles have to travel much longer around a water droplet than through physical air. 

To resume their usual straight-line path, they press on the droplet to make it perfectly round.
- This is because if one part of the droplet protrudes, then it would deflect the air-aether motion and prevent its straight-line movement and cause it to impact that protruding part more.
- This will cause the air-aether to push the protruding part towards the center of the droplet.

<!-- in the surrounding air and always move as much as possible in straight lines or approximately straight lines, those in the air are less hindered by their motions along lines deflecting as little as possible and can continue them more easily if the droplet is perfectly spherical.  -->

<!-- For if there is a part on the surface of this droplet that protrudes beyond the spherical shape, celestial globules flowing through the air will impact it more than the others.  -->



Likewise, if any part of the droplet is sunk closer to the center than the rest of the surface, the internal air-aether in the droplet itself [which is also rotating?] will push that sunken area more forcefully from the center.

And so all air-aether contribute to making a spherical droplet.

A straight line is most uniformly inflected in each of its points when it degenerates into a circular curve.

<!-- And since the angle of contact, by which alone a circular line differs from a straight one, is smaller than any rectilinear angle, and is equal everywhere only in a circular line, it is certain that 

And since the angle of contact, the only one that deviates from a straight line, is always smaller than any rectilinear angle, and in no curved line except a circular one is equal everywhere: 

it is certain that a straight line can never be more equally, and less deviate in each of its points than when it degenerates into a circular line. -->
