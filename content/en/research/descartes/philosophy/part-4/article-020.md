## 20. The second effect: gravity

<!-- The force of gravity does not differ much from this third action of celestial globules; for just as those globules, through their simple motion, by which they move indiscriminately in all directions, press all the particles of each drop equally towards its center, thus making the drop round; so by the same motion, being obstructed by the mass of the whole earth from moving in straight lines, they propel all its parts towards the center: and in this consists the gravity of terrestrial bodies.

XXI. All parts of the Earth, if considered alone, are not heavy but light. To understand this perfectly, it should first be noted that if all the spaces around the Earth, which are not occupied by the matter of the Earth itself, were empty, that is, if they contained nothing but a body that in no way hindered or aided the motion of other bodies (for thus only can the term "vacuum" be understood), and in the meantime, this Earth rotated around its axis in the space of twenty-four hours by its own motion, it would happen that all its parts, which were not very firmly bound to each other, would leap towards the sky in various directions: in the same way as can be seen when a spinning top rotates, if sand is thrown upon it, it immediately recedes from it and disperses in all directions; and thus the Earth would not be called heavy, but rather light. -->


The motion of the air-aether that makes droplets round also makes planets round. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/droplet.jpg" a="Surface Tension" c="In Cartesian Physics, surface tension and gravity have the same cause. The parts of a droplet go towards its center just as a planet's parts go to its own center. The space particles travel in straight lines that create a circular shape as an effect of the *fractal* nature of space particles." >}}


This phenomenon is the gravity of terrestrial bodies. 

<!-- force of gravity does not differ much from this third action of air-aether globules. -->

- This is caused by these globules moving indiscriminately in all directions.
<!-- , by their own motion alone, carries them -->
- This makes them uniformly press all particles of the Earth towards its center, making the Earth round.
- This pressing motion is impeded by the resistance of the Earth's mass. 
  - This in turn pushes all the Earth's particles towards the center.


## 21. All earth-aether particles, if considered alone, are light, not heavy*

{{< n n="This has been proven by 'heavy' things in zero gravity" >}}

A vacuum contains nothing that can impede or assist the motions of other bodies.

<!-- To fully understand its nature, it must first be noted that  -->

<!-- earth-aether -->


If we imagine that:
- all the spaces around the Earth became void
<!-- not occupied by the air-aether were a vacuum -->
- the Earth rotates around its axis with its own motion

Then:
- all the Earth's particles which not very firmly connected to each other would leap towards the sky from time to time
  - This is the same as how sand thrown in a whirlwind immediately disperses in all directions.
- the Earth would be considered light, not heavy.



## 22. Where Does the Lightness of the Air-Aether Come From?

 <!-- celestial matter -->

In reality:
- there is no void
<!-- vacuum -->
- the Earth is rotated by the surrounding air-aether that permeates it entirely

 <!-- and passing through all its pores -->

 <!-- celestial matter, , it has the character of a resting body.  gravity oranti-gravity -->

**The air-aether has no force of heaviness or lightness as long as it totally agrees in the motion that carries the Earth.**

{{< i s="/photos/physics/zerog.jpg" a="Zero G" c="The pushing force of gravity is negated by an airplane falling faster than that push. In Descartes-speak this is when it 'totally agrees in the motion that carries the Earth'" >}}

<!-- , has no force of gravity or levity;  celestial matter -->
<!-- gravity or levity;  -->

But in reality, they are hindered from their straight-line paths by their impact with the Earth. 

 <!-- as long as its parts have more agitation than they spend in this, therefore always hindered by the  in following , they always recede from it as much as they can and thus consist in their lightness. -->


## 23. How all parts of the earth are pushed downwards by the air-aether to become heavy
<!-- This Celestial Matter, -->

<!-- How all parts of the Earth are driven downward by that celestial matter, and thus become heavy. It must then be noted that  -->



<!-- And it must be noted that the force by which the matter of the heavens tends to move away from the center of the Earth cannot have its effect, except that those of its parts which move away from it rise in the place of some terrestrial parts which descend at the same time into theirs. 


 all the parts of the second element which compose that of the heavens have the same force, they do not drive one another out of their places, but because the same force is not in the Earth, when one of its parts is found further from its center than are parts of the heavens which can rise in its place, it is certain that they must rise there, and consequently make it descend into theirs. 

Thus heavy bodies are not pushed towards the center of the Earth by all the matter of the sky that surrounds it, but only by the parts of this matter that rise in its place when it descends, and which consequently are all together just as large as itself. 

For example, B is a rock demser the air. Its pores have far less air-aether than a similar size of the physical air above it. And so that air has far more air-aether. 

 it is obvious that what there is more of the matter of the sky in this portion of air than in this body B tending to move away from the center of the Earth has the force to make it approach it, and thus to give it the quality that we call its heaviness.

 its pores contain less of the heavenly matter than the portion of air that must rise into its place if it descends—it is evident that 


 the excess of air-aether  in that air moving away from the center of the Earth, has the force to make the rock B approach it.
 - This gives the rock its weight. -->



All the spaces around the Earth are occupied either by:
- the air-aether as space
- the earth-aether as physical air

**All the particles of the air-aether have equal force.** *
- This why the air-aether does not dislodge each other

{{< n n="This was proven by Galileo and now is called the Weak Equivalence Principle" >}}

This air-aether is not present in the Earth.

When material bodies parts are farther from the Earth's center than the air-aether below them, then that air-aether must rise to where the material bodies are.
- This will make the terrestrial parts descend into the former place pf that air aether.

<!-- This can only exert its effect when, during its ascent, it depresses and propels some terrestrial parts below itself into the space that it just left.  -->


**The air-aether globules all have equal power. None of them can displace the other.** 

<!-- of this celestial matter have an equal tendency to remove themselves from it, no individual has the power to displace others of its kind;  -->

But terrestrial bodies have a lesser content of air-aether. This creates an inequality among the air-aether.

<!-- This inequality allows the  


but since such a tendency is not as great in the particles of , whenever they have some of them above themselves, they must exert this force entirely on those.  -->

Thus the gravity of each terrestrial body is not produced by the air-aether surrounding it.

**Instead, it is produced only by those that immediately ascend in its place when the body descends. Therefore, they are exactly equal in magnitude to it.**


For example, `B` is a rock in the middle of the air. It naturally has more earth-aether content than air-aether.

  <!-- than an equal volume of air has earth-aether.  -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/earth.png" alt="Earth" >}}

<!-- Because it has more earth-aether, it means that it has less air-aether -- it has fewer or narrower pores that can contain the air-aether.  -->


If rock `B` descends towards `I`, it will displace an amount of air-aether that will rise into its place.  

This air-aether above it has the force to further depress that body. 


<!-- mass of air equal to it will ascend into its place; and because in that mass of air there is more celestial matter than in it, it is also evident that there is a force in it to depress that body."


the force which individual parts of celestial matter have to move away from the Earth cannot take effect unless, as they ascend, they depress and drive down some parts of terrestrial matter into whose place they succeed below them.



All the air-aether globules have an equal tendency to move away from the Earth.

Thus, each individual globule has no power to displace others of its kind.

But this tendency is not as strong in particles of terrestrial bodies.

Whenever there are earth-aether particles above earth-aether, the lower earth-aether? must exert their force entirely on them.

And thus, the gravity of any terrestrial body is not caused by the air-aether surrounding it. Instead, it is caused by the air-aether at the bottom of the body that then ascends [to leave the Earth] and take that body's place. 

Therefore, that air-aether is entirely equal to that body in size.

For example, let `B` be the earth-aether in the physical atmosphere as air. It has a higher ratio 

a terrestrial body in the atmosphere which has  and consisting of more particles of the earth-aether than an equal mass of air, and 

Therefore, it has fewer or narrower pores that has air-aether. If `Body B` descends towards `I`, a mass of air-aether equal to it will ascend into its place. -->

<!-- mass of air -->
<!-- More air-aether is in that space than in the body. And so that air-aether will exert a force in that body to depress that body. -->
