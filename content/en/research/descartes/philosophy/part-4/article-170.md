## 171. Why does a magnet attract iron?

A magnet and iron approach each other. 

There is no pulling force involved.

But as soon as the iron is within the sphere of magnetic influence, it borrows its force from the magnet.

The virtual photons exiting from both objects expel the intervening air-aether. 

This causes them to approach each other, just like two magnets would. 

Iron moves more freely than a magnet because it consists only of those particles through which the virtual photons can pass. 

But a magnet is burdened by its heavy stony material.



## 172. Why does an armed magnet (a magnet equipped with iron) support much more weight than a bare magnet?

<!-- But many wonder why a magnet equipped with iron, or an iron plate attached to a magnet, can support more weight than the magnet alone. -->

<!-- This is because even if it can support more weight with the added iron, it does not necessarily attract it more if it is even slightly removed from it.  -->

The armed magnet does not support more weight if a thin object is interposed between it and the iron.

**The increased force arises solely from the difference in contact.** 

The iron plate's grooves fit perfectly with the grooves of the attached iron. Therefore, the virtual photons passing through these grooves from one iron to another expel any intervening air. 

As a result, the surfaces in direct contact with each other are difficult to separate. 

**Direct contact is the best adhesive to bind two objects.**

However, the grooves of the magnet do not align as well with the grooves of the iron due to the stony material present in the magnet. 

Hence, there must always be a slight gap between the magnet and the iron to allow the virtual photons to pass from one set of grooves to the other.


## 173. Why do its (the magnet's) poles, no matter how opposite they are, attract each other when supporting iron?

Even though the poles of a magnet appear to have opposite properties, they still attract each other when supporting iron. 

In such a case, if both poles are equipped with iron plates, they can support nearly twice as much iron together as a single pole alone. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_83-4.jpg" a="Magnet and iron" >}}

For example, magnet `AB` has iron plates `CD` and `EF` attached to its poles. These protrude on both sides so that the iron `GH` touches them.

The iron `GH` can be approximately twice as heavy when it is supported by only one of these plates. 

This is because of the motion of the virtual photons. 
- They oppose in the sense that those entering through one pole cannot enter through the other.
- But this does not prevent them from cooperating in supporting the iron. 

When they come from the South pole `A` of the magnet and are reflected by the iron plate `CD`, they enter a portion `b` of the iron, creating its North pole `B`. 

Then, flowing up to the South pole `a`, they encounter the other iron plate `FE`, through which they ascend to the North pole B of the magnet. 

Conversely, when they exit from B, they pass through the armature EF, the suspended iron HG, and another armature DC, and return to A.


## 174. Why is the rotation of an iron wheel, suspended by the force of a magnet to which it is attached, not hindered?

The motion of the virtual photons through the magnet and iron does not align with the circular motion of the twisted iron wheels. 
- These wheels continue to rotate like a whirlwind while suspended from the magnet for a longer time than when they are detached and rest on the ground.

If the virtual photons were only moving in a straight line and had to encounter each individual passage of the iron, directly opposing the passages of the magnet from which they emerge, they should hinder the rotation of these wheels. 

However, the wheels themselves always rotate, some in one direction and others in the opposite direction.
- The particles must cross obliquely from the magnet's passages into the iron's channels, regardless of the wheel's rotation.
- This is why they easily enter its channels as if it were stationary. 

The motion of the wheel is less hindered by contact with the magnet, as it rotates while suspended, than it is by contact with the Earth when pressed by its own weight.


## 175. How and why does the force of one magnet increase or decrease?

The force of one magnet can increase or decrease in various ways when influenced by the presence of another magnet or iron.

The general rule is: **whenever the magnets are positioned in a way that one magnet sends virtual photons towards the other, they attract each other**. 

Conversely, if one magnet pulls these particles away from the other, they hinder each other. 

**The more rapidly and abundantly these particles flow through each magnet, the greater the magnet's strength.** 

When the particles are in a highly agitated state, more of them can be transferred from one magnet or iron to another compared to when the air or any other substance is present in the absence of a magnet.

Thus, not only do the South pole of one magnet and the North pole of another attract each other when supporting iron with their respective poles, but even when they are separated and the iron is placed between them. 


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_85-4.jpg" >}}


For example, magnet `C` is attracted to magnet `F` to hold the iron `DE` attached to it. Vice versa, magnet `F` is attracted to magnet `C` to support the end `E` of its iron in the air. 

It can be so heavy that it could not be supported by magnet `F` alone if the other end `D` leaned against a different object than magnet `C`.


## 176. Why can't a magnet, no matter how strong it is, attract iron that is not in direct contact with a weaker magnet?

In the meantime, a certain force of magnet `F` is hindered by magnet `C`, specifically the force it has to attract iron `DE` towards itself. 

As long as this iron is in contact with magnet `C`, it cannot be attracted by magnet `F`. This is even if we assume that magnet `F` is significantly stronger.

This is because the virtual photons passing through these 2 magnets and this iron, as explained earlier, have nearly equal force throughout the space between `C` and `F`.

Therefore, they cannot pull the iron `DE` towards `F`, not only due to the magnetic force but also because the iron is bound to magnet `C` through their contact.


## 177. Why can a weaker magnet or iron in contact with a stronger magnet attract itself?

<!-- This is why a weaker magnet or a small piece of iron often attracts another piece of iron from a stronger magnet.  -->

This only occurs when the weaker magnet is in contact with the iron it attracts from the stronger magnet. 

When 2 magnets, with different poles, touch an elongated piece of iron, one magnet at one end and the other at the opposite end.

Then these two magnets are separated from each other.
- The intermediate iron piece adheres to neither the weaker nor the stronger magnet consistently. 
- It can sometimes cling to one and sometimes to the other. 

There is no specific reason why it adheres to one magnet more than the other, except perhaps that it touches the one with a larger surface area.


## 178. Why, in these Northern regions, is the South pole of a magnet stronger than the North pole?

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_85-4.jpg" >}}

Magnet `F` assists magnet `C` in supporting iron `DE`.

This is why the South pole can support more iron than the other pole in these Northern regions. 

It is supported by the Earth, the largest magnet, in the same way that magnet `C` is assisted by magnet `F`. 

On the contrary, the other pole is hindered by the Earth due to its unfavorable position.
