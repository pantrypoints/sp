To Princess Elizabeth, Eldest Daughter Of Frederick, King Of Bohemia:

<!-- , COUNT PALATINE, AND ELECTOR OF THE SACRED ROMAN EMPIRE. -->

The greatest advantage I have derived from my published writings was being known to you and being able to talk to you.

<!-- has arisen from my having, through means of them, become known to your Highness, -->

<!-- and thus been privileged to hold occasional converse with one in whom so many rare and estimable qualities are united, as to lead me to believe I should do service to the public by proposing them as an example to posterity. 

It would ill become me to flatter, or to give expression to anything of which I had no certain knowledge, especially in the first pages of a work in which I aim at laying down the principles of truth. And the generous modesty that is conspicuous in all your actions, assures me that the frank and simple judgment of a man who only writes what he believes will be more agreeable to you than the ornate laudations of those who have studied the art of compliment. -->

<!-- This is why I will give insertion to nothing in this letter for which I have not the certainty both of experience and reason; and in the exordium, as in the rest of the work, I will write only as becomes a philosopher. -->

There is a vast difference between real and apparent virtues.

There is also a great discrepancy between those real virtues that proceed from an accurate knowledge of the truth, and such as are accompanied with ignorance or error.

The virtues I call apparent are only, properly speaking, vices, which, as they are less frequent than the vices that are opposed to them, and are farther removed from them than the intermediate virtues, are usually held in higher esteem than those virtues.

Thus, because those who fear dangers too much are more numerous than they who fear them too little, temerity is frequently opposed to the vice of timidity, and taken for a virtue, and is commonly more highly esteemed than true fortitude.

Thus, also, the prodigal are in ordinary more praised than the liberal.

None more easily acquire a great reputation for piety than the superstitious and hypocritical. With regard to true virtues, these do not all proceed from true knowledge, for there are some that likewise spring from defect or error; thus, simplicity is frequently the source of goodness, fear of devotion, and despair of courage. 

The virtues that are thus accompanied with some imperfections differ from each other, and have received diverse appellations. 

But those pure and perfect virtues that arise from the knowledge of good alone are all of the same nature, and may be comprised under the single term wisdom.

For, whoever owns the firm and constant resolution of always using his reason as well as lies in his power, and in all his actions of doing what he judges to be best, is truly wise, as far as his nature permits.

By this alone he is just, courageous, temperate, and possesses all the other virtues, but so well balanced as that none of them appears more prominent than another: and for this reason, although they are much more perfect than the virtues that blaze forth through the mixture of some defect, yet, because the crowd thus observes them less, they are not usually extolled so highly. 

Two things are needed for the wisdom thus described:

1. The perception of the understanding 

2. The disposition of the will


All men can have willpower. But people have different degrees of willpower for the understanding.  

<!-- The difference in the will in understanding  of some is inferior to that of others. -->

<!-- Those who have only an inferior understanding may be as perfectly wise as their nature permits, and may render themselves highly acceptable to God by their virtue, provided they preserve always a firm and constant resolution to do all that they shall judge to be right, and to omit nothing that may lead them to the knowledge of the duties of which they are ignorant; -->

A person is wiser than others if he:
- has a constant resolve of performing the right
- is especially careful in instructing themselves
- has a highly perspicacious intellect

I see that these 3 are in great perfection in you. 

Your desire of self-instruction is manifest.

<!-- , from the circumstance that neither the amusements of the court, nor the accustomed mode of educating ladies, which ordinarily condemns them to ignorance, have been sufficient to prevent you from studying with much care all that is best in the arts and sciences;  -->

<!-- The incomparable perspicacity of your intellect is evinced by this, that  -->

You penetrated the secrets of the sciences and acquired an accurate knowledge of them in a very short period. 

You understood my writings.
<!-- But of the vigour of your intellect I have a still stronger proof, and one peculiar to myself, in that I have never yet met any one who understood so generally and so well as yourself all that is contained in my writings.  -->
- Some men of the highest intellect and learning find them very obscure.

Almost all who are versant in Metaphysics are wholly disinclined from Geometry.

On the other hand, the cultivators of Geometry have no ability to investigate First Philosophy.

I know only you who find both studies congenial. 

<!-- insomuch that I can say with truth I know but one mind, and that is your own, to which both studies are alike congenial, and which I therefore, with propriety, designate incomparable.  -->

<!-- But what most of all enhances my admiration is, that so accurate and varied an acquaintance with the whole circle of the sciences is not found in some aged doctor who has employed many years in contemplation, but in a Princess still young, and whose countenance and years would more fitly represent one of the Graces than a Muse or the sage Minerva. -->

But most admirable is the fact that you achieved this at a young age. 

In conclusion, all that is needed for the mind to perfect wisdom and will is to be found in you. This is why I dedicate this work to you.

<!-- , but also all that can be required on the part of the will or the manners, in which benignity and gentleness are so conjoined with majesty that, though fortune has attacked you with continued injustice, it has failed either to irritate or crush you. -->

<!-- And this constrains me to such veneration that I not only think this work due to you, since it treats of philosophy which is the study of wisdom, but likewise feel not more zeal for my reputation as a philosopher than pleasure in subscribing myself -->
