We should only engage with objects which our minds can use to achieve sure knowledge.
<!-- and indubitable -->


All knowledge is certain and evident cognition.

<!-- ; nor is the person more learned who doubts many things than one who has never thought about them, but nevertheless seems less educated if they have formed a false opinion about something. 

Therefore, it is never better to study than to deal with objects so difficult that, being unable to distinguish the true from the false, we are compelled to admit doubtful things as certain, since in these cases there is not so much hope of increasing knowledge as there is danger of diminishing it.  -->

Thus, through this proposition, we:
- reject all merely probable cognitions
- establish that only those fully known and about which there can be no doubt should be believed. 

<!-- Educated people may persuade themselves that very few such things exist because they have neglected to reflect on such cognitions as being too easy and obvious to everyone due to a common human flaw

I warn that there are far more of them than they think and that they suffice for demonstrating countless propositions with certainty, about which they have so far only been able to discourse probably. -->

Educated people do not want to admit ignorance.

This is why they have gotten used to embellishing their fabricated arguments, gradually persuading themselves and peddling them as true.

<!-- However, if we observe this rule well, very few things will occur that are worth learning. For scarcely in any science is there a question about which ingenious men have not often disagreed among themselves.  -->

Whenever 2 opinions on the same matter oppose each other, at least one of them is deceived.

<!-- , and neither of them seems to possess knowledge: for if the reasoning of one were certain and evident, he could propose it to the other in such a way as finally to convince even his understanding.  -->

Therefore, we cannot acquire perfect knowledge from probable opinions because we cannot hope for more from ourselves than what others have accomplished. 

So only Arithmetic and Geometry remain which matches this rule [of using something that applies to all yet itself cannot be doubted].*

{{< n n="*Arithmetic and Geometry refer to the operations of the mind which we all use for everything and cannot be doubted. This is why Cartesian Philosophy is mechanistic" >}}


<!-- from the sciences already discovered, to which the observance of this rule reduces us. -->

<!-- Yet we do not condemn the method of philosophizing adopted by others hitherto discovered, and the most apt, tortures of probable syllogisms of the scholastics; indeed, they exercise the minds of children and promote emulation, which is far better to be informed by such opinions, even if it appears that they are uncertain, since among scholars there are controversies, than if they were left free to themselves. 

For they would perhaps proceed to precipice without a guide; but as long as they adhere to the footsteps of their teachers, although they sometimes deviate from the truth, they will certainly undertake the journey more safely, at least in this respect, which has already been approved by the more prudent.  -->

We ourselves rejoice that we were once educated in schools.

But we are now released, at a sufficiently mature age, from that oath that bound us to the Master.

<!-- - have finally withdrawn our hand from the rod . -->

<!-- , if we wish seriously to propose rules to ourselves, by whose help we may ascend to the summit of human knowledge, this one is certainly among the first to be admitted -->

Rule 2 is that we should not misuse leisure, as many do, neglecting whatever is easy and only occupying ourselves with difficult matters where we devise the most subtle conjectures which only increase the multitude of doubts without learning any science..

 <!-- and very probable reasons;  -->

<!-- but after many labors they perceive late that they have  -->

<!-- Now, however, because we said a little while ago that  -->

Arithmetic and Geometry alone exist free from any falsehood or uncertainty.

 <!-- among the disciplines known by others, let us more carefully examine why this is so. It should be noted that  -->

We arrive at knowledge of things by two paths:

1. Experience
2. Deduction

The experiences of things are often deceptive, while deduction or pure inference can be omitted if it is not necessary.

 <!-- from one thing to another may indeed be , but it  -->

But deduction is never done wrongly by an intellect, even a minimal rational one.

The Dialecticians use chains to control human reason. They are useless for this end, even if they are useful elsewhere. 

 <!-- that can happen to humans, I say, not to beasts, -->
Every human deception never arises from a bad inference. It can only arise from the fact that certain experiments are assumed little understood or judgments are rashly and without foundation established.

This is why Arithmetic and Geometry are much more certain than other disciplines.

These alone revolve around an object so pure and simple that they assume nothing that experience has made uncertain.

<!-- , but they consist entirely in reasonably deducing consequences.  -->

<!-- Therefore, they are the most easy and perspicuous of all, and they have the object we require, since it scarcely seems human to fall into error in them without inattention. 

Nor, however, should it therefore be surprising if many people are more inclined of their own accord to apply themselves to other arts or Philosophy: this happens because everyone gives himself more confidently the license to guess in an obscure matter than in one that is evident, and it is far easier to suspect something about any question than to arrive at the truth in one that is very easy. -->

This does not mean that only Arithmetic and Geometry should be learned. 

It means that in our search for the truth, we should have the same certainty as from Arithmetic and Geometric demonstrations.

<!-- only seeking the straight path of truth should we occupy ourselves with no object about which we cannot have the  -->
