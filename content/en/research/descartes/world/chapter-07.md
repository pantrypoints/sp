How could Nature untangle the confusion of the chaos after creation? What are the laws of nature that God has imposed on her?

"Nature" here does not mean some deity or imaginary power. "Nature" here means the aether itself, having the all the qualities that I have attributed to it, with the assumption that God continues to preserve it in the same way that He created it.

The fact that there are many changes in the aethereal particles that are not caused by the action of God (because that action does not change) means that those changes are from nature as the aether itself. 
- It follows that God continues to preserve the aether. 
- The rules on how the changes in the aether take place I call the "Laws of Nature" 

<!-- God created the  which determine how changes take place in the universe.  -->

<!-- To understand this better, recall that, among the qualities of matter, we have supposed that its parts have had  -->

Let us recall that the particles of the aether:
- have naturally diverse motions ever since the beginning when they were created, 
- touch one another on all sides, without any void in between
- collide with each other when they move. 

Thus, God preserves them thereafter in the same way that He created them. i.e. God always acts in the same way. 
- He does not preserve them in the same state.
- But many differences occur in the effects, as if by accident 

Among these Laws of Nature are 3 rules of motion.  

<!-- . Whence it follows of necessity that from then on, in beginning to move, they also began to change and diversify their motions by colliding with one another. Thus, if God  That is to say, with  and consequently always producing the same effect in substance, there occur, as by accident, many diversities in that effect. And it is easy to believe that God, who, as everyone must know, is immutable, always acts in the same way. Without, however, involving myself any further in these metaphysical considerations, I will set out here two or three of the principal rules according to which one must think God to cause the nature of this new world to act and which will suffice, I believe, for you to know all the others.[31] -->

## Rule 1: State Continuity

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule1.jpg" a="No Void" >}}

Rule 1: A particle always continues in the same state unless a collision with others causes it to change that state.

- if a part has some size, it will become smaller only if others divide it.
- if it is round or square, it will only change that shape if others force it to do so
- if it is stopped in some place, it will only depart from that place if others chase it away
- if it begins to move, it will always continue with an equal force to move until others stop or retard it

This rule applies both in the aethereal world and in our own real world. 

<!-- in the old world --> 
<!-- with respect to size, shape, rest, and a thousand other like things.  -->

But the philosophers have exempted motion from it. But motion is exactly what I want to add, without intending to contradict them. 

However, the motion of that philosophers speak of <!--  which they speak --> is so very different from that which I am explaining.  <!-- conceive that it can easily happen that what is true of the one is not true of the other. -->

They themselves admit that the nature of their motion is very little understood. They try to explain motion as:

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="Physics, III" >}}
motus est actus entis in potentia, prout in potentia est.
{{< /q >}}

These words are so obscure that <!--  I am constrained to leave them here in their language, because --> I cannot interpret them from Latin. 

(The words "motion is the act of a being in potency, insofar as it is in potency," are no clearer* in [English].) 


{{< n n="In the philosophical motion, the potency is the possibility to be in other states. This actually matches the 1st Rule of Descartes. An example is the motion or movement from sadness to happiness. The motion can only take place if there was a potency of happiness. The act of being in that potency results in motion. Similarly, an immovable thing has no potency for movement and so has no motion." >}}



On the contrary, the motion which I speak of can be known by geometers based on <!-- themselves, who among all men studied most to conceive very distinctly the things they were considering, judged it simpler and more intelligible than --> their surfaces and lines.
- A point's motion forms a line.
- A line's motion forms a surface.<!--  a  So it appears from the fact that they explained the line by the motion of a point, and the surface by that of a line. -->

The philosophers also suppose several motions that happen without the body changing place, such as:
- "motus ad formam" or motion with respect to form
- "motus ad calorem" or motion with respect to heat
- "motus ad quantitatem" or motion with respect to quantity
- and myriad others

My 'motion', on the other hand, refers to the lines of geometers. It is the [linear, sequential] motion taken by bodies passing from one place to another, successively occupying all the spaces in between.

The philosophers:
- say that rest is nothing but the privation of motion
- give so much solidity and reality to even the smallest motion, compared to rest

 <!-- attribute to the least of these motions a being much more solid and real than they do to rest, which they say is .  -->

My 'rest' is also a quality of the aether while it remains in one place, just as motion is its quality while it is changing place.[34]

The motion explained by philosophers has a strange nature. 
- Other things have perfection and preservation as their goal.
- But the goal of the motion of philosophers is to achieve rest*, contrary to all the laws of nature
  - It means that motion strives on its own to destroy itself. 

{{< n n="This is because everything aims to be in the perfect, most stable state" >}}


By contrast, my 'motion' follows the same laws of nature, including all the qualities found in the aether. This includes qualities observed by the philosophers:
- *modos et entia rationis cum fundamento in re* (modes and beings of thought with foundation in the thing)
- *qualitates reales* (their real qualities).

These two I cannot find in the real world. 

<!--  is   than in the others -->.



## Rule 2: Motion Transfer


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rule4.jpg" a="Collisions" >}}

Rule 2: When `Body A` pushes `Body B`, `A` gives to `B` the motion that it has lost at the same time. `B` can only take as much motion from `A` that `B` absorbs from `A`.

The combination of Rule 1 and 2 is seen in `Body B` starting or stopping to move by being pushed or stopped by `Body A`. 

Why does a stone continue to move after being thrown? Why does it not continue to move always? 

This is because of air resistance. The wind whistles when the stone divides the air. If we move our hand in the air, we feel <!-- in the air a fan or some other very light and very extended body, one will even be able to feel by the weight of one's hand that --> the air impeding its motion. <!-- , far from continuing it -->

Rule 1 might persuade us that the more an opposing body can resist, the more it can stop the motion of others. But it cannot explain:
- why the stone's motion is weakened more in colliding with a soft body of middling resistance than when it collides with a harder one that resists it more 
- why, as soon as it has made a little effort against the harder one, it spontaneously turns on its heels rather than stopping 

This is solved by Rule 2. 

It teaches us that the motion of `Body A` is not retarded by a collision with `Body B` in proportion to how much `Body B` resists `Body A`, but only in proportion to:
- how much the resistance of `Body B` is surmounted, and
- how much force `Body B` receives from the motion of `Body A`, that `Body A` loses.[35]

<!-- Now, even though in most of the motions we see in the true world we cannot perceive that the bodies that begin or cease to move are pushed or stopped by some others, we do not thereby have reason to judge that these two rules are not being observed exactly.  -->

Sometimes, we are unable to see that the motion of a physical body was caused by another body. But it does not mean that Rule 1 and 2 were absent. 

It is possible that physical objects are moved by the fire-aether [as electromagnetism] or by the air-aether [as telekenisis?] since these two are always in physical objects. These 2 Elements can even transfer their agitation to the physical air or to the Earth itself without being perceived. 

<!-- Even if we cannot perceive that the bodies in the aethereal world that begin or cease to move are pushed or stopped by some others, it does not mean that these two rules are not being observed exactly. 

Those bodies can often receive their agitation from the aethereal air and fire which are always among them without being perceptible, or even from the grosser air, which also cannot be perceived. 

We also cannot perceive the agitation that is transferred, sometimes to that grosser air, and sometimes to the Earth dispersed therein. -->
<!-- They can transfer the agitation, sometimes to that grosser air and sometimes to the whole mass of the earth; dispersed therein, it also cannot be perceived. -->

<!-- But, even if all that our senses have ever experienced in the true world seemed manifestly contrary to what is contained in these two rules, the reasoning that has taught them to me seems to me so strong that I would not cease to believe myself obliged to suppose them in the aethereal world.  -->

<!-- But, even if all that our senses have ever experienced in the true world seemed manifestly contrary to what is contained in these two rules, the reasoning that has taught them to me seems to me so strong that I would not cease to believe myself obliged to suppose them in the aethereal world.  -->

Rules 1 and 2 arise alone from the fact that **God is immutable, acting always in the same way, always producing the same effect.** 
- The immutability and consistency of God is the reason why Rules 1 and 2 hold.

<!-- He placed a certain quantity of motions in all matter in general when He first created it. One must either avow that He always conserves as many of them there or not believe that He always acts in the same way. 

From that first instant, the parts of matter, in which these motions are found unequally dispersed began to retain them or to transfer them from one to another according as they had the force to do, one must of necessity think that He causes them always to continue the same thing. And that is what those two rules contain. -->
