## The Expansion of the Universe (No Big Bang)

Before God started moving the air-aether, it was the hardest and most solid body in the world. 

God then put inequality and confusion among its particles.

This caused those particles to gradually become the current air-aether, being reduced to:
- one size, and
- one moderate motion


A push from one part would cause a pushing or pulling for all the other parts.

This action or force of moving or dividing was done first in some particles of the air-aether. 

It then spread out and distributed itself in all the other particles at the same instant, as equally as it could.

However, this equality of division could not be perfect because the division could not spread in a straight line since there was no void.

The air-aether particles were all just about equal and easily divisible.
- This allowed them to form together into various circular motions.*

God initially moved them in different ways as different centers, instead of moving them from a single center.*

{{< n n="This debunks the Big Bang" >}} 


The air-aether particles were less agitated and smaller, or both, nearest to these centres than farther away. 

They all are inclined to move in a straight line.

The strongest particles were:
- the largest ones among those of the same agitation
- the most agitated ones of those of the same size

These strongest particles created the largest circles. 
- Their orbits most closely resembled straight lines.


The air-aether contained in between 3 or more of these circles were at first much less divided and less agitated than all the others. 

At the beginning, God placed every sort of inequality among these particles. 
- They had all sorts of sizes, shapes, and dispositions to move or not to move, in all ways and in all directions.

<!-- But this does not prevent them from having subsequently all been
made fairly equal, especially those that remained an equal distance from
the centres around which they were turning. 

For since some could not
move without the others moving, the more agitated had to communicate
some of their motion to those that were less so, and the larger had to break
up and divide so as to be able to pass through the same places as those that
went before them, or so that they might rise higher. -->

<!-- But that does not prevent them afterwards from having been rendered almost all fairly equal, especially those that remained an equal distance from the centers around which they were turning. -->

The air-aether revolving in orbit gradually became of the same size. 

<!-- Some could not move without the others' moving.  -->

The more agitated transferred some of their motion to those that were less agitated.

The larger had to break up and divide in order to go farther from the center and follow those ahead of them.

<!-- be able to pass through the same places as those that preceded them, or in order to rise higher.  -->

Thus, in a short time, all the particles were arranged in order. 

Each became more or less distant from the center around which it had taken its course, according as it was more or less large and agitated compared to the others.

**Size always resists the speed of motion.** 

<!-- parts -->
The particles farther from each center were smaller than the ones closer to the center. 
- Consequently, they were much more agitated.

<!-- more agitated because they were smaller than the ones near the center.[41] -->

Exactly the same is true for their shapes. 
- In the beginning, they had all sorts of shapes, with many angles and sides.
- Afterwards, collisions cause them to break the small points of their angles and dull the square edges of their sides until they had almost all been made round

Thus, the particles close the center become similar to each other, just as those that are distant become similar. [These became the air-aether].

But this does not apply to the particles that were much larger. 
- These could not be so easily divided.
- Instead these became larger with every collision.

These became the earth-aether which make up the planets and the comets.
