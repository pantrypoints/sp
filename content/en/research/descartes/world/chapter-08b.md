## Spacetime Becomes Electromagnetism

The air-aether particles that broke off from air-aether during collisions gained:
- more speed than the air-aether because they had to travel farther at the same amount of time. 
- the ability to change shape so that it could fit anywhere

**They became the fire-aether.**


These travel much faster than the air-aether because they have to travel at a more confined path at the same amount of time.  

<!-- I say that it had to acquire a much faster motion than theirs. The
reason for this is clear. For, having to go off to the side, and through very
narrow passages, out of the small spaces left between the parts as they
proceeded to collide head-on with one another, it had to traverse a very
much greater path than they had in the same time. -->

The round air-aether particles have spaces between them. These are quickly filled by the fire-aether. 


The excess fire-aether go around the air-aether and return towards the centers of those air-aether. 

This is because the air-aether already occupies all the other, more distant places. 

## The Inverse Square Law Comes From Circular Motion

At those centers, the remaining fire-aether must compose perfectly liquid and subtle round bodies [as stars]. 

This is because they incessantly turn much faster than, and in the same direction as, the air-aether particles surrounding them. 

The fire-aether particles have the force:
- to increase the agitation of those particles to which they are closest to
- in moving from the center toward the circumference, to push the parts of fire-aether in all directions, just as they push one another.

This action we perceive as light. 

<!-- We shall take one of those round bodies composed purely of the  -->
<!-- matter of the first element  -->

The round bodies of pure fire-aether are the stars. 

<!-- , of the new world I am describing to you.  -->

The air-aether that turn around those stars as stellar gravitational territories ['the heavens'].

Imagine, that:
- the points `S`, `E`, `e`, `A`, and `Z` are the centers
- all the air-aether of the gravitational territory `FFFFGG` turns around `S`
- all the air-aether of the gravitational territory `HGGH` turns around the star `e`, and so on for the others. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/fig_2-w.jpg" alt="Gravitational Territories" >}}

Thus, each star has a stellar gravitational territory.
- Since the number of stars is indefinite, so too is the number of stellar gravitational territories. 

**The firmament is the flat surface, without thickness, separating all the gravitational territories from one another.**


### Orbital Speeds

<!-- Thus, while the parts of the second element
in the neighbourhood of  have the opportunity to describe a complete
circle there about the Sun, those in the neighbourhood of , which I am
supposing to be ten times closer, not only have the opportunity to
describe ten circles, which they would do if they moved only at the same
speed, but perhaps more than thirty. 

And again, those parts towards , or
towards , which I am supposing to be two or three thousand times more
distant, can perhaps describe more than sixty circles. From this you will
realise immediately that the highest planets must move more slowly than
the lowest, that is, those closest to the Sun, and that all the planets move
together more slowly than the comets, which are nevertheless further
away. -->

The particles of the air-aether towards `F` or `G` are more agitated than those toward `K` or `L`.

This makes their speed gradually decrease from the edge of each territory to the middle place such as:
- the orbit `KK` around the `S`
- the orbit `LL` around `e`.

From there, the middle part, it then increases little by little up to the centers of the gravitational territory because of the agitation of the stars at the center. 

Thus, the comparative speeds of the air-aether around the different orbits are:

Orbit | Cartesian Speed | Actual | Verdict
--- | --- | --- | ---
Earht orbit | 10-30 units of speed | 30 km/s (Earth) | Plausible (Forgivable)
Orbit `K` | 1 unit of speed | 13 km/s (Jupiter) | Plausible (Forgivable)
Edge of the solar system | 60 Units of speed | 0.91 km/s near Pluto (Halley's Comet) | **Wrong** 

<!--  orbit `K` [of Saturn] draws there a complete circle around the `sun`.

Those towards `earth`, which is 10 times closer to the sun, can draw 10 circles (as they would do if they moved only equally fast), but perhaps more than 30.[42]

The air-aether towards `F` or towards `G`, which is 2,000-3,000 times more distant. They can perhaps draw more than 60 circles.  -->

This is why:
- the farthest planets move more slowly than those nearest to the sun
- all the planets together move more slowly than the comets, which are more distant.*


{{< n n="Here, Descartes is factually wrong about orbital speeds beyond Pluto as he says it should be faster than Earth. In fact, it is even much slower than Saturn or Jupiter. Newton actually saw this error and is why he saw Descartes' vortices theory as problematic. After comparing *The World* with *Principia Philosophia*, we see no reason why Descartes would assign a faster speed to the outer region of a solar system especially since there is likely more friction from the spacetime of contiguous star systems. It is possible he made this wrong conclusion by misjudging the speed of comets which he did not have data on" >}}




## The Sizes of the Air-Aether Particles Depend on their Location

The comparative sizes of the air-aether around the different orbits are:

Orbit | Cartesian Size | Power |  Actual | Verdict
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Near the sun | small | strongest (most agitated) | small | Correct but obvious anyway
Orbit `K` | large | ? | large | Correct but obvious anyway
Edge of the solar system | medium  | ? | Oort cloud is smallest | Possibly Wrong 


- Between the edges of `FFFFGG` and edges of the orbit `KK`, the air-aether has similar sizes, with those at the edges of `FFFFGG` being slightly smaller than those at the edges of orbit `KK` <!-- (provided that the difference of their sizes are not proportionately greater than that of their speeds) -->.
- By contrast, from orbit `K` to the `sun`, the air-aether nearest to the sun are the smallest and strongest due to their agitation.
 
**The smaller their size, the faster their speed.**
- Otherwise, if were large and fast, then they would be flung out to the edges of orbit `KK` 

<!-- they were inversely proportional, then they would go out to occupy the place of the farthest. -->

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/orbitalspeed.jpg" alt="Orbital Speeds" c="Descartes' prediction does not apply to our solar system. But it could happen in others" >}}

<!-- The difference of their sizes is proportional to their speeds.  -->
<!-- tely greater than (or at least proportionately as great as) that of their speeds.  -->

<!-- Note finally that, given the manner in which I have said the sun and the other fixed stars were formed,  -->

The sizes of the stars can be so small compared to their own territories or solar systems. 

This makes the orbits `KK`, `LL`, etc mark the edges of the agitated area of these stars which facilitates the smaller particles of the air-aether.
- These orbits can be considered as the center of those stellar gravitational territories.
