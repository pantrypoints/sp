Conversion from Aether to Matter | Some of the Spacetime Particles become Matter



The fire-aether and air-aether break up and divide as a result of collision with one another. These have the earth-aether that goes with them. 

This earth-aether has 2 kinds. 

1. Those that combine upon collision becaues of their shapes

<!--  whose shapes were so extended and were sufficiently able to prevent this to such
a degree that, when they collided with one another, it was easier for
several of them to join together, and in this way to become larger rather
than breaking up and becoming smaller;  -->

2. Those solid ones that break and shatter others. 

{{< n n="This has an efficient crystalline structure" >}}

<!-- and those which, having been the
largest and most massive of all from the very start, were well able to break
and shatter the others by striking them, but which were not in turn
broken or shattered themselves.66
 -->

The earth-aether eventually move with the same speed as the air-aether that they are traveling in. 
- If its initial motion were quicker, its collisions with them would slow it down by transferring its agitation to them. 
- If its initial motion were slower, it would be forced to go as fast as them

 <!-- collisions with them would slow it down by transferring its agitation to them.  -->
<!--  since they would not have been able to avoid pushing it when
it was in their path and they collided with it, in a short time they would
have to transfer part of their agitation to it.  -->


This is similar to how boats that float on water follow the course of the water they are in.

- The big, heavy, and bulky boats always have much more force than the water to continue their motion, even though they receive their motion solely from the water. 
- Very light bodies, such as the lumps of white scum floating along the shores during storms, have less force to continue moving.

Let 2 rapid rivers of equal force join together at some point to mix and then separate shortly afterwards.
- The massive boats of River `1` will be able to pass easily into River `2` 
- The lightest bodies will swerve away from it and will be thrown back by the force of the water towards wherever it is the least rapid.

- Massive Boat `H` will take the course A-E-G. 
- Massive Boat `I` will take the course C-E-F. 

This is unless both meet at `E` at the same time. In such a case, the larger and stronger will break the other.

By contrast, floating light bodies must be pushed by the water to take the path `A-E-B` ending at `B` where the water is not strong.

<!-- since there [at ] it takes a course along a line which is not as close to a straight one. -->

Bodies can be joined together upon meeting at `E`. 

These turn with the water that carries them, joining to compose large balls as `K` and `L`.
- `L` goes to `E`
- `K` goes to `B`

This depends on their solidity, size, and massiveness of their particles.

No matter where the particles that could not take the form of the air-aether or fire-aether may have been initially, the larger and more bulky of them soon had to take their course toward the outer circumference of the gravitational territory [heaven] that contained them.

Subsequently, they passed from one into another of these gravitational territories without ever remaining long in the same territory. 

The less massive ones, on the other hand, had each to be pushed toward the centre of the gravitational territory containing it by the course of the matter in that territory.

And given the shapes that I attributed to them, when they collided with one another they had to join together and compose large balls.
- These rotate, having a motion tempered by all the motions their individual particles, had they been separate.

So, some tend to move toward the circumference of these heavens, and others toward their centres.

Those that range toward the centre of any gravitational territory to be the planets and those that pass
across different heavens to be comets.




<!-- ## The Earth Aether -->

<!-- The parts of the aethers are very diverse. Most of them take the form of the fire-aether or the air-aether through breaking and dividing by collision with one another. -->

<!-- The aether that became the earth-aether had 2 kinds:

1. Those which had shapes so large and impeding that they joined with the particles that they collided with.

This allowed them to become larger instead of breaking up. 

2. Those which began as the most massive that they could shatter the others but not be shattered themselves.

Whether these two were initially agitated or not, they afterwards had to move with the same agitation as the air-aether that contained them.

- If they were moving faster than the air-aether, then they would necessarily push it upon colliding with it. 

In a short time, they had to transfer to the air-aether their agitation. 

- If they were not moving, they were surrounded everywhere by the air-aether. 

They necessarily had to follow the air-aether, just as boats follow the water they are in.


## Quantum Tunneling and Star Formation

Massive and solid bodies that float on water always have much more force than the water. 

This allows them to continue their motion, even though they get their motion from the water alone. An example are the largest and most heavily-laden boats. 

By contrast, the very light floating bodies, like those lumps of white scum floating along the shores during storms, have less force to continue moving.

Imagine 2 rivers that join at some point and then separate again before their waters have a chance to mix.
- Rapid, heavy boats from River `A` will will be easily able to pass into River `B`.
- Slow, light boats from River `A` will turn away from River `B` and will be thrown back by the force of the water toward the places where it is the least rapid. -->

<!-- img src="/graphics/physics/tunnel.jpg" alt="Quantum Tunneling" cap="We apply Descartes' quantum tunnel on the less massive earth-aether (hydrogen and helium) that has recently converted from the fire-aether (electromagnetism)" -->


<!-- For example, River 1 is `ABF` and River 2 is `CDG`. They come from 2 different directions and meet at `E` and then turn away from there. 

`AB` goes towards `F`. `CD` goes towards `G`.
- Boat `H` in River 1 starts from `A` towards `B` passses through `E` towards G. 
- Reciprocally, Boat `I` in River 2 starts from `C` and goes towards `F`.

If both both meet at the passage `E` at the same time, the larger and stronger boat will break the smaller and weaker. 

By contrast, lighter bodies such as leaves and feathers that float at `A` are pushed by the course of the water, not toward `E` and toward `G`, but toward `B`, where the water is less strong and rapid than at `E`. 

This is because at `B` it takes a curved path and not a straight line.  

**These light bodies, but also others heavier and more massive can join upon meeting and that, turning then with the water that bears them, several together can compose large balls such as you see at** `K` and `L`.

The more solid and larger ones with massive particles are `L`. These go toward `E`. 

The less solid and smaller ones are `K`. These go toward `B`.
