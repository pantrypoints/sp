<!-- Now, concerning these Comets, it must first be noted that there ought to be only a few of them in this new World, in comparison with the number of the heavens.
 stellar gravitational territories.  -->


There are only a few very large comets compared to the number of solar systems. 

There were many at the beginning.

But over time, they would have passed across different solar systems.
- Almost all of them would have collided with one another and broken up, so that now only the largest remain.

When comets pass from one solar system into another, they always push before them some small bit of the air-aether that they are leaving. 

They remain enveloped by it for some time until they have entered far enough within the limits of the other solar system.

Once there, they finally loose themselves from it almost all at once.

In this way, they move much more slowly when they thus tend to leave some solar system than when they enter it.


For example, the comet that takes its course along the line `WXYZ`, has already entered far within the limits of the solar system`FFFFGG`.

Nevertheless, when it is at point `W`, it still remains enveloped by the air-aether from the territory `FI` where it came from. It cannot be entirely freed of that air-aether before it is around point `X`. 

But, as soon as it has arrived at `X`, it begins to follow the course of territory `FG` and moves much faster than when it arrived. 

It continues its course from `X` towards `Z`.

Its motion slows down little by little as it approaches point `Y`. This is both from:
- the resistance of the territory `FGH` which it is entering
- there being less distance between `sun` and `X` than between `sun` and `Y`
  - This makes all the air-aether between `sun` and `X` (where the distance is smaller) move faster there
  - This is similar to how we see rivers always flow faster where their bed is narrower* and more confined than in those where it is wider and more extended.

This comet should be visible to those who live at the center of territory `FFFFGG` only during the time it takes to pass from `X` to `Y`.

Its motion should appear to viewers to be much faster, its body much greater, and its light much brighter, at the beginning of the time they see it than at the end.

The light from the comet spreads out and is distributed in all directions in the territory.

<!-- The comet  being very large (as we must suppose it to be), there can appear around it certain rays that sometimes extend in the form of a halo on all sides and sometimes gather together in the form of a tail on one side only, according to the different places from which it is viewed. 

To us, this comet lacks none of all the properties that have been observed up to now in those that have been seen in the real world, at least none of those properties that should be taken as true. -->

<!-- In order to construct a miracle that warns of the arrival of the Turks, some historians tell us that in the year 1450, the moon was eclipsed by a comet which passed below it.

The astronomers attributed it to the parallax among the planets. 

They calculated badly the refraction (which they do not know) of the heliospheres and the uncertain speed of comets, attribute to them enough , or even below them (where some wish to pull them as by force), then we are not obliged to believe them.[45]
