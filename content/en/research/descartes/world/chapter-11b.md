In the same way, the stone `R` is so opposed to the quantity (exactly equal in size) of air-aether above it. 

The stone would occupy the place of that air-aether if `R` moved farther away from center `T`.
- That air-aether would necessarily have to descend to the extent that the stone rose.

That stone would then be opposed to an equal quantity of air-aether below it. 
- That air-aether would have to rise back the closer it gets to the center `T`. 
- This would then force the stone to descend.

 <!-- eIn the same way, that Athereal Air is also so opposed to other Athereal Airs, such as the quantity of Athereal Air below it. That upper air would occupy the lower air in the case that it were to move closer to that center. -->

<!-- This is why the stone must descend when this air rises. -->


The stone has no force to rise above the air-aether in the planetary gravitational territory because:
- The stone has much more earth-aether than an equally sized air-aether has earth-aether.
  - To counterbalance this, the stone has less air-aether  
- The stone's earth-aether is less agitated by the air-aether around it. 

Instead, the air-aether around the stone has the force to make the stone fall by moving it towards the center `T`.

Thus, the small amount of air-aether in the stone is light compared to the earth-aether in the stone. 
- But when compared to pure air-aether, it is heavy

- Consequently, it contains much less of the air-aether.

<!-- The stone's earth-aether is less agitated and energized by the stellar air-aether than planetary air-aether is agitated by stellar air-aether.

This is why: -->

 
<!-- The air-aether is agitated and is energized more by its fellow air-aether than the air-aether agitates and energizes the stone made up mostly of earth-aether.
- The stone therefore should not have enough force to rise above that quantity of air-aether.  -->
<!-- matter of the heaven  -->

Thus, each part of terrestrial bodies is pressed toward `T`.

Each body is pushed differently by the surrounding air-aether according to the quantity of the earth-aether that it has.
- This push depends on the amount of air-aether beneath an earth-aether that can take its place as the earth-aether goes down. 

<!--  air-aether exactly equal to the size of the part. 

That quantity, being underneath the part, can take its place in the case that the part falls.  -->



"Homogeneous" bodies are those that act as one. Examples are physical air and water. 

This is why:
- the gravitational force of the air-aether is not noticably more in the deepest valleys than in the highest mountains. 
<!-- closer to the center of the earth the lowest of homogenous bodies is not notably more than the highest.  -->
- a man in very deep water does not feel it weigh on his back any more than if he were swimming right on top.[52]


## Why Don't We Spin Off the Earth?

Why doesn't the stone fall to the east `6` or west `7`?

<!-- The pure aether causes the stone `R` to fall toward `T` and below the air-aether surrounding it. 
- It should also cause it to go toward `6` or east, or `7` or west faster than this air-aether. 
- In this way, the stone does not fall in a straight line to the physical Earth.  -->
 <!-- as heavy bodies do on the real earth.  -->

This is because all the terrestrial parts in the circle `5678` is being pressed toward `T` by the air-aether as one mass. 

The parts of the stellar air aether have very irregular and diverse shapes.
- These must join together and compose only one mass, which is borne as a whole by the territory `ABCD`
- This is why, while the whole territory `ABCD` turns, the air-aether at `6` always remains opposite to those that are at `2` and at `F`.
- They only shift one way or the other due to physical winds or other forces.


The air-aether at `ABCD` rotates much faster than the Earth.
- But its air-aether that are caught in the pores of terrestrial bodies move just as slow as those terrestrial bodies around the center `T`
<!-- , even though those parts move much faster in many other directions, according to the disposition of these pores. -->

The air-aether pushes the stone `R` to center `T` because the air-aether tends to move away from the center with more force than the stone.
- Yet the air-aether cannot force the stone to back up toward the West or East because it moves vertically in a straight line.

<!-- The air-aether tends with more force than the stone to go toward the west in a straight line.
- However, it cannot make the stone move to the west   -->


<!-- The stellar-air-aether tends to move away from the center `T` because it travels in a straight line [in outer space]. 
- It tends to move from the West towards the East only because:
  - it travels at the same speed, and
  - it is indifferent towards being at `6` or at `7`.
- It moves a bit more in a straight line while causing the stone `R` to fall toward `T` than it does in leaving the stone at `R`. -->

<!-- But it could not move as fast towards the East if it caused the stone to move back toward the West as it could if it left the stone in its place or even if it pushed the stone before it. -->


<!-- ; but
if it caused the stone to move back towards the west it would not be able
to move as quickly towards the east as it would if it left the stone where it
was, or even if it pushed the stone in front of it. -->


<!-- matter of the heaven -->

This downward force of the air-aether on the stone `R` cannot make it fall towards the West or East. This is because it focuses all its effort to make the stone move towards `T` according to the earth-aether contained in the stone relative to the air-aether that it has. 

<!-- To make the stone move sideways, all of the  -->

 <!-- has more force to cause this stone `R` to fall towards `T` than to cause the air-aether around the stone to fall towards `T`. -->

<!-- But it still does not have more force:
- to push the stone before it from the West towards the East, nor
- to cause the stone to move faster in that direction than the planetary-air-aether. -->

<!-- This is because there is exactly as much of this stellar-aether-air acting on the stone to cause it to fall toward `T` (and using its full force to that end) as there is earth-aether in the stone.
- This means there is more earth-aether in the stone than in the air-aether of the same size. 
- This causes the stone to be pressed much more strongly toward `T` than that air-aether.  -->


The stone travels in the same speed whether towards the East or West because the stellar-air-aether around the stone applies its force both on the air-aether and earth-aether there [as a unit, regardless of lateral direction]. 

<!-- By contrast, to cause the stone to turn toward the orient, all the matter of the heaven contained in circle R acts on it and conjointly on all the terrestrial parts of the air that is contained in that same circle. 

Thus, there being no more acting on the stone than on this air, the stone should not turn faster than the air in that direction. -->


Many philosophers say that:
- if the Earth rotates then things would fall not in a straight line
- cannonballs fired towards the West should travel much farther than if pointed towards the East
- we should always feel great winds in the air and hear great noises [in the East]

This is because they do not know that the rotation of the Earth is carried by its gravitational territory.

<!--  not affected by the course of the surrounding aether. 
- They think that Earth is moved by some other force  -->


Such arguments do not affect the motions that I am describing here. 

<!-- Note how different Descartes’ response to these standard objections to the Earth’s rotational
motion is from that of Galileo in his Two Chief World Systems. Galileo invokes a kinematic principle
of relativity of motion to account for the facts that cannon balls fired to the east and to the west
have the same range and that bodies fall vertically downwards. On Galileo’s principle, motion can
be resolved into various components, and we are only aware of those in which we do not share. So,
in the case of the fall of bodies, these actually describe a parabolic path, and this is what we would
see if we were to view the motion from an inertial frame stationary with respect to the Earth’s rotation; but because we share in the rotational motion, we are not aware of this component, only of
the downward motion, and this is what we actually see. Descartes’ account appeals to no such kinematic principle: rather, he denies that the Earth is moving in a medium (the surrounding air)
which is stationary with respect to it, and asserts that the Earth carries the medium around with
it. The air through which the body falls is really moving as much as the Earth is. -->

<!--  use arguments to refute the motion of the real earth. This has no force against the motion of the earth I am describing to you.

For example, they say that if the earth moved, then:
- heavy bodies could not descend in a plumb line toward its center, but rather would have to depart from it every which way toward the heaven
- cannonballs 
- 

These and like things do not take place except when we suppose that the earth is not carried by the course of the heaven surrounding it, but that it is moved by some other force and in some other direction than that heaven.[53]
