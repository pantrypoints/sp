Bodies that revolve always tend to move away from the centers that they revolve from. But what direction do the stars and heavens tend towards?


A body that 'tends' towards some direction does not mean that there is a thought or desire inside the body that carries it there. Instead, it means that:

- It is **disposed** to move there and
- There is something **preventing** it.*

{{< n n="Here, Descartes must emphasize resistance because his system has no void." >}}


'Tend' here means that the body is doing an effort to counteract such a resistance. 

**The body thus tends towards different directions at the same time** *


{{< n n="In Superphysics, where the body actually goes is determined by a combination of the Probability Layer and the Aethereal Layer, where the latter is the layer of causes and the former is the layer of permission (for those causes to actually exist and be generated)." >}}
 

There are often diverse causes that act together on the same body. 
- These impede each other's effect.
- The same body can be thought of as tending in different directions at the same time. 


The particles of the Earth tend to move away from its center when they are separated from the Earth.

When they are separated, they can be heavier or lighter. 

- They move towards the center when they are heavier. They are pushed towards the center by the external air-aether.
- They move away from the center if they are lighter. [They go with the air aether going out of the Earth]

<!-- This lets them  considered as opposed to other terrestrial parts that compose more massive bodies -->


Gravity is caused by the air-aether particles. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sling.jpg" a="Gravity sling" >}}


The air-aether at `A` will tend towards `G` if it:
- went with the rotation of the earth
- had no opposition from the air-aether above it.*

{{< n n="This is energy bound and then released, going in a straight line" >}}


The air-aether at `A` will tend towards `F` if it:
- went with the rotation of the earth
- was opposed by the air-aether above it at `Y`.*

{{< n n="This is centrifugal force caused by confinement" >}}


The air-aether at `A` will tend towards `E` if it:
- did not go with the rotation of the earth
  - This makes it go staight to `E` instead of going to `H` or `I`
- had no opposition from the air-aether above it.*

{{< n n="This is straight line movement without confinement" >}}


The air-aether [invisible spacetime particles] should be thought of as being the same as this stone `R`.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/moonwith.jpg" cap="In Cartesian Physics, the revolution of invisible spacetime particles around the Earth causes the tides and its oblate spheroid shape" alt="The gravitational territory of the Earth" >}}

Those that are at `E` tend of their own inclination towards `P`*.

{{< n n="This is flying off from the spin of the Earth" >}}
<!-- Those that are at `E` tend of their own inclination toward `P`. -->

<!-- ![Black Holes](/graphics/physics/world-13fff.jpg) -->

But the resistance of the other air-aether particles above them cause them to move along the circle `ER`.*

{{< n n="This is geosynchronous orbit and/or staying on the Earth" >}}

  <!-- - This resistance is opposed to their inclination to move in a straight line.  -->
- This resistance when alone would make them move towards `M` which is the near the center `T`.*

{{< n n="This was explained in Chapter 11" >}}


This is how they go towards the places that are directly opposite the center `T` of their gravitational territory.

<!-- This resistance in turn is opposed to the inclination that they have to continue
their motion in a straight line – that is, is the reason why they strive
to move – toward . And so, accounting for the others in the same
way, you can see in what sense one can say that they tend toward the
places that are directly opposite the centre of the heaven that they

compose -->
