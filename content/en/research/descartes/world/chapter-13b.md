## Solar Wind: How Do They Radiate from the Sun? 

The stellar air-aether [invisible spacetime particles] is continually pushed by 2 phenomena:

1. By their fellow air-aether between them and the star at the center of their gravitational territory 
2. By the fire-aether [visible electromagnetic particles] of that star*.


{{< n n="This is solar wind since it has a pushing force or energy" >}}


They are not pushed at all by the others [beside them].

For example, those at `E` are not pushed by those at `M`, `G`, `F`, `K`, or `H`, but only by all those that are between the two lines `AF` and `DG` together with the fire-aether of the sun.

That is why they tend not only towards `M`, but also towards:
- `L`,
- `N`, and
- generally all the air-aether that are in a straight line from the points on the sun.

  <!-- which the rays or straight lines, coming from some part of the sun and passing through the place where the parts are.* -->

<!-- > *Translator's Note: We should modify the diagram here. `E` is a point, the apex of the visual cone `EAD`. By taking a neighborhood of points about `E`, Descartes generates a space, which he also calls `E`. The light coming to that space is the light contained in all the visual cones having a vertex in the space and a base in the sun, i.e. it is the light contained in the truncated cone FADG, where F and G should lie at the upper corners of the space, as shown in the following figure The whole argument seems motivated solely by the need to have a person's eye at E see the whole disk of the sun. -->

To explain this outward motion, let us imagine the sun as a void.  


## Black Holes

Imagine the air-aether particles at `E` were all alone and that there was absolutely no light (fire-aether) anywhere, even where the sun is.

1. If that air-aether at `E` disappeared, then the air-aether beyond circle `FEG`, say at `M`, will not fill its place since it tends to move away from it.

2. The air-aether at `F` will also not fill it. This is because it is moving towards `G` with the same speed as it goes to `R`.

The void at `E` will move with them as long as others do not come from elsewhere to fill it. 

3. The air-aether within the circle `FEG` but beyond the lines `AF` and `DG`, such as those at `H` and `K`, will also not fill it.
- This is even if their tendency to move away from `S` disposes them in some way. This is similar to how a rock's weight disposes it to fall in a straight line and roll down a mountain sideways if it cannot fall straight down. 

**But such air-aether do not fill that void because of the continuous straight-line motions.**

<!-- We know that a body is being pushed by other bodies when we see them actually advancing toward the place where it is in order to fill the place in the case that it is void. -->
<!-- [56] -->

<!-- Imagine that the parts of the aethereal air -->
 <!-- second element --> 
<!-- at `E` are removed from it and, having posited that, to note in the first place that none of 


Then note in the second place also that those in that circle, to wit, at T are no more disposed to do so; for, even though they really move from T toward G along the course of the whole heaven, nevertheless, because those at `F` also move with the same speed toward `R`, the space `E` (which one must imagine to be mobile like them) will not fail to remain void between G and F,  -->

<!-- Those that are below that circle but that are not contained between the lines `AF` and `DG` (such as those at `H` and `K`) also do not move in any way towards space `E` to fill it, even though the inclination they have to move away from point `S` disposes them in some way to do so (as the weight of a stone disposes it, not only to descend along a straight line in the free air, but also to roll sideways on the slope of a mountain in the case that it cannot descend any other way).	 -->

Nature always chooses the shortest way to arrive at the same effect.[57] 
- This is why the air-aether must travel in a straight line.
- The continual straight-line motions impedes the air-aether from going into `E`. 
<!-- that space. -->


If the air-aether at `K` advanced towards `E` and filled it, then the air-aether at the Sun `S` would take the place of `K`.
- But this would create a new void at the circumference `ABCD` of the sun at the same time
<!-- fill in that place  advance at the same instant towards the place which they were leaving. -->

<!-- Hence, the effect of their motion would be only that space `E` would be filled.
- There would be another of equal size in  that would become void .  -->

But shortest way would be for the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` advance straightaway towards `E`.
- But by the time that air-aether reaches `E`, `E` has moved away.
- It cannot curve to chase `E` in the same way that a falling rock falls straight down and not in a curve.  

<!-- - Consequently, when there is nothing impeding the air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` from filling `E`, the others do not tend at all towards `E`, no more than a stone ever tends to fall obliquely toward the center of the earth when it can fall in a straight line. -->



The air-aether between the lines `AF` and `DG` must advance together towards space `E` in order to fill it when it becomes void.

Only their inclination to move away from point `S` carries them toward `E`.
- This inclination causes those between the lines `BF` and `CG` to tend to move more directly towards `E` than those that remain between the lines `AF` and `BF`, and `DG` and `CG`.
- These latter parts are also disposed as the others to go there.

The effect is that:
- **space `E` is filled**
- **a space of equal size in the circumference `ABCD` becomes void at the same time**

The air-aethers are completely alike, but not all equal.
- It does not matter which of them fill these places.
- The motions that can cause them to be unequal are irrelevant.

<!-- For, as regards the change of position they undergo in the other places that they were previously filling and that still remain full of them afterwards, it is not at all considerable, in as much as they must be supposed to be so equal and so completely like one another that it does not matter by which parts each of these places is filled.

But this does not mean that they are all equal. It means merely that the motions of which their inequality can be the cause are not pertinent to the action of which we are speaking. -->


The shortest way to fill `E` is for the air-aether at `D` to go to `E` via lines `DG` or `DE`. 

<!-- There is no shorter way of causing one part `E` of space to be filled while another, for example at `D`, becomes void than if all the parts of matter on the straight line `DG`, or `DE`, advance together toward `E`.  -->

If the air-aethers between the lines `BF` and `CF` advanced first towards `E`, then they would cause `V` to be void. 
- `D` would then have to fill this.
  - This would create a curved line `DVE`* just to fill `E` instead of a straight line `DG`, or `DE`.
- This is contrary to my rules of motion.

 <!-- another space below them at `V`, into which those which are at `D` had to come.  -->

<!-- Thus, the same effect that can be produced by the motion of the matter in the straight line , would be made by the motion of that in the .  -->
