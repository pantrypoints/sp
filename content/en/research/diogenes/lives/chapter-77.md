<sup>1</sup> Theophrastus was:
- a native of Eresus
- the son of Melantas, a fuller, as we are told by Athenodorus in the eighth book of his Philosophical Conversations.

<sup>2</sup> He was originally a pupil of Leucippus, his fellow citizen, in his own country.

After having attended the lectures of Plato, he went over to Aristotle.

When he withdrew to Chalcis, he succeeded him as president of his school, in the 114th olympiad.


<sup>3</sup> A slave of his, named Pomphylus, was a philosopher, as we are told by Myronianus of Amastra, in the first book of Similar Historical Chapters.


<sup>4</sup> Theophrastus was a man of great acuteness and industry, and, as Pamphila asserts in the thirty-second book of her Commentaries, he was the tutor of Menander, the comic poet. He was also a most benevolent man, and very affable.


<sup>5</sup> Accordingly Cassander received him as a friend.

Ptolemy sent to invite him to his court. And he was thought so very highly of at Athens, that when Agonides ventured to[195] impeach him on a charge of impiety, he was very nearly fined for his hardihood. 

There thronged to his school a crowd of disciples to the number of two thousand. In his letter to Phanias, the Peripatetic, among other subjects he speaks of the court of justice in the following terms:

“It is not only out of the question to find an assembly (πανήγυρις), but it is not easy to find even a company (συνέδριον) such as one would like; but yet recitations produce corrections of the judgment. And my age does not allow me to put off everything and to feel indifference on such a subject.” 

<!-- In this letter he speaks of himself as one who devotes his whole leisure to learning. -->

Though he was of this disposition, he nevertheless went away for a short time, both he and all the rest of the philosophers, in consequence of Sophocles, the son of Amphiclides, having brought forward and carried a law that no one of the philosophers should preside over a school unless the council and the people had passed a resolution to sanction their doing so; if they did, death was to be the penalty.

But they returned again the next year, when Philion had impeached Sophocles for illegal conduct; when the Athenians abrogated his law, and fined Sophocles five talents, and voted that the philosophers should have leave to return, that Theophrastus might return and preside over his school as before.


<sup>6</sup> His name had originally been Tyrtamus, but Aristotle changed it to Theophrastus, from the divine character of his eloquence.


<sup>7</sup> He is said also to have been very much attached to Aristotle’s son, Nicomachus, although he was his master; at least, this is stated by Aristippus in the fourth book of his treatise on the Ancient Luxury.


<sup>8</sup> Aristotle used the same expression about him and Callisthenes, which Plato employed about Xenocrates and Aristotle himself.

For he is reported to have said, since Theophrastus was a man of extraordinary acuteness, who could both comprehend and explain everything, and as the other was somewhat slow in his natural character, that Theophrastus required a bridle, and Callisthenes a spur.


<sup>9</sup> He had a garden of his own after the death of Aristotle, by the assistance of Demetrius Phalereus, who was an intimate friend of his.

<sup>10</sup> He used to say that it was better to trust to a horse without a bridle than to a discourse without arrangement. 

And once, when a man preserved a strict silence during the whole of a banquet, he said to him, “If you are an ignorant man, you are acting wisely; but if you have had any education, you are behaving like a fool.” 

A very favourite expression of his was, that time was the most valuable thing that a man could spend.


<sup>11</sup> He died when he was of a great age, having lived eighty-five years, when he had only rested from his labours a short time. 

We have composed the following epigram on him:

The proverb then is not completely false,
That wisdom’s bow unbent is quickly broken;
While Theophrastus laboured, he kept sound,
When he relaxed, he lost his strength and died.


When dying, he was asked by his disciples whether he had any charge to give them.

He replied, that he had none but that they should “remember that life holds out many pleasing deceits to us by the vanity of glory; for that when we are beginning to live, then we are dying. There is, therefore, nothing more profitless than ambition. 

But may you all be fortunate, and either abandon philosophy (for it is a great labour), or else cling to it diligently, for then the credit of it is great; but the vanities of life exceed the advantage of it.

However, it is not requisite for me now to advise you what you should do; but do you yourselves consider what line of conduct to adopt.” 

When he had said this, as report goes, he expired. And the Athenians accompanied him to the grave, on foot, with the whole population of the city, as it is related, honouring the man greatly.


<sup>12</sup> But Phavorinus says, that when he was very old he used to go about in a litter; and that Hermippus states this, quoting Arcesilaus, the Pitanæan, and the account which he sent to Lacydes of Cyrene.

<sup>14</sup> I have found his will:


{{< box >}}
I give everything that I have in my house to Melantes and Pancreon, the sons of Leon.

My things from Hipparchus I dispose of in the following manner:

- everything about the Museum[49] and the statue of the goddesses should be made perfect
- the statue of Aristotle should be placed in the temple
- the colonnade which used to be near the Museum should be rebuilt
- the tablets which have the maps of the earth should be in the lower colonnade
- an altar should be finished
- a statue of Nicomachus, of equal size, should be erected at the same time
  - the price for making the statue has been already paid to Praxiteles
  - he is to contribute what is lacking
  - it shall be placed wherever it shall seem best

My estate at Stagira I give to Callinus.

All my books I bequeath to Neleus.

My garden, and my promenade, and my houses which join the garden, I give to any of the friends I set down below if they hold a school in them and devote themselves to philosophy.

A person does not always travel. These shuold not be alienated and not be made private property.

They are to use them in common as if they were sacred ground, sharing them with one another in a kindred and friendly spirit, as is reasonable and just. 

Those who are to have this joint property are Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes, Melantes, Pancreon, and Nicippus. 

Aristotle, the son of Metrodorus and Pythias, shall also be entitled to a share in this property, if he like to join these men in the study of philosophy.

I beg the older men to pay great attention to his education that he may be led on to philosophy as much as possible. 

I want to be buried in the garden, incurring no superfluous expense about my funeral or monument. 

After the proper honours have been paid to me, and after provision has been made for the execution of my will as far as relates to the temple, and the monument, and the garden, and the promenade, then I enjoin that Pamphylus, who dwells in the garden, shall keep it and everything else in the condition as it has been in hitherto. 

Those who are in possession of these things are to take care of his interests. I further bequeath to Pamphylus and Threptes, who have been some time emancipated, and who have been of great service to me, besides all that they have previously received from me, and all that they may have earned for themselves, and all that I have provided for being given them by Hipparchus, two thousand drachmas, and I enjoin that they should have them in firm and secure possession, as I have often said to them, and to Melantes and Pancreon, and they have agreed to provide for this my will taking effect. I also give them the little handmaid Somatale; and of my slaves, I ratify the emancipation of Molon, and Cimon, and Parmenon which I have already given them. 

I hereby give their liberty to Manes and Callias, who have remained four years in the garden, and have worked in it, and have conducted themselves in an unimpeachable manner. 

Pamphylus should have as much of my household furniture as proper, and shall sell the rest.

I give Carion to Demotimus, and Donax to Neleus. I order Eubius to be sold, and I request Hipparchus to give Callinus three thousand drachmas. And if I had not seen the great service that Hipparchus has been to me in former times, and the embarrassed state of his affairs at present, I should have associated Melantes and Pancreon with him in these gifts. But as I see that it would not be easy for them to arrange to manage the property together, I have thought it likely to be more advantageous for them to receive a fixed[202] sum from Hipparchus. Therefore, let Hipparchus pay to Melantes and to Pancreon a talent a-piece; and let him also pay to my executors the money necessary for the expenses which I have here set down in my will, as it shall require to be expended.

When he has done this, then I will that he shall be discharged of all debts due from him to me or to my estate. And if any profit shall accrue to him in Chalcis, from property belonging to me, it shall be all his own. 

My executors shall be Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus, Callisthenes, and Ctesarchus.
