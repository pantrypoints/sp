### The Question Of Relativity

The questionable nature of Relativty is in it replacing the basics of philosophical and physical thought from a mere hypothesis to explain certain experimental results, even if that hypothesis is not even the only possible one.

The probability of a hypothesis is calculated in a multiplicative way from the probability of the
explanatory value and the preceding probability ; the former may be large here, but the latter is
minimal.

Relativity makes the space-time continuum of a system one-sidedly dependent on the relative motion.

If the relative velocity of a system changes, the measurement results available from it also change, which Relativity explains by actually changing the space-time of this system.

The space-time values of a system are thus generated by the relative motion ; since, however, the relative movement itself must be defined in a space-time, which in turn is again caused by relative movement should, etc., a regr[ession] in infin[ity]. 

Relativity therefore harbours ontological impossibility.

If one replies that Relativity only wants to be an expedient drawing system without ontological claims, the view of theory as fiction is thus admitted to the opponent of Relativity. There is nothing to be said against this, but the non-positivist, who believes in a physical reality, must then remain free to push the finality of Relativity.

### My Main Objections Against The Relativity Theoristics

1. The clear term "The one empirical reality" or "nature" is missing, which is inevitably in one time. 

It does not matter whether nature is conceived as a "appearance" or in the sense of realism 

2. It is overlooked that there is a set of absolutely binding statements ("real ontology") for nature


3. It is overlooked that so-called metageometry is not a "geometry" at all, but only a chapter from
pure relations theory (1.c. p. 62 ff.), which is clearly not fulfilled.

4. It is overlooked that time is fundamentally different from space (1.c p. 43).5. That "at the same time" should be many "times" is an unenforceable thought (1.c p. 41),

6. The idea that movement, which is supposed to be only relative, has an absolute real effect (scale
reduction, clock example; 1.c s. 21, 25, 26).

7. It is a credit to Einstein to have shown that today there is no means of precisely determining
simultaneity. 

But a limit of determinability is not a limit of ideal gratitude; and limits of practical determinability must never be used to create logically absurd constructions.

8. Relatvity only deals with the practical scientific operation of mathematical physics, which
encounters certain obstacles; but it has no ideological significance at all.
