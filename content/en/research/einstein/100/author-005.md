5. ### Armin Gimmerthal / Bonn: Relativity Is Fake

Speed | 1

I prove in a recent work "Four Relations Clauses and one Relations System, a Complete Refutation of
Relativity" :

1. Relativity  is in contradiction with incontrovertible laws of thought, in particular the
principle of addition and the principle of relativity of classical mechanics;

2. Relativity is a falsification of it and that he has had to make it in order to be able to make his claims

3. All transformation equations intended to support these claims are false;

4. Einstein's views on space and time are untenable, in particular, that he lacks the appropriate ideas for the concept of simultaneity

5. Relativizing simultaneity is an obvious nonsense

6. The Minkowski's "world" — a mathematical fantasy of this is in turn a forgery, and7. that the correctly understood mathematics of theory fully confirms all these accusations.


### 6. Dr. Ludwig Gold Schmidt: Ignorance And Arbitrariness

My work refutes Einstein's assertions.

His Relativity:
- understands nothing of the relativity of sensual knowledge and
- does not deserve the name of a "theory". 

Everything that can be peeled out as correct in the remarks of Einstein and his proclaimer Weyl is partly ancient.

What could be described as new is a mistake that was predicted by me years ago and, as my writing shows, by Kant.

Einstein and Weyl operate in an area for which precise and reliable philosophical knowledge must be assumed. 

Their ignorance, however, is only exceeded by the grotesque inflation of a self-consciousness that can be characterized by the following words: Everything Einstein does not understand, because understanding requires knowledge that he lacks, "is without meaning and dark."

To really understand the error of their speculations, Einstein and Weyl will need several years of study.



### 7. Professor Dr. A. H. De Hartog / Amsterdam: Philosophic Backgrounds

Many believe that through his theory:
- everything has become "relative"
- nothing is fixed any more

1. If the temporal orientation may change from a subjective point of view, it is not yet said that time cannot therefore be a "form of existence" in objective reality (see, inter alia, Ed. von Hartmann's transcendental realism). 

The subjective orientation in the midst of the temporal event may be relative, but objectively there may nevertheless be a temporal constellation at the same time, which is not readily compatible with the sub- orientation stands and falls.


2. Although the subjective orientation in the temporal events would turn out to be relative, the arithmetical and geometric numbers and formulas with which the subjective-relative orientations are calculated remain constant as such, as arithmetic and
mathematical data, under which one use the relative temporal orientation.

3. If relativism were to be mentioned here, this relativism, in the midst of Relativity itself, is to be understood only physically, i.e. solely in relation to the natural, material events.

But this natural, material, physical event exceeds the aesthetic, ethical, philosophical and religious values, which do not stand or fall with a potentially physical event. Because the above values show up as a "duty", "idea" "Ideal" etc. about -natural, even anti-natural. 

The evaluation of these values is therefore not physical, but a metaphysical one.

4. Although these values should be relative, the human spirit nevertheless refers all, even these relative values, to the absolute, to the thought, the spirit, god or whatever word one may choose, in order to mean that unity is in- the midst of the multiplicity of science, wisdom and religion.

5. Einstein's assertion of a finite universe is very suitable for making scientific, philosophical, and theological discussions about the spirit transcendent beyond this universe.
