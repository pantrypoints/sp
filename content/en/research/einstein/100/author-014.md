### Professor Dr. P. F. Linke / Jena: Relativity Theory And Psychological Time

My opposition to Relativity begins as soon as it believes it can make philosophical and ideological statements.

No physicist can be prevented from building his science into a positivistic-instrumentalistic system of knowledge.

He can say that physical propositions are "true" if it is possible with their help to calculate other phenomena and predict them correctly.

<!-- on the basis
of observation of certain phenomena and accordingly "predict"  -->

In the building of a physics in this way, Relativity fits in casually and also provides haunting evidence of its feasibility.

The task of research is the establishment of the truth.

The only question is whether this feasibility was achieved at the expense of the truth. 

 <!-- which has hitherto been regarded as its most valuable, indeed as its real and, as far as questions of worldview are concerned, decisive. -->

Because “truth” of positivistic physics is fundamentally different from the truth in Nature. 

<!-- what the natural human being understands by truth and has a right to understand. -->

- The real truth always refers to an existing being.
- The positivistic "truth" is just a mere instrument for calculating the phenomena. 
  - Therefore, it tolerates false principles, even contradicting real truth.

<!-- : it reveals itself as a - - in the broader
sense a technical matter of peripheral knowledge, world view problems are irrelevant: because the
nature of the matter can only be served with genuine truth. - -->

### Logical Difficulties

It is an open secret that thinking about the categorical foundations of Relativity actually leads to logical difficulties. 

<!-- One of these difficulties, which is often overlooked precisely
because it is one of the most elementary requirements of the theory in question, is briefly outlined
here. -->

R. Weinmann pointed out that Einstein already assumed simultaneity in his physical definition of simultaneity:

{{< q >}}
"Two distant light signals, A and B, are for him at the same time when they" meet "in the middle M - namely (what else could this mean?) Meet at the same time" 1).
{{< /q >}}

One will reply: 


{{< q >}}
Einstein's definition naturally only concerns the simultaneity of events in different places. It alone is in question. The simultaneity of two events in the same places (or at two immediately adjacent) are completely unproblematic.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- 1) "The untenability of the special RTH" (Nature and Culture, Issue 4). Tyrolia, Innsbruck-Vienna-
Munich 1930. -->

But is that the case? 

Simultaneity presupposes time and since according to Relativity there are several equal times. 

In the sense of which time is there simultaneity?

**Hugo Bergmann follows Bergson and answers that here psychological time protrudes into physics.**

In fact, when the physicist makes time determinations, he is always compelled to determine directly experienced simultaneities (namely that of the physical event to be investigated with the pointer of his clock).

Thus, he immediately includes time experienced in its results.*

{{< n n="This was earlier explained by Poincare in his *Measure of Time*" >}}

Bergmann recognizes it as a contradiction: 

{{< q a="Bergmann" >}}
physics is not able to completely exclude psychological time from its conceptual structure, but is also not able to cope with it with its concepts.. "the world of physics is a world of abstraction. Physics should carry that abstraction purely within its conceptual means ”
{{< /q >}}
<!-- Of course, this should not say anything essential against the categorical structure of
modern physics (and therefore also of Relativity), because - as it goes on -  -->


That is certainly correct.

**But an abstraction that introduces contradictions into the abstraction result which are not present in what is being abstracted from is strange.** *

{{< n n="In other words, physical time is objective, but mental time is subjective" >}}



<!-- that -->
I can abstract the concept of furniture from the concepts of tables, chairs, benches, cupboards and beds.

My abstraction would be flawed if it contradicted with the concept of furniture.

**However above all, there is no psychological time at all in the Bergsonian sense presupposed here (as something coordinated with physical time).**

<!-- The so-called  -->

His psychological time is rather **the experience of time** as opposed to time itself.
- His time is time grasped in experience, more or less modified by conception.

At the moment, it is related to itself as the number perceived by us in the immediate experience (e.g. a point group) as related to the actual number.

To speak of a psychological time in any other than this entirely secondary sense is as wrong as to speak of a psychological number.

For example, if 125 actually-perceived points are estimated at 60 mental-points, then it is a special psychological Number of 60 points.*

{{< n n="*Relativity allows anyone to make up their own abstractions without matching reality" >}}


If there is no particular psychological time, then it cannot be used to remove the logical inconsistency which we have uncovered above.
- Rather, it remains unchanged as such.

2) a. a. 0., p. 404. -->

By the way: from an actual one.

Eliminating the discrepancy in question is also out of the question for Bergmann. What he is doing is merely to soften it, to push it onto a dead track.

But it is also there for him. Such a staunch advocate of Relativity as Hugo Bergmann recognized and emphasized one of its most fundamental weaknesses.
