I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist, L. Boltzmann. 

<!-- Theory of the Specific Heat of Solid Bodies, and the
fundamental idea of the General Theory of Relativity.
During the interval 1909 to 1911 Einstein occupied the post of Professor Extraordinarius at the University of Zurich, afterwards being appointed to the University of Prague, Bohemia, where he remained as Professor Ordinarius until 1912. In the latter year Professor Einstein accepted a similar chair at the Polytechnikum, Zurich, and continued his activities there until 1914, when he received a call to the Prussian Academy of Science, Berlin, as successor to Van’t Hoff.

Professor Einstein is able to devote himself
freely to his studies at the Berlin Academy, and
it was here that he succeeded in completing his
work on the General Theory of Relativity (1915–
17). Professor Einstein also lectures on various
special branches of physics at the University of
Berlin, and, in addition, he is Director of the
Institute * for Physical Research of the Kaiser
Wilhelm Gesellschaft.
Professor Einstein has been twice married.
His first wife, whom he married at Berne in 1903,
was a fellow-student from Serbia. There were
two sons of this marriage, both of whom are liv-
ing in Zurich, the elder being sixteen years of age.
Recently Professor Einstein married a widowed
cousin, with whom he is now living in Berlin.

IN presenting this translation to the English-
reading public, it is hardly necessary for me
to enlarge on the Author’s prefatory remarks,
except to draw attention to those additions to the
book which do not appear in the original.
At my request, Professor Einstein kindly sup-
plied me with a portrait of himself, by one of
Germany’s most celebrated artists. Appendix III,
on “The Experimental Confirmation of the Gen-
eral Theory of Relativity,” has been written
specially for this translation. Apart from these
valuable additions to the book, I have included
a biographical note on the Author, and, at the
end of the book, an Index and a list of English
references to the subject. This list, which is
more suggestive than exhaustive, is intended as
a guide to those readers who wish to pursue the
subject farther.

of the Imperial College, for their kindness in
reading through the manuscript, for helpful
criticism, and for numerous suggestions. I owe
an expression of thanks also to Messrs. Methuen
for their ready counsel and advice, and for the
care they have bestowed on the work during the
course of its publication. -->


We were taught that Euclid’s geometry is true. But are we really sure?

Geometry has concepts like:
- “plane”
- “point”
- “straight line”

These lead to axioms which we are inclined to accept as “true.” 

From this, all the remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. 

A proposition is then correct (“true”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. 

The question of the “truth” of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the “truth” of the axioms. 

**But his is actually unanswerable by the methods of geometry. It is also in itself entirely without meaning.** *


{{< n n="This is because Euclid's Elements are about the nature of the Five Elements (Strong Force, Weak Force, Electromagnetism, Spacetime, Aether) represented in lines and shapes. It is not about shapes." >}}


We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points*. 

{{< n n="Einstein here is talking about Postulate 1. We assert that Postulate 1 is about the aethereal link between two identities. This is essential in Kepler's theory of gravity which is made up of invisible chains between objects. Postulate 1 means that there is **ONLY** 1 link between to identities." >}}


We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called “straight lines.” These lines have the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it.


The concept “true”* does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word “true” we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a “real” object.

{{< n n="The truth of Postulate 1 is proven by cutting or manipulating that single aethereal link in order to change the weight or  gravity of a body. This is already done by zipping UFOs, and by levitating Buddhist monks (from whom we got our Elastic Theory of Gravity)." >}}



## Our Perceptions are Relative and Dynamic and Not Absolute and Static

Geometry*, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves.

{{< n n="Euclid's Geometry is about the Metaphysics of physical phenomena. These are drawn in simple relations, as lines, curves, and shapes. It is not about Physics nor physical shapes." >}}



This is why we *feel* constrained to call the propositions of geometry “true.” 

Geometrical ideas correspond to objects in nature. This correspondence is the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas. 

**Geometry should refrain from such a course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity.** 

For example:
- we have the deep habit of seeing two marked positions on a rigid body
- we are used to regard three points on a straight line when seen with one eye. 

<!-- If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a rigid body  -->
The propositions of Euclidean geometry become relative <!--  then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative --> to the position of rigid bodies if we decree that the two points on that rigid body always correspond to the same line-interval-distance, independently of any changes in the position of that body, 

<!-- This means that a natural object is associated also with a straight line.  -->

For example, three points `A`, `B` and `C` on a rigid body lie in a straight line when:
- `A` and `C` are given
- `B` is chosen such that the sum of the distances `AB` and `BC` is as short as possible

This incomplete suggestion will suffice for our present purpose.

This kind of geometry is then to be treated as a branch of physics. **The geometry is true if it matches those real things that we associate with those geometries.** 

<!-- We can now legitimately ask as to the “truth” of geometrical propositions interpreted
in this way, since we are justified in asking whether
these propositions are satisfied for those real things
we have associated with the geometrical ideas.  -->

<!-- In less exact terms we can express this by saying
that by the “truth” of a geometrical proposition
in this sense we understand its validity for a con-
struction with ruler and compasses.

Of course the conviction of the “truth” of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded
exclusively on rather incomplete experience. 

For the present we shall assume the “truth” of the
geometrical propositions, then at a later stage
(in the general theory of relativity) we shall see that this “truth” is limited, and we shall consider the extent of its limitation. -->
