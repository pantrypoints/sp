The train is travelling with a constant velocity `v`. 

A man walks from the back of the train movig forward in the direction of travel with a velocity `w`.

How quickly, or with what velocity `W`, does the man advance relative to the embankment? 

If the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to the embankment through a distance `v` equal numerically to the train's velocity. 

As a consequence of his walking, however, he travels an additional distance `w` relative to the train. 

Hence, he is also relative to the embankment. In this second, the distance `w` is numerically equal to his walking velocity. 

Thus, in total he covers the distance `W = v + w` relative to the embankment in that second. 

This result shows the theorem of the addition of velocities in classical mechanics. **But this theorem does not hold in reality.**
