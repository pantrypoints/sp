Our experience shows that:
- the principle of relativity holds true, and
- the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant `c` 

By uniting these two postulates, we obtained:
- the law of transformation for co-ordinates `x, y, z` and
- the time `t` of the events in nature

This led to the Lorentz transformation and not the Galilei transformation of classical mechanics. **The constant speed of light played an important part in this.** Through the Lorentz transformation, we can combine this nature of light with the principle of relativity. We sum up the theory thus:

{{< q a="Einstein" >}} 
Every general law of nature* is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the spacetime variables `x, y, z, t` of the original non-moving coordinate system `K`, we introduce new space-time variables `x', y', z', t'` of a moving coordinate system `K'`. 
{{< /q >}}


{{< n n="This part of Relativity is correct. The error is in basing it in the constancy of light" >}}



The relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. In other words: **General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.**

This is a definite mathematical condition that my theory of relativity demands of a natural law. This makes my theory a valuable heuristic aid in the search for the general laws of nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved*.
