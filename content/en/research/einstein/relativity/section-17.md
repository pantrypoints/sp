<!-- 
THE non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he hears of “fourdimensional” things, by a feeling not unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult. 
 -->
Space is a 3D continuum wherein:
- an object exists in 3 co-ordinates `x, y, z` as Point 1
- there are infinite points around Point 1
  - These are designated as `x1, y1, z1`, `x2, y2, z2`, `x3, y3, z3`, etc. 
  - These points create a “continuum”

Our universe is a 4D space-time continuum, as described by Minkowski. It has the additional coordinate of time-value `t`. 

Every event has infinite “neighbouring” events (realised or imaginary). The leads to co-ordinates `x1, y1, z1, t1`<!--  of which differ by an indefinitely small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered -->. 

Before my theory of Relativity, time played a different and more independent rôle to the space co-ordinates. This is why we usually treat time as an independent continuum*.


{{< n n="The time-coordinate was not important in the past because electromagnetism was not so important in the 18th century. Even in daily life today, we rarely encounter motions that are faster than a jet or racecar as to bother about time-coordinates. Einstein is like a lobbyist for light that promotes the 4D spacetime over the 3D one" >}}


Time is absolute* in classical mechanics -- it is independent of the position and the condition of motion of the system of coordinates. This is expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation as `t' = t`. 


{{< n n="Time is absolute in classical mechanics because classical movement happened within the observable space that is within human cognitive limitations." >}}




The 4D spacetime is natural to the theory of relativity which robs time of its independence*. 

{{< n n="This is why Modern Physics is so spooked by the independent superposition of quantum mechanics. The 4D spacetime is totally opposite of Descartes' space and time which is made up of independent moments because of the arbitrariness of the aether." >}}  

<!-- In Superphysics, this is handled by the Physical and Aethereal Cartesian Plane. The Physical Cartesian Plane gives emphasis to space, while the Aethereal Cartesian Plane gives emphasis to time." -->


Time is absolute in classical mechanics because classical movement happened within the observable space that is within human cognitive limitations.


This is shown by the 4th equation of the Lorentz transformation:

``` elixir
t' = (t - (v/c2) x) / √ 1-(v2/c2)
```

The time difference `∆ t'` of two events with respect to `K'` does not vanish in general, even when the time difference `∆ t` of the same events with reference to non-moving `K` vanishes. Pure “space-distance” of two events with respect to non-moving `K` results in “time-distance” of the same events with respect to the moving `K'`. 

Minkowski's discovery was important for the development of my theory of relativity<!-- , does not lie here -->. 

The 4D space-time continuum of the theory of relativity has a pronounced relationship with the 3D continuum of Euclidean geometrical space. To emphasize this relationship, we must replace the usual time coordinate `t` by an imaginary magnitude `√ −1ct` proportional to it. This allows the natural laws that satisfy the demands of Special Relativity to assume mathematical forms wherein the time coordinate plays exactly the same rôle as the `x, y, z` coordinates. 

These 4 coordinates correspond exactly to the 3 space coordinates in Euclidean geometry. <!-- It must be clear even to the non-mathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no mean measure. -->

<!-- These inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of the important idea contributed by . --> 

Without Minkowski's 4D spacetime, General Relativity could not be developed.<!-- , of which the fundamental ideas are developed in the following pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its long clothes.  -->

<!-- Minkowski’s work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone inexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to have a very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental ideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I shall at present leave it here, and shall revert to it only towards the end of Part 2.
