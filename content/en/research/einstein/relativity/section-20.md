{{< n n="Einstein invents General Relativity by creating the idea of inertial mass which is really Newton's third law. This is why he has to say that everything is moving -- because his inertial gravity is not really gravity, but just action and reaction." >}}

<!-- Assuming empty space so far removed from stars and other appreciable masses that we have before us approximately the conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. 

It is then possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space, relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion.  -->

Assume that, in outerspace, there is a huge glass box that serves as our reference-body. 
- That box has a man inside it. 
- He floats because there is no gravity.
- In the middle of the lid of the chest, a hook is fixed externally. It has a rope attached. 

<!--  let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. -->   <!-- Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer. He must tie himself with strings to the floor. Otherwise, the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room. --> 

This rope is pulled <!-- , and now a “being” (what kind of a being is immaterial to us) begins pulling at this --> .
- This box then moves upwards through a constant force.  <!-- The chest together with the observer then begin to move “upwards” with a uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will reach unheard-of values — provided that we are viewing all this from another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope. But how does the man in the chest regard the process?  --> 

The man will feel the acceleration of the box by the reaction of the floor. 
- He must take up this pressure through his legs if he does not wish to be laid out on the floor.
- He is then standing inside the box<!--  in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a house on our earth -->.

![Box](/graphics/physics/box.jpg)

If he releases a stone in his hand, it will also go to the floor of the box <!--  body which he previously had in his hand, the acceleration of the chest will no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body will approach the floor of the chest --> with an accelerated relative motion.  

He will feel that he and the box are  <!-- The observer will further convince himself that the acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment. Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field --> <!-- (as it was discussed in the preceding section) , the man he  will thus come to the conclusion that he --> <!-- and the box are  -->in a gravitational field which is constant with regard to time. 

<!-- He will be puzzled why the box does not fall in this gravitational field. He discovers the hook and rope at the top of the box. He concludes that the box is suspended at rest in the gravitational field. -->

<!-- Should we smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?  -->

<!-- I do not believe we ought if we wish to remain consistent; we must rather
admit that  -->

<!-- His mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws. --> 

{{< c v="red" >}} Even though the box is being accelerated with respect to outer space, the box is at rest* relative to itself. This is grounds for extending the principle of relativity to General Relativity (GR)</b> to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other.{{< /c >}} 


 <!-- , and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity. --><!--  the “Galileian space” first considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. -->

![WTF](/graphics/wtf.png)

{{< n n="WTF!!! Gravity is not equivalent to the Second or Third Law of Newton! When our car moves forward and we are pushed back by inertia, we never say that there was gravity behind the car! " >}}




<!-- This is really why Einstein equated the gravitational mass with inertial mass in the previous section. The unity of gravitational and inertial mass does not support General Relativity. Instead, it is General Relativity that needs that unity! -->


## Gravitational Mass vs Inertial Mass

GR is based on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. <!-- We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of interpretation rests --> 

{{< c v="red" >}} This law is the fundamental property of the gravitational field that gives all bodies the same acceleration*.{{< /c >}}

{{< n n="We totally understand what Einstein is trying to do here: In Cartesian Physics, both gravity and electromagnetism (and therefore gravitational lensing, planetary orbits, gravitational waves, time dilation) are caused by Spacetime. Einstein tries to achieve this Spacetime effect by imposing the equality of inertial mass (electromagnetic potential) and gravitational mass (Newtonian mass). But in doing so, he puts electromagnetism as the supreme principle just as Newton put matter as supreme. " >}}

<!-- n n="G to Newton was based on gravitational mass. But G to Einstein is based on both inertia and gravitational mass which he imposes as a new law of gravity, instead of as another theory.   -->


If this natural law did not exist, the man in the moving box:
- would not be able to feel the gravity in the box<!-- interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field -->
- would not see his box to be at rest <!-- be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his reference-body to be “at rest.” -->

Because of this law, if the man hangs a rock from the box's ceiling through a rope, he will see that:
- the rope neutralizes the box's gravity through tension
- the mass of the rock determines the tension.   <!--  fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The result of this will be to stretch the rope so that it will
hang “vertically” downwards. --> 

<!-- If we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say=  “The suspended body
experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope; what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the .” On the other hand, --> 

However, an observer outside will see that the hanging rope joins the box's motion which it transmits to the rock. The rope's tension is just large enough to make the rock accelerate downards. The rock's inertial mass determines the rope's tension. 

Thus, GR <!-- Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the --> <!-- necessity --> requires the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass*. <!-- Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law. --> <!-- From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of gravitation. --> <!-- In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations.  --> A gravitational field exists for the man in the box, despite the fact that there was no such gravity in the spacetime before the box moved.


{{< n n="Yes, GR needs inertial and gravitational mass to be the same. But those masses do not need GR! They need the aether!" >}}


We might think that:
- the gravitational field is always only an apparent field
- we can change our viewpoint so that that gravitational field will not be a gravitational field anymore. 
<!-- We might also think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no gravitational field exists with reference to it.  -->

{{< c v="red" >}} But in reality, this is only true for special gravitational fields. For example, it is impossible to choose a viewpoint<!--  body of reference such that, as judged from it, --> where the earth's gravitational field totally vanishes. This solves our argument against GR at the end of Section 18.{{< /c >}}

The observer in the train jerks forwards as a result of the train braking. This shows to him the <!-- , and that he recognises in this the --> non-uniformity of motion <!-- (retardation) --> of the train. But he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a “real” acceleration <!-- (retardation) --> of the train. This is because his viewpoint in the train is at rest*. <!-- He might also interpret his experience thus=  “My body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however, there exists (during the period of application of the brakes) --> 


{{< c v="red" >}} The brakes created a gravitational field which was directed forwards and is variable with respect to time.{{< /c >}} Because of this <!-- Under the influence of this --> [fake] gravitational field, the embankment's backward movement slowed down.


{{< n n="Einstein sources gravity from the the weird idea that non-moving large masses are actually moving and that massless bodies are not moving.  " >}}
