Section 20 showed that General Relativity (GR) lets us derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical way*.


{{< n n="Yes, it's only theoretical just as Genesis is theoretical and not real!" >}}


Let us suppose that we know the space-time “course” for any path in Galileian space relative to a non-moving viewpont.

<!--  Galileian body of reference K.  --> Through <!-- purely --> theoretical <!-- operations simply by --> calculation, we can find how this path <!-- natural process --> appears, as seen from a moving viewpoint <!-- reference-body --> `K'` which is <!-- accelerated --> moving relatively to `K`. But since <!--  exists with respect to --> this new <!-- body of reference --> viewpoint `K'` has its own gravitational field, we can find out how such a field <!--  our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field --> influences the parth<!--  process studied -->.

For example, a body moving <!--  in a state of uniform rectilinear motion --> straight with respect to  `K` (according to the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and curvilinear motion with respect to the moving glass box <!-- accelerated reference-body --> `K'` in Section 20 . Its acceleration or curvature is affected by the gravitational field <!--  influence on the moving body of the gravitational field --> <!-- prevailing relatively to --> in `K'`. <!-- A gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing essentially new. -->

![Box](/graphics/physics/box.jpg)

However, we get a different result when we replace that body with <!--  obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry out the analogous consideration for --> a ray of light. 
- It travels in a straight line with the velocity `c` relative to the moving glass box.
- But its path <!-- With respect to the Galileian reference-body `K`, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly  The path of this light --> will be in a curve <!-- is no longer a straight line --> when seen from the relative to <!-- consider it with reference to --> moving glass box. <!--  accelerated chest (reference-body K').-->

**This means that generally, light curves in <!-- are propagated curvilinearly in --> gravitational fields.**
  
This is very important because:

1. This happens in reality. 

<!-- It can be compared with the reality. Although a detailed examination of the question shows that --> The curvature of light rays by gravity <!-- required by General Relativity --> is very small. Nevertheless, <!-- for  gravitational field. s at our disposal in practice, its estimated magnitude --> the curve for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence is 1.7 seconds of arc. 

<!-- This should manifest itself in the following way. -->

From the earth's viewpoint, certain fixed stars are seen around the sun during a total eclipse. These stars should then appear displaced away from the sun by 1.7 seconds of arc compared to their apparent position in the sky when the sun is elsewhere*. 



{{< f f="*Einstein Note: Through star photographs, the Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies confirmed the deflection of light demanded by GR during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919." >}}

<!-- This should be tested by astronomers.  -->
<!-- The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers. -->

2. The constant speed of light in vacuum <!-- , which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in Special Relativity and to which we have already frequently referred, --> cannot be totally<!--  unlimited -->  valid, according to GR. 

Since light rays can only curve when light changes position, <!--  the speed of light --> <!--  take place when the velocity of propagation of light --> <!-- varies with position --> one might think that this invalidates <!-- Now we might think that as a consequence of this, --> Special Relativity (SR), and with it the whole theory of relativity. But this is not the case. 

{{< c v="red" >}} It just means that <!-- We can only conclude that --> Special Relativity is not valid universally. <!-- cannot claim an unlimited domain of validity. --> Special Relativity only holds if we <!-- only so long as we are able to --> disregard the influence of gravitational fields on light<!-- the phenomena (e.g. of light) -->.{{< /c >}}


{{< c v="red" >}} Opponents of Relativity say that Special Relativity is overthrown by the General Relativity. But they are wrong.{{< /c >}}

Before the development of electrodynamics, the laws of electrostatics and the laws of electricity were regarded indiscriminately. Nowadays, we know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic considerations only when  the electrical masses are at rest relative to each other<!-- and the coordinate system -->. But we do not overthrow electrostatics because of Maxwell's field-equations.

Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case. 

The laws of electrodynamics lead directly to laws of electrostatics when the fields are invariable with regard to time*.


{{< n n="Here Einstein shows his sophistry. Electrostatics is a part of Electrodynamics just as a car being able to part (have a handbrake) is a part of the whole design for a moving car. But General Relativity is different because it is a sophistical extension of Maxwell-Lorentz onto outerspace and gravity. It is like adding wings to a car to make it into a flying car yet applying road rules in flight." >}}


{{< c v="red" >}} Special Relativity points to a more comprehensive theory in the form of General Relativity. {{< /c >}}

Through the bending of light by gravity, General Relativity enables us to theoretically derive the influence of a gravitational field on light (The laws of light we already know when gravity is absent.)
<!-- No fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case. -->

<!-- In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have seen that  -->


{{< c v="red" >}} General Relativity solves* the gravitational field itself.{{< /c >}}

![Einstein Con-man](/icons/einbla.png)

{{< n n="No, it doesn't. It actually makes gravity more confusing because it is totally different from Newton who clearly saw gravity as a force" >}}


We already know what happens to spacetime without gravity. <!--  are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately) in a “Galileian” fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. --> A gravity-less moving body <!-- If we now refer such a domain to a reference-body --> `K'` <!-- possessing any kind of motion, --> will interact with a <!-- then relative to K' there exists a --> gravitational field which is variable with respect to space and time*. The character of this field will depend on<!--  the motion chosen for --> `K'`'s motion. 


{{< f f="*Einstein note: This follows from a generalisation of Section 20." >}}


According to GR, the general law of the gravitational field applies. <!-- must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way. --> Not all gravitational fields are produced in this way [exposed by moving bodies]. 

{{< c v="red" >}} Yet we can hope that such kinds of gravitation will lead to a general law of gravitation*.{{< /c >}}

<!--  will be derivable from special kinds of gravitational fields.  -->

![Einstein Con-man](/icons/einbla.png)


{{< n n="After 100 years, no general law of gravitation has been derived from GR because his gravitation was a sophistry in the first place." >}}

<!-- This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner.  -->
