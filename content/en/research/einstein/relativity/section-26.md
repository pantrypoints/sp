We can now use Gaussian coordinates to formulate more exactly the Minkowski spacetime in Section 17. According to Special Relativity (SR), Galileian coordinate systems are preferred for describing a 4D space-time continuum.

The 4 co-ordinates `x, y, z, t` determine an event or a point of the 4D continuum. For the transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid. 

These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from SR. These in themselves are nothing but the expression of the universal constancy of the speed of light<!--  for all Galileian systems of reference -->.

Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions.

Two neighbouring events happen in the 4D continuum with respect to a Galileian reference-body `K` by the space co-ordinate differences `dx, dy, dz` and the time-difference `dt`.
- The second Galileian system has the corresponding differences for these two events as `dx', dy', dz', dt'`. 
- These magnitudes always fulfill the condition= 


``` elixir
dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 − c^2 dt^2 = dx'^2 + dy'^2 + dz'^2 − c^2 dt'^2
```


The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition, expressed as:

``` elixir
ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 − c^2 dt^2
```



The magnitude which belongs to two adjacent points of the 4D space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian) reference-bodies. If we replace `x, y, z, √ (− 1 ct)` by `x1, x2, x3, x4`, we also obtain the result:

``` elixir
ds^2 = dx1^2 + dx2^2 + dx3^2 + dx4^2*
```



This is independent of the choice of viewpoint. We call the magnitude `ds` the “distance” apart of the 2 events or 4D points. <!-- Cf. Appendices I and II. The relations which are derived there for the co-ordinates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate differences, and thus also for co-ordinate differentials (indefinitely small differences).
[ * ds 2 = dx 1 2 + dx 2 2 + dx 3 3 + dx 4 2 — J.M.]  --> Thus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable `√ (− 1 ct)` instead of the real quantity `t`, we can regard the space-time continuum — in accordance with Special Relativity — as a “Euclidean” 4D continuum<!-- , a result which follows from the considerations of the preceding section -->.
