It is of some interest to investigate the case where ... inside the cluster is constant 4u StAcrly specking eau outaide of our condiaons es ought to duce tow.d the point • • 0 et leset es lut r. in orders hat the density in the neighborhood of the center should Am finite. We een swirly Will condition by choosing n for instance (29) where c is to be an ANA, eon... 

We then corner from the start the caw e • . Thin sucial Awn is diseusud here in order to supple- the discuarions of part 4. There tbe whole mus was distributed inn  outside (within the woo radius A) u wMW hue we have • strong centration of mass toward the utter of the cluster.

For r = 0 we obtain a w and 4 • 0. 

This type of Angularity, however, is not to be taken seriously became it would be avoided if we had taken into con-sideration the exponential turn in (29).
