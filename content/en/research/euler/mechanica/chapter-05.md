THE CURVILINEAR MOTION OF FREE POINTS ACTED ON BY ABSOLUTE FORCES OF ANY KIND

DEFINITION 21.

543. A body describes the curved line AMB (Fig. 47) when acted upon by a force. The
tangential force on the body is the component of the force along the direction of the
tangent TMt to the curve at the point M.

Corollary 1.

544. Therefore the tangential force exerts no other
effect on the body while the element Mm is
traversed, except that the motion of the body is
either accelerated or retarded, since clearly the body
is pulled either following the direction of MT or Mt.

Corollary 2.

545. Therefore when a body is moving along a
curved line, the tangential force continually changes
its direction and exerts its influence at another place.

Scholium.

546. Indeed a tangential force is hardly ever able to arise of its own accord in the nature
of things; truly nothing is known of this wider use. For a force acting has a direction that
can always be resolved into two parts, one of which is placed along direction of the
tangent. [p. 226]
DEFINITION 22.
547. The normal force is the force acting on the body describing the line AMB (Fig.
47), the direction of which MR is normal to the element of the curve Mm or the tangent
MT .EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

page 304
Corollary 1.
548. Therefore the normal force can neither increase nor decrease the speed of the body,
since its direction MR is always at right angles to the direction of motion. (164).
Corollary 2.
549. The effect of this force is agreed upon, as we show in what follows, as only the
direction of the body can be changed and affected, because by itself the body progresses
along a straight line, and the action of the normal force makes it move along a curve
(165).
Scholium 1.
550. If a body moves in the same plane, and also the directions of the forces acting on it
are in put in the same plane, then the individual forces can be resolved into two parts, one
of which is the normal, and the other the tangent, as is apparent from the principles of
statics. Whereby when we have determined the effect of the tangential and normal forces
on the body, then likewise also, [p. 227] the effect of any oblique force is also known.
Moreover we call all forces acting on the body oblique, which are neither along the
normal nor the tangent.
Scholion 2.
551. Hence the first division of this chapter arises. For in the first part we consider these
motions that have their paths in the same plane, and likewise all the forces are agreed to
be acting in the same plane. Following this, we are to consider motions that follow paths
that do not lie in the same plane; for which it is understood that it is not sufficient to
resolve the individual forces into two parts, for these are required to be resolved into
three parts, on account of the three dimensions in which the body is moving.

PROBLEM.
552. If a body, as it traverses the element Mm (Fig. 47) in a plane, is acted on by two
forces, the one normal and the other tangential, to determine the effect of each in altering
the motion of the body.
SOLUTION.
Let the speed of the body describing the element
Mm correspond to the height v, the force pulling
along the normal MR is equal to N, and the
tangential force pulling along MT is equal to T, the
element Mm = ds and the radius of osculation at M
= r. [Which we now usually call the radius of
curvature.]
To determine the effect of the force N, since the
direction of this is along the normal at Mm, we use
the formula (165), which is npr = Ac 2 . [p. 228]
p
This becomes pr = 2 Av (209). But here N has been put in place of A for us ; for we
understand by N not only the impression of the force N on the body, but the strength of
the acceleration or the absolute force divided by the mass of the body, [which is A] (213).
p
Whereby here in place of A must be substituted N, with which done we have :
Nr = 2v .
Q. E.D. for the first part. [Thus in modern terms, we have the centripetal acceleration at
the point M , ac = V 2 / r , where V is the tangential speed at this point.]
Then to determine the effect of the tangential force T, I use this rule :
Acdc = npds (166), or in place of this, it is modified to give : Adv = pds (209). And on
p
account of the reasons offered, here in place of A I substitute T, and it becomes
dv = Tds .
Q. E.D. for the second part. [We may wish to consider Tds as the increase in the kinetic
energy of the body supplied by the force T acting along the tangent on a unit mass
through the increment ds, while dv is the corresponding change in a hypothetical
gravitational potential energy of a unit mass under unit gravitational acceleration. One
needs to look at Euler's work in Ch. 2 to see how relations equivalent to these can be
found without recourse to work–energy relations. ]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 1.
553. Because the acceleration of gravity is put equal to 1 [here called force, but in the
sense force per unit mass], the normal acceleration is to the acceleration of gravity as the
height corresponding to the speed to half the radius of osculation [curvature] ; which ratio
follows from the equation Nr = 2v .
[In modern terms, the centripetal acceleration ac = V 2 / r = 2 gh / r = 2.1.v / r = N . ]
Corollary 2.
554. Therefore with the given acceleration to the normal, and the curve that the body
describes, the speed of the body is known at once, for the speed is expressed by v , and
v=
Nr .
2
Corollary 3.
555. Truly the increment of the height corresponding to the speed is always equal to the
product of the tangential acceleration and the element of distance traversed by the body
[p. 229]. Or the element of v is to the element of distance described ds as the tangential
acceleration is to the acceleration of gravity.
PROPOSITION 71.
PROBLEM.
556. If the body, while it traverses the element Mm (Fig. 47), is acted on by some oblique
force in the direction MC, then it is required to determine the effect of this force in
changing the motion of the body.
SOLUTION.
Let this oblique force be in the ratio to the
force of gravity, if on the surface of the earth, as
P to 1, the element Mm = ds and the speed at M
corresponds to the height v. Since the
obliqueness of the force MC has been given, the
angle CMT is given, and on account of this the
triangles CMT and Mmt, which come from the
perpendiculars dropped from C to MT and from
m to MC, are as shown. We can therefore put Mr
= dy and mr = dx, then ds 2 = dx 2 + dy 2 , and the
ratio between both ds, dx, and dy is given. They are now brought together with these
equations (161, 163) that have been presented before (208). For these that we wish to
find here areEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

completely similar to these previous ones,; only in
this respect do they differ, as for us here the ratio is
P:1, while there it was p : A. On this account, we have :
dv = Pdy ,
and with the radius of osculation MR at M put equal to
r this equation is found :
Pr dx = 2vds
p
(208), I write P in place of A . Of these equations :
dv = Pdy defines the increment of the speed, as the body travels through the element
vds shows the lines of the curvatures
Mm. [p. 230] Truly the other, Pr dx = 2vds or r = 2Pdx
at M described by the body. Hence the whole effect of the oblique force on the motion of
the body can become known. Q. E. I.
[The component of P along the curve at M is Pcosθ = Pdy / ds : hence at .ds = dv , where
at is the tangential acceleration, as in the previous chapters ; the component of P normal
to the curve, or the normal acceleration an , is given by
an = P sinθ = Pdx / ds = V 2 / r = 2v / r , where P is taken as the acceleration of a body of
unit mass along MC. ]
Corollary 1.
557. If the oblique force is put in place at an obtuse angle with
the element Mm (Fig. 48), everything remains as before,
except that the line element mr =dy must be taken
( 1 − λ2 ) = μ . Hence dv = − Pdy , and the other equation
Pr dx = 2dvds remains as before.
Corollary 2.
558. Therefore if the direction of the force MC falls between the normal MR and the
element Mm as in Fig. 47, then the motion of the body is one of acceleration. But if CM
falls outside each, as in Fig. 48, the motion is one of retardation.
Corollary 3.
559. If the direction of the force MC falls on the tangent MT, then the angle mMr, Mr is
made equal to Mm or dx = 0 and dy = ds. Therefore we have dv = Pds and r =∝ , which
indicates that the direction of the body is not affected by this tangential force.
Corollary 4.
560. If the direction of the force MC (Fig. 48) on the other part Mt, in which case
Mr = dx = 0 and dy = ds , giving dv = − Pds and r =∝ as before. Therefore only theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

page 308
tangential speed of the body is affected, and the direction of the motion is clearly not
changed.(544). [p. 231]
Corollary 5.
561. The direction of the force MC falls on the normal MR, where the effect of the
normal force is known. Hence in this case dy = 0 and dx = ds . And consequently
dv = 0 and Pr = 2v is produced. Hence the normal force does not affect the speed, but
only the direction of the motion. (548).
Scholium 1.
562. Therefore both the effect of the normal force and of the tangential force on the
motion of the body is known. On which account, when all the forces, as many as act on
the body, are put in a plane in the same way in two's, they can be resolved with one part
normal and the other tangential, and the effect of any forces on the motion of the body
can become known.
Scholium 2.
563. Hence it will be most convenient for motion in the same plane to be subdivided, as
in the first place the directions of all the forces acting are parallel to each other, as in our
region, the directions of the weights are observed to be parallel to each other. Then we
will consider the case, in which the directions of all the forces converge to a single point,
to which also the body is always attracted, and which is the case of the centripetal force,
such as the singular discoveries made by Newton Part I of the Princ. Phil. Nat. Truly in
the third place we introduce and investigate any forces acting on a body [p. 232], which
the motion shall always be about to follow. Moreover we will turn from these individual
cases, as at first we propose direct questions, then indeed also inverse questions, as far as
we have done at this stage, that we may be able to resolve. Always finally, as much as is
permitted, we will progress from the more simple to the more complicated and difficult
cases. [Euler now solves simple projectile motion using his general equations.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
564. If there is a constant force the direction of which is normal everywhere to the right
line AB (Fig. 49) and if a body is projected from A with a given speed along the direction
AH, then it is required to find the curve AMDB described by the body, and the motion of
the body on this curve.
SOLUTION.
The force acting is called g, and the
speed with which the body is projected from
A corresponds to the height c and the cosine
of the angle HAB = λ, with the whole sine
taken equal to 1. Now with the body
travelling through the element Mm = ds , the
speed at M corresponds to the height v,
and PM = y and likewise the radius of
osculation at M = r. On account of which
Mr = dx and mr = dy , and it is apparent that
this case can be referred to Fig. 48, where
the motion of the body is slowing down.
[Note however that the elemental triangle in
Fig. 48 has been rotated counterclockwise about M, resulting in x and y being
interchanged in the diagram, but not in the equations.]
Therefore we have : dv = − gdy and grdx = 2vds (557). From the first of these equations
there arises : v = C − gy , and C must
be found from this, that with y = 0, it
must become v = c. Therefore we
have : [p. 233]
v = c − gy .
[Note also that v and c are actually
multiplied by 1, which is the assumed
acceleration of gravity in Euler's units
on earth, in order that the equation has
the correct dimensions of L2/T2. Thus,
g also is one on earth, but it has been made more general in the equation. It is probably a
good idea to refresh our memory of the derivation of the radius of curvature for a
function y(x) at some regular point. In the extra sketch, the component of the force or
acceleration along the normal to the curve shown is g cosθ = gdx / ds , while the
component along the tangent is g sinθ = gdy / ds . Hence the equation grdx = 2vds can be
reduced to the familiar form V 2 / r = gdx / ds . The radius of curvature is givenEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

by r = ds / dθ = ( ds / dx )( dx / dθ ; now the element of arc ds = dx + dy , and
dy / dx = tanθ , leading to d 2 y / dx 2 = sec 2 θ .dθ / dx and hence
dθ / dx = ( d 2 y / dx 2 ) /( 1 + tan 2 θ ) = ddy / ds 2 . From which it follows
that r = ( ds / dx )( ds 2 / ddy ) = ds 3 / dxddy . The negative sign is applied for a convex
curve as we have here. ]

Corollary 1.
565. Therefore the body falls back on the horizontal line AB at the point B with

AB = g . Indeed the time, in which the body is turning above AB and the curve ADB
is completed, is given by
4μ c

Corollary 2.
566. Moreover 2λμ denotes the sine of the angle, which is twice the sine of the angle
2χ c
HAB. Whereby, if the sine of this angle is called χ, [p. 234] then AB = g . From which
it is apparent that the distance AB to be a maximum, if χ = 1 and thus the angle HAB is
half a right angle, if indeed the body is projected with the same speed c .
Corollary 3.
567. It is also understood that the horizontal motion of the body is uniform. For the times,
in which any arc is described, are proportional to the corresponding abscissa on the line
AB.
Corollary 4.
568. If the body is always projected with the same speed c , but at different angles with
AB, the times in which the motion above AB is completed, are to each other as the sines
of the angles HAB (565).
Corollary 5.
569. The maximum height DE, to which the body can reach, is the vertical line through
2λμc
the point E, taken from AE = g . From which it is apparent that AE is half of AB.

Truly the maximum height itself DE is equal to g , which hence is in proportion to the
square of the sine of the angle HAB.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

570. From the equation y = λ − 2 it is seen that the curve ADB is a parabola, the axis

Corollary 8.
571. Hence the vertex of this parabola is the point D, and the distance DF of the focus F
from the vertex D is equal to λgc . Whereby if the line MF is drawn, this will be

MF = DQ + DF from the nature of the parabola. [For MF 2 = ( y − a )2 + y 2 = ( y + a )2 . ]
Corollary 8.

572. Moreover also MF = DE − MP + DF [= gc − ( y − a ) + a] = gc − y = g . Since truly
v = c − gy is the height corresponding to the speed at M = g .MF . Therefore it is also
apparent that AF = gc , [as c = g .AF ].
Corollary 9.
573. Therefore it is evident that the body describing this parabola has the same speed at
some point M, as the same body acted on by the same uniform force falling straight down
can acquire from that height, which is equal to the distance of the point M from the focus
of the parabola.
Corollary 10.
AE = 2λμ = χ . From which it is evident that

the angle FAE is equal to the complement of twice the angle HAE to the right angle or
rather the excess of twice the angle over the right angle. [ cos FAE = 2λμ = sin 2 HAB ;
FAE = 90 - 2HAB or 2HAB - 90]
Corollary 11.
575. Since the angle AFD is the supplement of the angle AFE, then the angle AFD is
twice the angle HAB. [p. 236] [AFD = 180 - AFE = 90 + FAE = 2HAB. ]
Scholium 1.
576. Therefore the construction of the parabola is easily deduced from these, that
describes the projection of the body with a given speed in a given direction. For with AG
drawn normal to AB, and the angle GAF taken equal to twice the angle HAE, and in this
direction AF is taken equal to the height, from which the same body falling in a straight
line acquires the speed equal to this, with which it is projected from A, from which the
focus point F of the parabola sought is found (573, 575). Again the normal DE through FEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

drawn to the line AB is the axis of this parabola, and the vertex D is found by taking
DF = AF 2− FE . Therefore when the parameter is equal to 4DF, the description of the
parabola is brought into view.
Scholium 2.
577. If g = 1, then we have the case of terrestrial gravity. Concerning which, if there
should be no air present, which might impede the motion of the body on account of
resistance, all projected bodies move in parabolas. Galileo first elicited this truth, and
after him all the writers of mechanics have demonstrated this fact. And indeed it can be
arrived at in a much shorter way without differential equations and differentiation, but we
have preferred to use a general method, which can be widely extended, rather than apply
ourselves too much with the particular solutions, which can only be adapted to that one
case. [p. 237]

PROBLEM.
578. If the body at A (Fig. 50) with a given speed and projected in a given direction is
always attracted to the line AB in some ratio of some function of the distances from this
line, to determine the curve ADB, that the body thus acted upon describes and the whole
motion on this curve.
SOLUTION.
Let the speed at A = c and the sine of the
angle HAB = μ , with the whole sine taken as
1, and the cosine equal to λ. The speed of the
body at M corresponds to the height v and the
element Mm = ds , and likewise the abscissa
AP = x, with the applied line PM = y and the
radius of curvature MR = r. Moreover while
the body is traversing the element Mm, it is
meanwhile pulled by a given force , which
shall be equal to P, for a certain function of y,
in the direction MP. With these put in place,
dv = − Pdy , et Pr dx = 2dvds (557).
Moreover,
∫ Pdy = Y and Y is such a function of y, which is made equal to 0 with y put
equal to 0. Hence, on this account, v = c − Y . Then from the first equation, the value of
dv , is substituted into the other equation Pr dx = 2dvds , and there is obtained :

580. The motion of the body on the curve AM can be considered to be resolved into two
other motions, of which the one becomes lines parallel to the line AB, and the other
follows the perpendiculars to this line AB. In that motion the body progresses following
the line AB, and indeed it either rises or falls with respect to the line AB. Now indeed it is
evident that the progression of the horizontal motion is not to be changed by a force, the
direction of which is always perpendicular to AB, and for this reason this motion must
always be regular and made with the same speed, which arises from the resolution of the
initial motion. Since the direction of the initial motion is along the line AH, the speed of
this c to the progressive speed along AB is as the whole sine 1 to the cosine of the
angle HAB, which is λ. [p. 239] Therefore the speed of progression along AB is λ c ,
from which the time, in which the horizontal motion is completed through the distance
AP = x , comes to equal x , as we have found.

Corollary 2.
581. If the body with the speed c rises from A perpendicularly along AC and we take
AL = PM = y , then the speed at L is equal to the speed at M, clearly v . For
dv = − Pdy and v = c − Y , as we have found for the point M.
Corollary 3.
582. If AC is the total height, to which the body projected up from A with the speed c is
able to reach, then the height CL is that by which the body acquires the same speed by
falling, that it had at M.
Corollary 4.
583. The maximum height DE is found by making dy = 0 , in which case Y = μ 2c , from
which equation the value of y extracted must give the height DE, and the speed at D is of
such as size as that acquired by the body falling from the height CI.
[We can perhaps also see this from energy conservation: The initial kinetic energy of
the body at A is partitioned into a constant amount for the horizontal motion Eh, and an
amount that is all transformed into potential energy at D, Ev. Now, Eh + Ev is constant,
and is equal to the potential energy at C if the body is projected straight up, in which case
the amount of kinetic energy gained in falling is the same as Eh , as the potential energy is
the same at D and I in each case.]

has progressing along AB. [p. 240]
Scholium 2.
585. Indeed the size of AB is not apparent from the equation, since it cannot be
integrated. Yet it is evident that the parts AE and EB are required to be equal, and the
branch DB is similar and equal to the arc DA. For after the body arrives at D, it is
accelerated again in a similar way, in which it was retarded before along AD; because
the force is the same in these same distances from AB and in this way the motion is again
perfectly restored.
Scholium 3.
586. Hence also the inverse problem can be resolved easily, where for a given curve
ADB and with the speed of the body at A, the law of the force is sought which must be
put in place, in order that the body moves on that curve. For from the equation :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

AM, in which the body is moving, and the motion of the body on this curve. [p. 241]
SOLUTION.
The centripetal force acting on the body at

of the body at M shall correspond to the
height v. Then the distance CM is called y,
the element of length Mm is equal to ds and
the perpendicular CT to the tangent of the

Corollary 1.
588. Because the time, in which the arc AM is traversed, is 2.ACM , the times, in which
h c
any arcs can be described, are as the areas taken described by the arc and with the line
drawn from the centre C.
Corollary 2.

589. Then since v = ch2 , it follows that
p
v = h p c . Therefore the speed of the body at
any location of the curve traversed varies inversely as the perpendicular from the centre
C sent to the tangent at that point.

590. This description of the equality of the areas has been established in Newton's first
proposition, from which nearly everything is deduced. Moreover these two properties are
the most general and they only require that the direction of the centripetal force is always
directed towards the centre of the circle. For whatever the size of the centripetal force,
either by a function of the lengths CM, or otherwise expressed, yet each is prevailing
equally. For as in these calculations that we have come across, from the calculation the
centripetal force P might be removed, but yet in these only the direction is abandoned in
the consideration.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

593. These equations are useful in two ways : For in the first place from the given law of
the centripetal force, the nature of the curve can be determined that a body projected
describes. Then also in turn with the help of these equations, if the curve is given, that the
body describes around the centre of force C, it is possible to define the centripetal force
bringing about the motion at any place, in order that the body is free to move on this
curve.
Corollary 5.
594. Since also dv = − Pdy , it is evident, if P is a function of y, the speed everywhere
depends on the distance of the body from the centre and at the same distances the body
must have the same speed.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 6.
595. Therefore just as P is a function of y, so also the curve described can thus be
compared, as with equal distances from the centre the tangents dropped are always equal
to each other, since the speeds vary inversely as the lengths of these perpendiculars (589).
[p. 244 : Later of course considered to be an aspect of the conservation of the angular
momentum of the rotating body.]

596. And always, if P is a function of y, a line EC can be assigned, along which a body
acted on by the centripetal force in falling to the individual points N has the same speed,
that it has on the curve AM at points M with the points equally distant from the centre.
For take CN = CM = y and Nn = mr = dy , if the speed at N is equal to the speed at M,
clearly corresponding to the height v, it is also the case, as the body traverses through the
element Nn, that dv = − Pdy . From which it is understood that the speed at n is always
equal to the speed at m. And thus the body has a speed at the individual points of the line
EC, as great as it has on the curve AM at the same distances from C. If therefore the
initial motion starts from E at which the speed is zero, the speed of the body at the
individual points on the curve AM is known from the given line EC. Therefore we will
use this line EC in later results in defining the speeds of the motion of the body and we
will call that the distance defining the speeds.
Corollary 7.
597. Therefore with the speed given at A, clearly corresponding to the height c, from this
the whole distance EC can be found. For only the distant point E from C needs to be
taken, as the body falling from E is acted upon by this centripetal force and acquires a
speed equal to c at A. [p. 245]

600. Moreover since the curve that a body describes acted upon by a given centripetal
force, cannot be known otherwise than from the equation between the distance of the
body from the centre and the perpendicular dropped on the tangent from the centre,
generally to be judged with difficulty, such is the curve found, when we are accustomed
to explain the nature of the curves by equations between orthogonal coordinates. Yet
nevertheless equations of this kind between the distance from the centre and the
perpendicular to the tangent, provided they are either of algebraic or differential forms, in
which the variables can be separated from each other, are sufficient for the curves sought
to be constructed. But where is possible to investigate thoroughly the nature and order of
these curves, [p. 246] we will give here the method in which these equations between the
distance and the perpendicular can be reduced to ordinary equations between the
coordinates.

PROBLEM.
601. The nature of the curve AM (Fig. 52), that a body acted upon by some centripetal
force is to be described, in order the equation between the orthogonal coordinates CP
and PM referred to fixed axes AC can be defined.
SOLUTION.
As before with the initial speed at A = c ,
AC = a and with the perpendicular from C
dropped to the tangent at A equal to h and in
addition CM = y, CT = p and the centripetal
force at M is equal to P, which is a certain
function of y, then CP is called equal to x
and PM = z, then
CM = ( x 2 + z 2 ) = y or z = ( y 2 − x 2 ) ; for
we keep y in place of z in the calculation,
since in this manner the calculation is easier and shorter, and after handling the whole
operation, with z in readiness to be introduced in place of y. With these in place :
Mm = ( dx 2 + dz 2 ) =
( y 2 dy 2 − 2 yxdydx + y 2 dx 2 )
( y −x )

and Mr =
− ydx + xdy .
( y2 − x2 )
[This use of this auxillary coordinate y, which is just the radial distance of the body from
the centre of force, eases the calculation, where dz2 is found from z 2 = y 2 − x 2 and mr =
dy, giving Mr 2 = Mm2 − dy 2 , leading to Mr.] Therefore we have [see Prop. 74 and
following sketch for the similar triangles]:EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

( y dy − 2 yxdydx + y 2 dx 2 )
and consequently
p=
yxdy − y 2 dx
( y 2 dy 2 − 2 yxdydx + y 2 dx 2 )
.
But for the curve AM , we have elicited the
equation previously (591) : Pdy =
2ch 2 dp
.
p3
Moreover we set Y for the integral of Pdy
thus assumed, [Y is related to the work
done by the centripetal force as the body
moves along y, and hence is the potential
energy function for unit mass and gravity;]
so that it vanishes with y = a. With this
2
done, then Y = C − ch2 , where the
p
constant C on account of p = h, if y = a,
must be equal to c. Hence there comes
about : Y =
cp 2 − ch 2

there is produced :

[We note that h c is the initial angular momentum of unit mass at the point in the orbit
where the speed and the distance from C are perpendicular; while Y is the height
corresponding to the change in the potenial energy of unit mass in a uniform field of g =
1, and hence c − Y is the speed elsewhere corresponding to the perpendicular distance
p, giving the same angular momentum. ]
Which quantity, when Y is a function of y, is also a certain function of y. Hence for this
reason, we have this equation :

Corollary 1.
602. Since u = xy , u expresses the cosine of the angle MCA. And for this reason, this final
equation is separated into the distance of the body from the centre and the cosine of the
angle ACM. Indeed from this equation there emerges immediately the equation between
x and z. [Thus, in this remarkable manner, the equation has been separated into angular
and radial components for the general case. ]

THEOREM.
611. If the centripetal force is as some function of the distance from the centre C (Fig.
53), and a body at A is projected following the direction normal to AC with a speed, of
which the corresponding height has a ratio to half AC as the centripetal force at A is to
the force of gravity 1, then this body moves uniformly on the circumference of the circle
AMBA, the centre of which is C.
DEMONSTRATION.
Indeed the body moves in this circle ; since
the distance of this from the centre of the circle
does not change ever from the centripetal force
acting towards C, also for any function of the
distance if it is in proportion to the centripetal
force. And since it is acting towards the centre
C, the direction of the force acting is always
normal to any small portion of the curve, along
which the body is moving. On this account it is
always acted on by a normal force, and
nowhere by one along the tangent, and hence,
and for this reason this speed always remains
the same (561), and thus the body describes the periphery with a uniform motion. Then
since the centripetal or normal force is always the same, put this equal to g and likewise
the constant speed corresponds to the height c and the radius AC = a, which quantity a is
everywhere shown to be the radius of curvature. Therefore with these in place ag = 2c
(561)[ dv = 0 and Pr = 2v ]. From which this ratio arises : As the height to the speed of
the body, with which it is initially projected from A, there corresponds c to half the
distance AC, 12 a , thus as the centripetal force g to the force of gravity 1. Q.E.D. [p. 251]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 1.
612. Therefore when the body has once described an arc of the circle, the centre of which
is itself the centre of force C, then it rotates for ever on the periphery of that circle. If
indeed the centripetal force only depends on the distances from the centre, thus as with
equal distances, the centripetal force is always equal.
Corollary 2.
613. With the ratio of the diameter to the periphery put as 1 : π, the periphery of the
circle in which the body is moving is equal to 2πa. Then since the speed, with which the
body is moving, is equal to
c=
ag
, the time of one period along the whole periphery
2
is equal to 2π 2a .
g
Corollary 3.
614. If therefore many bodies are moving in different circles, the time of the revolutions
are in the square root ratio composed as directly from the radii of the circles and
inversely as the centripetal forces.
Corollary 4.
615. If the body is projected from A perpendicularly to AC, but with a speed either
greater or less than
ag
, then the body describes the arc of a circle, the radius of which
2
is either greater or less than AC. [p. 252]
Corollary 5.
616. Therefore in this case, when the body begins to move along the arc of the circle, the
centre of which is not at C, suddenly it approaches more towards, or recedes from, the
centre of the force. And this sudden motion arises from the action of another centripetal
force, unless perhaps the centripetal force is the same everywhere.
Scholium.
617. Moreover the body is projected with some speed from A (Fig. 54), but the direction
of this is a perpendicular crossing the line AC
through the centre of force C, and the curve
BMAND has this property, in order that the potions
AMB and AND of this, placed on this side and the
other side of AC are similar and equal to each other,
and AC is the axis and diameter of this curve. For
since, as we have now agreed, the centripetal force is
proportional to a certain function of the distances
from the centre, the body either above or below AC
is acted on by an equal force at the same distance
from C, and for this reason this body must move
towards A in the same way along DNA, as it moves away from A along AMB, and also it
has the same speed at the homologous points M and N.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 6.
618. Therefore every line drawn from the centre C, which is normal to the curve, is
likewise a diameter of the curve ; thus in order that the parts of the curve on placed on
this or that side of this line are equal and similar to each other.[p. 253]
PROPOSITION 77.
THEOREM.
619. If more bodies are moving around the centre of force C (Fig. 55) and describe the
similar curves AM and am about C, the speeds at the similar points M and m are in the
square root ratio composed from the ratios of the homologous sides and of the centripetal
forces at the homologous points M and m.
DEMONSTRATION.
Because AC : aC = MC : mC, also the
radius of osculation at M is in the same ratio
to the radius of osculation at m, as also is the
perpendicular CT to Ct. From proposition 74
(587) it is truly apparent that Pr dx = 2vds ,
[i. e. the centripetal force equation normal to
the curve with radius of curvature r] or, with
y
ds ,
put in place of dx
p
Ppr = 2vy . Hence
therefore the speed is given by :
v=
Ppr
.
2y
From which this ratio is produced : the speed at M is to the speed at m in the square root
ratio composed from the direct ratios of the centripetal forces at M and m and the
perpendiculars CT to cT, and in the inverse ratio of the distances MC to mC. Since truly
CT is to cT as MC is to mC and the radius of osculation at M is to the radius of osculation
at m as MC is to mC, then the speed at M to the speed at m is in the square root ratio
composed from the ratios of the centripetal forces at M and m and of the homologous
sides MC to mC. Q.E.D.
Corollary 1.
620. If therefore we call AC = A, aC = a, CD = H and Cd= h, and likewise the speed at
A=
C and at a =
c , the angular speed at M = H C2 [p. 254] and the angular speed at
MC
m = h C2 (599). But since H : h = MC : mC = A : a, the angular speeds at M and m are
as

points.

623. Moreover from this proposition it is evident that the speed at A, C , to the speed at
a, c , are in the square root ratio composed from the ratios of the centripetal forces at A
and a and of the homologous sides A and a. Whereby if the said centripetal force at A =
G and the centripetal force at a = g, then we have the ratio :
C : c = AG : ag . [p. 255]

624. Consequently the time to pass through AM is to the time to pass through am as
A :

a , i. e. in ratio composed with the square root from the direct proportions of the

homologous sides and inversely as the centripetal forces at the points A and a. Therefore
this ratio is constant, and the whole times of the revolutions must keep the same values
between each other.

625. Also in this case, in which several similar figures are described around the centre C,
the centripetal forces in the homologous points must maintain the same ratio. For since
the force P =
2ch 2 y
(592), the centripetal force at M to the centripetal force at m is
p 3r
directly as the square of the speed at A to the square of the speed at a and inversely as AC
to aC, which is a constant ratio. On account of which, when more similar figures are to be
described around the centre C, it is required that a centripetal force of this kind of the
distances can be expressed by a function, which presents the centripetal forces in the
same ratio at the homologous positions. Clearly with the centripetal force P put at the
distance y and Q at the distance my, P to Q must have a constant ratio, in which y is not
present. For unless this is done, then it cannot be made to happen, that more similar
figures can be described around the centre C.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

distance from the centre C, then indeed it is not possible to happen, that more similar
figures can be described around the centre C. And only with these cases do they have the
properties in place, that we have elicited from this proposition.

PROPOSITION 78. PROBLEM.

631. If the centre of force C attracts directly in the ratio of the distances (Fig. 56) and a
body is projected from A following the direction normal to a given radius AC, to
determine the curve AMDBH that the body describes, and the speed of the body at
particular points.
SOLUTION.
The distance CA is put equal to a, and the
perpendicular dropped from C on the direction
of the motion is equal to a. Truly the speed at A
corresponds to the height c. On arriving at M,
the distance CM = y; and the perpendicular CT
from C sent to the tangent at M is put equal to
p, and the speed at M corresponds to the height
v. Again the distance at which the centripetal
force is equal to the force of gravity is f; and
y
the centripetal force at M = f , with the force
y
of gravity equal to 1. When these are compared with Prop.75 (601), P = f and
y 2 −a2
Y = 2f
. On account of which we have : p =
a 2cf
a + 2cf − y 2

For truly v = a 2c (587), from which it follows that v =

a 2 + 2cf − y 2

4a 2 cf
(610). The constant amount C can be determined from this equation, since by making
u = 1 it comes about that y = a. Hence therefore, C =
2cf − a 2
, thus
4a 2 cf
( A2 − C 2 ) = 0 .

on account of u = xy . Therefore this equation results :
a 2 y 2 − a 2 2cf = ( a 2 − 2cf )x 2 .
The applied line MP is put equal to z, and y 2 = x 2 + z 2 . Hence the following equation is
produced between the orthogonal coordinates for the curve sought:
a 2 z 2 + 2cfx 2 = 2a 2cf .
This is the equation for an ellipse, the centre of which is situated at C, and AB = 2a is the
length of one axis, and indeed the length of the other DH = 2 2cf . Q.E.I.

a 2 + 2cf − y 2

636. The distance determining the speeds CE (596, 597) is always equal to the sub-
tangent AD. For by putting CE = k the body falls from E towards C drawn by the
centripetal force; the body must have, when it arrives at A, a speed corresponding to the
height c. On account of which, k = ( a 2 + 2cf ) (275). Moreover since
AC = a and CD = 2cf , then CE = ( AC 2 + CD 2 ) = AD .
Corollary 5.
637. The height corresponding to the speed, which the body moving along the line EC
can acquire, when it comes to C , is given by :

Corollary 6.
638. The time, in which the arc AM is absolved, is equal to 2.ACM (588) as h = a in this
a c
case. [p. 260] On this account the time of the whole revolution around the perimeter of
the ellipse ADBHA is equal to
2. Area of Ellipse
. With the ratio of the diameter to the
a c
periphery put in place 1 : π , the elliptic distance is equal to πa 2cf . Consequently the
time of one revolution is 2π 2 f .

Corollary 7.

639. Therefore if more bodies are rotating in ellipses around the same centre of force
attracting in the direct ratio of the distances, the times for the whole revolutions are equal
to each other.

Scholium 2.

640. When the initial direction of the body at the point A is not put normal to the radius
AC, the calculation does not present an ellipse for the curve described by the body, but
another curve of the fourth order, which yet cannot be considered to be satisfactory. The
reason for this disagreement between the calculation and the truth depends on this, that
the expression of the sine of the angle, which is put in place by the curve with the radius,
taken in y and u always avoids being equal to 1, with y put equal to a and u = 1, even if
the following hypothesis must produce another quantity. For the sine of the angle, which
the curve makes with the radius, is given by :
ydu
dy −u dy 2 + y 2 du 2
2
2
,
which expression with u made equal to 1 evidently departs from unity, when yet it should
give ah . On account of this it is evident, unless h is put equal to a, a calculation set up in
this way can never agree with the truth, if indeed the equation between u and y must be
found. Therefore this rule must always be stretched, [p. 261] as often as the curve to be
investigated follows the teaching of Prop.75 (601). Moreover the method handled in this
proposition has only been found to be convenient for algebraic curves ; and indeed it is
required to use another method, if the curves are transcendental. But all algebraic curves
enjoy the use of this property, so that in these from any point it is possible to draw a
perpendicular.
[In the Opera Omnia there is a note added by Paul Stackel :
'This proposition seized upon by Euler without demonstration is easily shown to be false
by considering Neil's parabola ' . However , this curve is not a closed orbit, as it is a
3
function of the form y = ax 2 , and it appears that Euler is concerned here with closed or
negative energy orbits, for which there must be turning points in a physical sense, at
which the radius is perpendicualar to the curve, so that the body can return to its original
position. There are of course open or positive energy hyperbolic and parabolic orbits
where this condition is satisfied, but which do not have a finite period. Comets, for
example, may have bound orbits and return periodically, or be free on hyperbolic orbits
and never return. Other motions such as the two dimensional mass on a massless spring
are performing bound orbits. I have not had time to check the results in this last
proposition; if someone feels they would like to do so, I would be glad to hear from them
regarding their conclusions. ]
Concerning which, as often as the body revolves on an algebraic curve around the centre
of curvature, always one of more points can be assigned, at which the radius is
perpendicular to the curve. Therefore the body should be put to begin moving at points of
this kind, and the calculation is always in agreement with the truth. Moreover from such a
solution the speed of the body is easily found at any other place, and hence by the inverse
method from the given speed of the body at a point, at which the radius is not normal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

the curve, the speed may be found at a place, where the radius falls normal to the curve.
Moreover how this should be effected, is evident from the following proposition.
Truly from the properties of algebraic curves recalled above, where from any given
point a perpendicular can be dropped on these, but not all transcendental curves agree
with this. For in the logarithmic spiral no radius can be drawn from the centre normal to
the curve, but always with at some constant angle that has been found.
When finally the ratio can be realised, whereby
ydu
dy −u dy 2 + y 2 du 2
2
2
u is always made equal to 1, can be changed into one, since still any other angle too,
besides a right angle, can be produced from that formula, u departing from one should be
considered 1, [p. 262] and the element du is to vanish before dy, unless the tangent at A
is normal to the radius AC. Hence on this account by putting u = 1 the element
dy 2 ( 1 − u 2 ) is not to be neglected with the ratio y 2du 2 , since each vanishes, as ydu in
the numerator. By which it happens, that the sine of any arbitrary angle from that formula
by making u = 1 can be expressed. But since this warning in the calculation cannot be
observed, except the case h = a the calculation cannot show the true curve anywhere.
