PROPOSITION 92. PROBLEM

763. To find the centripetal forces acting towards two centres C and D (Fig. 69), which
can be composed, in order that the body moves on a given curve AMB and with the speed
given at individual points M.

SOLUTION.

764. The body is moving from A through M to B and its speed at M corresponds to the
height v; and putting CM = y, DM = z. Truly with the tangent TV drawn at that point, and
with perpendiculars CT and DV sent from C and D , called CT = p and DV = q. Again
the centripetal force, that attracts towards C is equal to P, and that which pulls towards D
is equal to Q. Therefore the normal force arising from each is equal to
and the tangential force accelerating the motion of the body is equal to
for falling tangents as previously. Therefore with the radius of osculation at M equal to r
and with the element of the curve equal to ds then [p. 317]

PROPOSITION 93. PROBLEM


767. A body is moving with a given speed on a curve also given AMB (Fig. 70), and it is
required to find the centripetal force acting towards the centre C together with a force
always acting normally to the line AB pulling the body in the direction MP, which two
forces have the effect that the body is free to move on this curve with the prescribed
speed.


SOLUTION.

Let the speed of the body present at the point
M correspond to the height v and the distance
MC = y, and the perpendicular MP = z. The
force pulling the body towards the centre C is
put equal to P and the force acting along MP
is equal to Q. With the tangent MV at M
drawn, the perpendiculars CT and PG are sent
to that, which are called p and q. With these
put in place, the normal force arising from
both these forces is equal to

Scholium.

770. Observe that from this proposition, in which the curve described by the body is
given, [conversely] a little of the usefulness follows in the determination of curves which
bodies describe, acted on by composite forces. Indeed it is true that it is permitted to
progress from this to other propositions, in which the curves described by bodies are not
themselves given, but they are generated under the motion of one or more given forces,
as in the above propositions in which the motion of the apsides has been treated.

PROPOSITION 94. [p. 320] PROBLEM.

771. If the body is moving on the curve AMB (Fig. 71) in whatever manner, while the
curve itself is revolving around the central fixed point C, it is required to find two forces,
one of which is always acting towards the fixed point C, and the other is directed
normally to the line in the given position PC, which two forces have the effect that the
body is free to move in this orbit.

SOLUTION.

Let the speed of the body present at
M, in which it traverses the element
of the curve itself Mm, correspond to
the height v, and the angular speed of
the body in the orbit to the true
angular speed of the body be in the
ratio about C as 1 to w, or the angular
speed of the body in orbit to the
angular speed of the orbit itself,
while the body is at M, is as 1 to w –

CM is put equal to y and the
perpendicular CT from C sent to the tangent of the orbit at M is equal to p, while the
tangent itself MT is equal to q, thus in order that q = ( y 2 − p 2 ) . From M the
perpendicular MP which is called z, is sent to the position of the given line DP, and CP
is called x, thus in order that x = ( y 2 − z 2 ) . Now while the element Mm is traversed,
meanwhile the orbital angle is put equal to mCμ of the circumference; as from the
composite motion of the body it arrives at μ, with Cμ = Cm , Mμ is an element of the
true curve in which the body is moving, in which produced the perpendicular CΘ is sent
from C. With centre C the little arc Mnν is described, [p. 321] where we have :

777. These formulae for the curve of the ellipse can be made simpler in various ways, if
the curve in which the body is moving is approximately circular. And in this case it is of
some use in the theoretical motion of the moon to be defined. [p. 324] For the earth is put
at rest at C and the sun on the line CP perpendicular at C is considered equally as being at
rest ; with which put in place and with these forces compared both with the forces of the
sun and the earth, the synodal motion of the moon is elicited for some position of the
apsidal line and likewise the motion of the apsidal line, which only differs slightly from
the true motion of the moon.

Scholium 2.

778. This proposition certainly appears of greater extent than the above (729), in which
all the force was directed towards the centre of rotation of the orbit; indeed the former is
included with the force Q vanishing. Yet the quadrature cannot account perfectly for the
motion of the moon because the proportional force in P varies inversely with the cube of
the distance MC (773). Because of this we offer other orbits besides the gyrations in the
middle, and which appear wider and agree more with the physics questions. Of this kind
are the motions of orbits by which curves are always in orbits parallel to themselves,
which on contemplation deserve to be preferred from others, since the forces acting are
both easier to find and the formulas are simpler to understand. Moreover there is an
outstanding need for this, and the following theorem is presented.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROPOSITION 95.
THEOREM.
779. The body is moving along the curve AM (Fig. 72), by some force acting around the
point C, and in addition [p. 325] both the body and the point C are acted on by a force in
the same direction; there is the relative motion of the body M with respect to the point C
or the motion of the body M such as is seen from C, and likewise, if this new force is not
to be added..

DEMONSTRATION.

With the point C at rest in the element of
time dt the body arrives at the point m from
M in m. Therefore in this small finite time the
body M is apart from C by the interval mC
and makes the angle mCA with a certain fixed
line AC expressed in the region. Now with
the body put present at M , both the body M
and the point C are to be acted on by a force
towards the same place, thus in order that the
point C can be advanced through Cc in the
small time dt. Therefore in the same short
time dt the body M, if at rest, by this force is carried through the distance Mn parallel and
itself equal to Cc. But since the body M now has the motion in place, in which element
of time dt it traverses the distance Mm, then with both motions connected together it
describes the diagonal Mμ to complete the parallelogram Mmμn. Wherefore with the
occurrence of this new force, the body M in the short finite time dt is at a distance from
the point C, that meanwhile is translated to c by the interval μc, and with the line ac
drawn parallel to AC in the fixed direction, it makes the angle μca. But since mCcμ is a
parallelogram μc = mC and the angle mCA is equal to the angle μca. Consequently the
force is acting equally at each point M and C equally and acting along the same direction,
it does not change the motion of M relative to the point C. Q.E.D. [p. 326]
Corollary 1.
780. Therefore whatever the force acting at the point C, if the same likewise acts on the
body M along the same direction, then the relative motion of the body M with respect to
the point C does not change.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.
Chapter Five (part d).
Translated and annotated by Ian Bruce.
page 459
Corollary 2.
781. Therefore a force of this kind can be put into effect acting equally on M and C, in
order that the body M is moving in the moving orbit AM in some manner. Moreover the
orbit by its own motion is able to follow the motion of the point C, as its position always
remains parallel to the position of that point.
Corollary 3.
782. It is also seen from the demonstration of the proposition, if an equal speed is
impressed on both the point C and the body M along the same direction, then the relative
motion is not going to be disturbed.
Corollary 4.
783. With such motion impressed on the point C, it continues to move indefinitely in
some direction without the continuation of any force, and the body M follows moving
uniformly around the point C, that can be equally progressing or at rest. For this
situation is only maintained, provided the same direction and speed of the body C are
added to the body M.
Corollary 5.
784. Therefore the body is free to describe the same curve about the centre of force C that
is progressing uniformly [p. 327], that it describes about C at rest, but to M must be
added as well as much speed as has been accepted by the centre of force.
Corollary 6.
785. Moreover, as the body left to itself is unable by itself to progress along the curved
line, nor to move unequally along a straight line; thus the body moving around the
moving centre of force, either in performing the required curved motion or changes in the
direction, cannot describe the same curve that is does for the resting position, but it is
always urged on by the above force, to the extent required to maintain the motion along
its own path.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEMA.
786. If the body M (Fig. 71) is revolving around the centre of force L at rest in the curve
BM, to determine the force that is effective in order that the body in the same orbit
following the same curve AL is moving in a direction always parallel to itself.
SOLUTION.
Since the body M is freely moving in the
orbit BM about the centre of force L at rest,
then, with the distance LM = y and with the
perpendicular sent from L to the tangent at M
equal to p, the height corresponding to the
2
speed at M = a 2c (589) and the centripetal
p
force acting towards L is equal to
2a 2 cdp
p 3 dy
(592). Now the centre L is put to be moving
on the curve AL attracted to the centre of force
C, and CL = c and the perpendicular sent from C to the tangent [p. 328] at L is equal to
2
w. With which put in place the height corresponding to the speed at L = b 2e and the force
w
2
attracting the point L to C is equal to 2b 3edw (592). Moreover the speed impressed on the
w ds
first point L along the tangent is equal to b we and it is also the same for the body M
following the direction parallel to this tangent; and it is evident, if no additional force
acts on the point L, but only this impressed motion is conserved, then the motion of the
body M gone through is thus obtained following the motion of the point L , moving
freely on the same curve BM, in order that the axis BL always remains parallel to the
motion of L (783). But when the body M is moving in the same way around the
advancing point L on the curve AL, it is required, as such a force is itself always acting,
that it is of such a size as is necessary to keep the point L on this curve AL (781).
Therefore, with MN drawn parallel to LC, the body M besides the force by which it is
2
urged towards L, must also be acted on by a force equal to 2b 3edw along the direction
w ds
MN. Whereby this two-fold force has the effect of solving the problem of the motion. For
which moreover it is apparent, since the body M is acted on by the force with respect to
the point C and to the fixed line AC parallel to BL, that the forces acting along MN and
ML on the body M are to be resolved in two others, of which one has the direction MC,
and the other MP, which line MP has been drawn perpendicular to AC. To this outstanding line MP is drawn the parallel line KLN cutting the line MC at O and the
distance LI = x, MI = z, CK = r, KL = t and CP = X, PM = Z and CM = Y. On this
account,

And again,
[p. 329] Besides indeed X = r + x and Z = t + z . Whereby on account of the given
curves AL and BM since z, y, and p in x, and likewise t, s, and w in r are given, all these
quantities in X, Z, and Y are able to be shown. Truly the equation between X and Z can
be deduced from that, because the increment of the time through BM is equal to the
increment through AL. Hence we therefore have :
and from the integrals taken, the area ACL ± some constant area is to the area BLM
as b e to a c . Therefore the force pulling along ML is resolved into two forces pulling
along MO and LO or MI, and in a similar way the force along MN is resolved into two
forces pulling along MO and NO , of which the latter acts on the opposite direction to MI
on the body M ; to which resolved forces put in place it is necessary to know the angles.
For indeed the angle MLO is equal to the angle LMI and therefore the sine of this is equal
to xy and the cosine zy , by taking 1 for the total sine. Similarly the angles MON and
CMP are equal, therefore the sine of this is YX and the cosine YZ . Therefore the sine of
− Zx . And finally the
the angle LMO, which is the difference of these, is equal to XzYy
angles MNQ and CLK are equal, whereby the sine is equal to rs and the cosine st .
− Xt . Also,
Consequently as NMO = NMO = MNQ – MON the sine of this angle is ZrYs
Xx − Zx = Zr − Xt as X = r + x and Z = t + z .
From these the ratio of MN:MO or YX : rs can be made and thus the ratio of the force

From these collected together the body M is acted on by a force pulling in the
direction of MC equal to:
and by a force along MP :
Which expressions can all be shown in terms of X, Z and Y and besides an equation can
be assigned between these quantities which relate to the true curve described by the body
M. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
787. If the curve AL is the periphery of a circle, the centre of which is C and the radius
AC = b, then s = w = b and r 2 + t 2 = b 2 . Therefore in this case the force pulling along
MC is equal to :
and the force along MP is equal to :
And e is the height corresponds to the speed of the point L.
Corollary 2.
788. Let the curve BM be an ellipse having the centre at L, and BL= a is the transverse
semi-axis of this curve, thus in order that the height corresponding to the speed at B is
equal to c, and indeed the other axis is set equal to h. And the equations arise :
Whereby the force along MC becomes equal to :

[p. 331] And the force along MP is equal to :

789. And if the curve AL is the circle as in Cor.1 and the curve BM the ellipse as in Cor.

792. Finally we can add this corollary, as it is apparent that such forces are required for a
body to be turning in an epicycle about a centre of force, as the adherents of Ptolemy
considered the planets to move.
Corollary 6.
793. From the hypothesis of Cor. 3 it is understood, that if e2 = c2 , or the speed of the
b
h
body L to the speed of the body M at B as the diameter of the circle AL is to the conjugate
axis of the ellipse BM, then the true curve described by the body M is an ellipse with the
centre at C, when the force acting towards C becomes equal to 2eY
2 and with the force
b
along MP vanishing. The semi-major axis of this ellipse is b + a, and the minor truly
b + h.
Scholium 2.
794. I have therefore especially reported on this Proposition, because in an appendix to
the new edition of Newton's Principia in English, the most distinguished Machin asserts
[John Machin (1680-1751), The mathematical principles of natural philosophy translated
into English, London 1729; to which book the Appendix has been added : The laws of the
motion of the moon. P. St.] that the motion of the moon can be considered as in an ellipse,
the transverse axis of which shall be in the ratio of 2 : 1 to the conjugate axis made
around the centre of the ellipse, while meanwhile with that ellipse itself moving parallel
to the periphery of a circle, on which it progresses freely, as I have explained in Cor. 3.
For my part, I do not deny that this motion is extremely similar to the motion that the
moon can show, but I would doubt very much that it was an exact ratio. Moreover in the
following proposition I have decided to determine, what needs to be indicated to
determine the motion of the moon, [p. 333]. Even if indeed this proposition pertains to
astronomy, yet it is assumed that the method reported here can be used to examine
fundamental questions of this kind that are to be resolved.
[At this time, the laws governing angular momentum and the conservation of energy were
not yet fully understood; in the following proposition the inverse square law solution is
taken for the earth in a circular orbit, and the moon is assumed to rotate about the earth in
an elliptical orbit according to the same law. The moon is given, along with the sun, the
negative of the earth's centripetal acceleration, resulting in the moon's orbit being
transported parallel to itself according to a person on the earth, Thus, the problem is
reduced to one of kinematics.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

795. With the sun at rest at S (Fig. 74) and with the earth T moving around it uniformly
in the circle TD while the moon L is attracted to the earth T as to the sun S in the inverse
square of the distances; with which put in place it is required to determine the motion of
the moon, such as can be seen from the earth T.
SOLUTION.
The distance of the earth from the sun ST is put
equal to a and the force, and the force which
attracts the earth to the sun is equal to
f
. The
a2
distance of the moon from the earth is equal to y
and the distance of the moon from the sun LS is
equal to z. The force, by which the moon is
attracted to the earth, is equal to h2 ; and indeed the
y
force, by which the moon is attracted to the sun
f
. [Paul Stackel's note : In
z2
f
f
the formulas 2 and 2 , the letter f does not have
a
z
along LS, is equal to
the same value. On this account the solution to the problem would have to be modified.
This translator's note : Euler always deals with accelerations, or the forces per unit mass;
thus, I am inclined to believe he has the accelerations of the bodies in mind here, rather
than the actual forces, in which case the formulas are the same and so are correct. Euler
talks about forces or strengths of forces where we would use the word acceleration.]
Therefore from these forces acting, such lunar motion produced is to be investigated. But
since it is agreed that such motion of the moon is to be viewed from the earth, then the
earth is considered at rest ; when it is done, while the motion for the whole system is
viewed relative to the earth, then equal and likewise opposite accelerations must be
applied to that which the earth receives from the sun [and the moon], with the moon and
the sun known to be carried round in the opposite direction to their true motion. [Euler is
concerned with a kinematic problem involving relative accelerations; the basic physics
has been attended to already in the setting up of the orbits. There is no question of an
earth-centred dynamics problem being solved. He tries to fit a solution to this vexing
problem.][p. 334] Moreover the speed of the earth in the orbit TD corresponds to the
f
height 2a , as can be gathered from the force
f
by which the earth is drawn towards the
a2
sun. Therefore such a speed must be impressed both on the sun and the moon along the
direction normal to TS. Besides, since the earth is drawn to the sun by the force
f
, it is
a2

necessary that the effect of this force is the destruction of the original force, and if the sun
is always attracted to the earth by such a force, then the moon truly is acted on by the
same force along the line LN parallel to ST itself [meaning that they have a common
acceleration which is the opposite of the centripetal acceleration of the earth towards the
sun]. With this done the sun describes a circle SE around the earth T at rest with the same
speed, which before the earth was carried around the sun. Truly the moon besides the
forces pulling along LT and LS above is urged by a force equal to
With LM drawn parallel to TS also, the force acting along LS
f
a2
in the direction LN .
f
is resolved into these
z2
two forces, of which one is in the direction LT, and the other along LM. Hence by
fy
z
considering the triangle LTS the force arises acting along LT equal to 3 and the force
pulling along LM equal to
af
. Whereby with these forces combined, the moon is pulled
z3
in the direction LT by a force equal to :
and in the direction LM by a force equal to :
from which forces the motion of the moon must be determined. Moreover it is to be noted
that the direction LM is not constant but variable, clearly always parallel to the radius TS,
which on account of the motion of the sun is carried along the periphery SE. Therefore
with ST produced in A, in order that AB is the line of the conjunctions, and from L by
sending the perpendicular LP to the line AB, TP is equal and parallel to LM. [p. 335] In
the small interval of time dt the moon travels from L to l, and moreover the sun from S to
s; and therefore meanwhile the line of conjunctions is carried to ab and the moon at l is
acted on in part by a force along lT, and in part by a force pulling along the line parallel
to Tp, clearly with the perpendicular lp sent from l to Ta. Moreover from these forces
resolved, the normal and tangential force can be found, of which either gives the speed of
the moon. Moreover these two equations can be solved to eliminate the speed, and
present the equation of the curve ABL, in which the moon can be determined to move.

Scholium 1.

796. The equations which hence are deduced for the motion of the moon, become so
complex that from them neither the orbit of the moon nor the position of the apsides of
this motion can be exactly determined. Moreover truly from the same calculation by
neglecting very small quantities in a certain way approximate conclusions for the use of
astronomy can be drawn, as the great Newton did in Book III of the Phil. Princ.
Moreover even if this inconvenient calculation does not work, yet from this proposition
without a great deal of rigor, the motion of the moon may soon be demonstrated. For we
have put the sun forwards again as being at rest, which in a short while disagrees with the
truth; then we consider the earth moving in a circle, and the orbit of the moon placed in the same plane with the earth, which likewise they have otherwise. Yet meanwhile it is
certain, if the solution of this proposition can evolve and from that a table constructed,
then it would be of the most use in astronomy. [p. 336]

Corollary 1.

797. Since the distance of the moon from the earth is very small with respect to the
distance of the earth from the sun, it is possible to put z = a without sensible error and it
is almost possible to put in that case the force acting along LM to vanish and the only
force drawing the moon to the earth is equal to :

Corollary 2.

798. When the orbit of the moon does not differ much from a circle, it is possible in that
case to consider the form of the moving ellipse, as we have done in Prop. 91 (747).
Whereby a knowledge of the motion of the apsides is obtained from Coroll. 3 of this
Proposition (750).
and the moon arrives at the apogee from the perigee from the absolute angular motion
around the earth by turning through an angle equal to :
where y, which does not change much, can be considered as a constant.
Scholium 2.
799. Therefore the line of the apsides of the moon's motion is continually regressing,
since
a 3 h + fy 3
is less than one, which is contrary to observation. Truly the reason for this
a 3 h + 4 fy 3
error is that we have considered the quantity z as being constant. For although [the sun-
moon distance] z is neither much increased or decreased in the ratio of this to itself, yet
the increments and decrements with respect to the increments of y are small enough to be
disregarded. [p. 337] Whereby, when the differential of P must be taken, in that equation
we have wrongly considered z as constant and put a in its place. Moreover, since z
cannot be given by y, the motion of the apsides cannot be determined in this way.
Meanwhile nevertheless this is gathered, if it is the case that ady > ydz, then the line of
apsides is as in the preceding, but if ady < ydz, as a consequence it is to be moving
forwards, if indeed we stop thinking about a force acting along LM 


Corollary 3.

800. W ith LM = TP = x then we have approximately z = a + x , where x very small with
respect to a. Therefore by ignoring x before a then the force, which pulls the moon to the
fy
3 fx
earth is equal to h2 + 3 and the force which is pulling along LM is equal to 3 . This
y
a
a
therefore vanishes when the moon is at right angles in its orbit to the earth, and is a
maximum when the moon is in conjugation.

Scholium 3.

801. Moreover since this is not the place to pursue considerations of the motion of the
moon in more detail, which are clearly pertinent to the theoretical astronomy, we will
proceed to piece together what remains from our present arrangement. For the principles
are sufficiently well understood to the extent that tables of the movements can be
constructed for any case of interest and the respective motions can be found from the
tables. Moreover, the motions of free bodies which are not made in the same plane
remain to be included in this chapter [p. 338]. Indeed from the preceding it is evident that
for a singe centripetal force present, the motion of the body always takes place in the
same plane as the body was initially projected; and if there are several centres of force
placed in the same plane in which the body is projected, then the curve described by the
body is likewise completely in the same plane. What follows must therefore refer to the
situation when a body is acted on by several forces, the directions of which lie in
different planes; or also when the direction, along which the body is initially projected, is
not in situated in that plane in which the directions of the forces are placed. Therefore in
these cases, the motion of the body must be considered as if a certain curve is described
on a certain convex or concave surface. Moreover the nature of the surface is expressed
by an equation involving three variables, and from the nature of the line drawn on that
surface that same equation is solved with another equation either in these three variables
as well, or only two. For from these, the projection of the curved line onto a given plane
can become known, and from the projection and the surface, likewise the curve described
by the body placed on the surface is known. Again as in the co-planar case, the forces can
be reduced to two, along the normal and the tangent, thus in this current business, the
forces can be reduced to three (551), and what effect they exert on the body, we are about
to find out. [p. 339]
