THE CURVILINEAR MOTION OF FREE POINTS ACTED ON BY ABSOLUTE FORCES OF ANY KIND.


PROPOSITION 98. THEOREM.

802. There are three principal forces which can be put in place, and into which other
forces must be resolved, in order that a body can move on a curve that does not exist in a
plane; these individual forces are normal to each other; and of these one is the tangential
force, and the remaining two are normal to that force, of which one lies in the given
plane, and the direction of the other is normal to this plane, and nothing remains of the
original forces to change the actions of these forces.

DEMONSTRATION.

With the plane APQ assumed fixed [in space] (Fig. 75) and relative to that axis AP, an
element Mm is described by a body. From the points M and m the perpendiculars MQ and
mq are sent to the fixed plane and from the points Q and q, perpendiculars QP and qp are
sent to the axis AP. Now, if the body is not acted on by any force, then it progresses along
the line Mm produced with the speed that is has in Mm ; therefore in an equal small
interval of time, equal to the time in which it traversed Mm, it arrives at n, with the
element mn described equal to and in the same direction as that put for the element Mm.
Whereby by also sending a perpendicular nr from n to the plane APQ, then the elements
Qq and qr are also equal to each other and placed in the same direction ; because of this,
the perpendicular rπ sent from r to the axis AP cuts off the element pπ = Pp.
Let the speed in which the first element Mm is described, correspond to the height v,
and in the first place the tangential force is considered, which has a direction along mn
and the whole force is taken up with changing the speed. This tangential force T is put in
place with the existing force of gravity equal to 1, and we have [p. 340]
dv = T .Mm ,
and the element mn is completed with a speed corresponding to the height v + dv.
Following this, in the plane Mr there is considered a force having a direction ms
normal to the direction Mm of the body. This therefore has the effect that the body can
deflect from mn and progress along the element mv placed in the same plane as Mr. Let
this normal force be equal to N, and since the radius of osculation of the elements Mm
and mν , with the perpendicular νε sent along fromν to mn is equal to mνεν [In triangle
2
mεν , we can set ds = Rdθ , where ds = mν and dθ = εν / mν , giving the required result
for the radius R], henceEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

and thus

2v
[Note that Fig. 75 is drawn in perspective, so that the elements Mm = mn = mν , and the
force normal to mn acts in this manner as previously shown for centripetal forces in a
plane.]
The third force is normal to each of those set up on mn and ms, thus in order that its
direction is along the normal mt to the plane Mr. This force neither impedes the actions of
the preceding forces, nor is it allowed itself to be impeded by their actions. Therefore the
whole effect of this force is to draw the body away from the plane Mr; the body is drawn
from that plane from ν to μ , thus so that the plane νmμ is normal to the plane Mr, and the
angleνmμ is the result of this force. Therefore from the same argument that we put in
place for the preceding force, by evaluating the force in the same way, if this force is M,
then it is given by :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

sin .νmμ = M .Mm .
2v
page 490
Therefore these three forces likewise have the effect that the body, after it has
described the element Mm moves to the element mμ , with an increase in speed clearly
corresponding to the height v + T .Mm. Moreover, any other forces acting on the body can
also be resolved in this way into the forces, the directions of which lie along the
directions mn, ms, mt. As we have determined the effect of these forces on the body, so
[p. 341] likewise the effect of any forces can also become known. Q.E.D.
Corollary 1.
803. By taking νμ in the plane nr π , and by sending a perpendicular μρ from μ to the
plane APQ, μρ is parallel to rn itself. Therefore the three coordinates for the points M,
m and μ are AP, PQ, QM; Ap, pq, qm, and Aπ , πρ , ρμ .
Corollary 2.
804. Whereby if from μ the perpendicular μη is sent to mv, it is normal to the plane Mr;
and likewise in a similar manner ρθ , which is perpendicular to qr, is normal to the same
plane. On account of which, as ρ and μ on the line ρμ put parallel to this plane, then we
have ρθ = μη and θη = ρμ .
Corollary 3.
805. If the normal qT is drawn to Qq in the fixed plane APQ, this line qT is normal to the
plane Mr. Therefore since mt is also normal to the same plane, then mt is parallel to qT;
and between these the distance is the height mq.

Corollary 4.

806. The three coordinates are called AP = x , PQ = y and QM = z .
And we have :
Pp = pπ = dx , pq = y + dy , qm = z + dz
and
πρ = y + 2dy + ddy and ρμ = z + 2dz + ddz = θη.

[Thus, the length mμ is compounded from the lengths pπ or dx in the x-direction,

ρμ − qm = z + 2dz + ddz − z − dz = dz + ddz , in the z-direction; from which the length
corresponding to mμ is extracted by a binomial expansion.]
Corollary 5.
807. Since mq , θη and rν are parallel to each other, in the same plane and terminated by
the lines qr and mν , then

809. Therefore from the three given forces T, N and M that the body is acted upon, there
arises the three following equations :
and
from which the speed of the body at individual points as well as the curve itself becomes
known. [p. 343]

810. The two latter equations joined together with v eliminated give this equation :
For which, the nature of the surface in which the curve described by the body lies, can be
assumed to be expressed by the equation,.
Scholium.
811. Therefore from this proposition we can deduce the first rules, from which the motion
of a body acted on can be deduced, in order that it does not move in the same plane.
Indeed we have shown that all the forces can be resolved in terms of three, the effects of
which we have determined ; and thus, whatever forces are proposed to be acting,
whatever motion they produce on the body can become known. Indeed it is apparent, if
the [second normal] force M is not present, then the motion of the body is entirely in its
own plane, which does not concern us here. But if the tangential force T vanishes with the
forces M and N left, then the body describes a non planar orbit, but yet is still carried
around uniformly. From which the position of the orbit is generally known, and it is
necessary to find the intersection of this inclined plane, in which the elements Mm
and mμ are present, with the plane APQ. [The task of the next proposition.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
812. To determine the inclination of the plane, in which the elements Mm and mμ (Fig.
76) described by a body have been placed, relative to the fixed plane APQ and to find the
line of intersection of the two planes. [p. 344]
SOLUTION.
In the plane, of which we seek the inclination, the three points M, m and μ are given;
therefore in this plane a certain line is placed of which the points pass through both
planes. [This is the element mM ; the plane APQ can be considered as horizontal while
the eye looks down and sees the plane containing QM, the z coordinate, rising vertically,
as in the previous proposition. The point μ arises as previously due to the actions of the
forces M and N, and the lines mM and mμ define a plane, which is tangential to the
surface on which the body moves.] Whereby if the line mM is produced, then it meets the
line qQ [both in the plane APQ] produced in S, while the point S then lies in the plane
Mmμ as well as in the fixed plane APQ; therefore the line formed by the intersection of
the two planes passes through S. Therefore with the lengths remaining as before: AP = x,
PQ = y and QM = z and with the elements of the abscissa Pp and pπ equal to each other,
then qm − QM : Qq = QM : QS and hence :
For the position of the line QS is known from the angle PQS, the sine of which is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

In addition, the point n is also situated in the plane Mmμ ; on account of this the line
passing through n and μ or drawn parallel to this passes through M extant in the same
plane. Moreover this line crosses the plane APQ in the point R of the line QP produced,
and QR is known from this ratio rn − ρμ : rρ = QM : QR ; hence we have

Again from these, the tangent of the angle POR is equal to
[Note that the numerator of PO can be factored to give dx( zddy − yddz ) , which cancels
with the numerator of PR above to give the simpler expression shown];
thus the position of the intersection RO of the plane Mmμ with the fixed plane APQ is
known.[On the annotated diagram, the distance AO along the fixed axis AP is known, and
the angle θ to AP has been found.] Moreover, the mutual inclination of these planes is
found by sending the perpendicular QV from Q to RS ; for then the tangent of the angle
MQ
of inclination is equal to QV . Indeed [as the right triangles RVQ and RPO are similar]
this becomes :

Corollary 1.
813. If the angle POR is always the same, then
and the tangent of the angle is equal to α. This equation on integration gives
αdx + dy + βdz = 0 and αx + y + βz = f .
[Note that β is defined in the next cor.] From which equation it is known that the whole
orbit described by the body lies in the same plane in this case.
Corollary 2.
814. If indeed it is the case that αx + y + β z = f , then
αdx + dy + βdz = 0 and ddy + βddz = 0.
Hence we have :
ddy
[on substituting β = − ddz into the equation for PO above, and simplifying,]
and because − dy − βdz = αdx , then
and likewise AO is constant.
Corollary 3. [p. 346]
815. Again with the angle POR remaining constant or αx + y + β z = f , then the tangent
of the angle of inclination of the planes Mmμ and APQ is equal to :
Whereby this angle itself is constant.

Corollary 4.
816. For neither can the point of intersection O be put as invariable, unless likewise the
orbit described by the body becomes a plane. For let AO = f and putting x − f = t [= OP]
and dx = dt , then: [from the expression
set equal to t, we have]
and hence
This is multiplied by t, from which it is found that :
Which equation can be integrated, in account of dt being constant; for it becomes
This divided by tt and integrated gives :

Corollary 5.
817. But if the tangent of the angle of inclination of the planes Mmμ and APQ is
constant, an equation of the kind αx + y + βz = f is not produced. And elsewhere it has
been shown that the orbit described by the body is then not by necessity a plane.
Corollary 6.
818. Whereby, with the curve described by the body not being planar, then neither the
point O nor the angle POR can be take as invariable. Moreover if these are variables, then
no more can the angle between the planes Mmμ and APQ be considered as constant. [p.

Corollary 7.
819. The line of intersection RO, which is called the line of the nodes in astronomy, if it
does not have a constant position, turns about the point S. For the element mMS has been
put in the plane of the elements Mm from the preceding argument. Whereby the
intersection of RO and the preceding line cross over each other at S.

From which the position of the point S is known.
Corollary 9.
821. If the point S is put invariable, then
xdz − zdx = adz and zdy − ydz = bdz ,
hence it is found that x − a = α z and y − b = β z . Therefore in this case the orbit
described by the body is not only planar, but also it is a straight line, since the projection
of Qqρ gives a straight line in the x-y plane, and since y − b = βz , Mmμ is also a straight
line in the y-z plane.
Scholion.
822. Now from the principles established, which are concerned with the non planar
motion of a body on a surface, the description itself can be divided into two parts as
before with regard to motion in a plane. In the first of these we instruct how to find the
curve described by a body from given forces, and in the second truly it is shown, if the
curve is given which the body describes, what kind of forces are required to do this. Here
only the curve itself needs to be given, or likewise also the speed of the body at
individual points. [p. 348]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

PROBLEM.
823. If a body is acted on by three forces, of which the directions Mf, Mg and MQ (Fig.
77) are parallel to the three coordinate axes AP, PQ and QM, to determine the motion of
the body and the orbit in which it moves.
SOLUTION.
Since Mf and Mg are parallel to AP and PQ, the plane fMg is parallel to the plane
APQ. In this plane, Mi is drawn parallel to the element Qq; and this line Mi is also placed
in the [vertical] plane Mq. A perpendicular Qd is sent from Q to the element mM
produced; and from f and g the perpendiculars fi and gk are sent to Mi. Then from i and k
the perpendiculars ib and kc fall on Md. Moreover fi and gk are perpendicular to the
plane Mq, since the plane fMg is normal to the plane Mq. Now with AP = x, PQ = y and
QM = z remaining as before, let the force pulling the body along Mf be equal to P, the
force which pulls along the body along Mg is equal to Q, and the force pulling along MQ
is equal to R. Therefore these forces, in order that their effect can become known, must
be resolved into forces acting along the tangent Mm, placed along the normal to Mm in
the plane Mq, and normal to the plane Mq.
Since the angle Mfi =Qqp it is the case that

acts, then by (802) :

to :

829. From the resolution of forces into three forces that we have considered in this
proposition, it is easily seen how all forces which can be devised can generally be
reduced. Whereby, with these forces given, it is not difficult to find the curve described
by the body, also for whatever cases are proposed this theorem has the maximum
usefulness.

830. If a body is always acted on by a force towards the axis AP along the perpendicular
MP dropped to the body (Fig. 78), then it is required to find the motion of the body.

AP = x, PQ = y and QM = z then MP =
( y 2 + z 2 ) . Let the force acting along MP be
equal to V and that is resolved into two
components acting along MQ and Mg, where
Mg is parallel and equal to PQ [p. 352].

833. It is appropriate to use examples in order that this can be explained most clearly. On
account of which we produce some, in which the force V is made to depend on the
distance MP, and that we put proportional to some power of the distance MP, for which
it is possible to compare this motion with the motion in a plane [p. 353] arising from a
centripetal force in proportion to a certain power of the distance. There is a great
similarity between these cases [and those previously considered], as if the centre of force
in the plane has its place taken by the axis of the force to which the body is attracted. And
if the body is thus initially projected, so that it does not progress along the axis AP, then
the motion of the body is in the plane PQM, and the body is always attracted to the point
P, the centre of force.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

AP. Then since dx = pdy, it is the case that dx =

projection of the curve sought in the x, y plane APQ. And thus this is the curve of the sine

Which is the equation of the projected curve described in plane normal to the axis AP ;
that can therefore be recalled as the section of a cone, of which either focus is in the
position of the axis AP.
Scholium 2.
836. From these it is understood that the projections of the curves described in the plane
normal to the axis AP are congruent with the curves that bodies describe in that plane
with the same force acting. Moreover, neither is this wonderful ; for the motion, that we
consider in place of this, can be reduced to the motion in a plane made normal to the axis
AP by a body always attracted to the axis, provided the plane is considered to move with
a uniform speed along the axis AP. And for this progressive motion, since it is made
uniformly in direction, it is unable to disturb the motion of the body in the plane. Now
from this arrangement it can be deduced from (827) where, if the force P vanishes, the
motion of the body [p. 355] has been shown to progress along the axis uniformly. On
account of which just as the force P becomes zero, then also the motion sought can be
reduced to the motion in the plane. Clearly this can only happen, if a backwards motion
of such a size can be imparted to the plane normal to the axis AP, as that found for the
progressive motion along AP (827).
Scholium 3.
837. Yet meanwhile this fact does merit the most attention, that we have found with so
much ease in the examples proposed, the equations between the orthogonal coordinates
for the projections of the curve on the plane normal to the axis AP, and thus for the
curves described by the body if the progressive motion should disappear. For in the first
part of this chapter, in which we considered the motion generated in the plane by a
centripetal force, the labour involved much more work and the comparison of the arcs of
circles, in order that we could arrive at the ordinary equations for the curves described.
Therefore with the greater generality, which most often results in increased difficulty in
finding the solutions to questions, it is not an impediment in this case, but rather the
solutions can be easier found in particular cases that had been felt more difficult to solve.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

ydz − zdy b

the cotangent of the angle POR varies as QM. And then the tangent of the angle of
inclination of the plane Mmμ to the plane APQ is equal to

839. Since the case in which the force P vanishes can be reduced to motion in a plane, so
also the case in which either Q or R disappears can be reduced to motion in a plane. For if
the axis is taken on a line normal to AP in the plane APQ, then the force Q lies in a
direction parallel to the axis and the remaining forces P and R now act as Q and R before.
But if the axis is taken normal to AP and to the plane APQ, then the force R takes the
place of the force P parallel to the axis. Clearly as the coordinates x, y and z are able to
be commuted with respect to each other, so also similarly the order of the forces P, Q and
R can be declared.

PROBLEM.
840. If a body is acted on at individual points M (Fig. 79) by two forces, the first in the
direction MA, and the other, the direction of which is MQ along the normal sent from M
to the plane APQ, then it is required to determine the motion of the body M and its orbit.
SOLUTION.
With MP drawn, which is the normal to AP,
the force MA is resolved into forces acting along
Mf parallel to AP and the other along MP. Truly
the force along MP can be resolved into forces
acting along [p. 357] MQ and Mg. Therefore with
AP = x, PQ = y and QM = z put as before, and the
force pulling along MA equal to V and the force
along MQ equal to W and with the resolution of
the forces put in place and with a comparison
made with Prop. 100 (823) it is found that

850. The application to finding the value of z and the inclination of the orbit is very
difficult on account of the imaginary quantities occurring in turn. On this account we are
unwilling to tarry longer with the intersections of the curve described by the body with
the plane APQ, to be determined. Moreover since this is the great question of the
moment in astronomy in finding the motion of the nodes, the following proposition has
been designated to this business, in which, we investigate when the body by its own
motion shall arrive in the plane APQ. For the body completes part of its motion above the
plane, and part below; and whether it is above or below, the body is always drawn from
the other towards this plane by a force W in the direct ratio of the distance from this
plane. Truly the point in the plane APQ, through which the body passes from the upper
part to the lower part, is called the descending node, and the point in which it reverts to
the upper, is called the ascending node.
PROPOSITION 103.
PROBLEM.
851. If the body is always attracted partially to some fixed point A (Fig. 79) in the ratio
of the distances from the same, and partially normally to the plane APQ in the ratio of
the given distances from this plane as well; it is required to determine the nodes or the
points in which the body arrives at this plane, and besides also the points, [p. 363] at
which the body is at a maximum distance from the plane.
SOLUTION.
With the three coordinates x, y and z remaining as before, and the force, by which the
body is drawn towards A , is equal to
( x2 + y2 + z2 )
; and the force, by which the body is
f
drawn towards the plane APQ , is equal to gz and on putting
f +g
= m 2 it is evident that
g
the body is incident in the plane APQ, when z = 0. But z = 0, as often as
(847). This comes about whenever u =∝ , by (846). Therefore since, by (845)
with centre A the circle BQC is described (Fig. 80) with radius AB = c and the body is
moving along the region BQC and in place of this equation, this equivalent equation is
taken [multiplying by c changes the angles into arcs]:EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

The integral of which is

, and
m
expresses the arc BQ, the sine of which is AP = x. [Thus, the integrals are taken to
represent the arcs of which the angles arctan and arcsin of add up to one right angle.] Let
C be the arc BQC or the quadrant of the circle, and the tangent CS = cu
, to which there
m
corresponds the arc CR. Hence the above equation is changed into this:
1 CQR = CQ and CR = m.CQ. From this, it is evident that u =∝ , [p. 364] if the angle
m
CAR is right, or equal to 3, or 5, or 7, etc. right angles. And thus as a consequence, the
motion of the body has an infinite value of u, if the arc CR is made successively into the
degrees of the following sequence of degrees, with the values [corresponding to up or
down in the diagram in turn] :
90, − 90, − 270, − 450 , − 630 etc.
Moreover then the arc CQ contains the degrees :

construction kept in place that avoids putting u = 0, then u is zero as often as CR = 0 or –

Therefore the maximum distance of the body from the plane APQ is equally distant from
the nearest node on each sides. Thus demonstating the second part of the proposition. [p.

Corollary 1.

852. Therefore the nodes finally return to the same point, if m is a rational number or
f +g
f +g
is a square number. But if g is not a square number, then the body is never
g
incident at the same point in the plane APQ , in which before it was finally incident.
Corollary 2.
853. If g is a positive number or the body is always attracted to the plane by a positive
force, then m is a number greater than one. Therefore the interval between the two nodes
is less than an angle of 180 degrees. Whereby the nodes are progressing backwards, and
the distance of a node from the position of the previous node is distant by the angle
180( m −1 )
degrees.
m
Corollary 3.
854. If the body is always repelled from the plane APQ, then g becomes a negative
number m =
g− f
. Whereby if g > f , then m is a real number, but less than unity ;
g
therefore then the nodes as a consequence are progressing more quickly by the amount
which f is less distant than g. And if f = g, then the body escapes from the node and
never returns to the surface APQ . But if f > g, then the body always departs form this
plane. [p. 366]
Corollary 4.
855. Since the body is at a maximum distance from the plane APQ, when it is true that
the maximum distance itself can be had, if this is substituted in the value of z found
(847). Moreover this maximum distance is equal to 2k , which is therefore the same

everywhere.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 5.
856. If this circle BQC (Fig. 80) were the projection of the orbit described by the body in
the plane APQ, then the tangent of the angle of inclination of the plane of the orbit to the
2
plane APQ is equal to 2m k in the places where the body is at a maximum distance from
c −1
2
this plane, or equal to 2mc k with k put in place of
k , since the constant k must avoid
−1
having imaginary values. [An imaginary value of k has to be assumed initially.]
Corollary 6.
857. With the same hypothesis kept for the places, where the body is incident in the plane
APQ, the tangent of the angle of incidence is equal to
dz ( c 2 − k 2 )
with the equality
cdx
Thus this tangent becomes equal to
and with the value of z put in place from (847) this is equal to 2mkc −1 ,
[p. 367] or with a suitable value put in place of k this tangent becomes equal to 2mk
.

Corollary 7.

858. Therefore the tangent of the angle of inclination of the orbit described by a body to
the plane APQ, if the body is at a maximum distance from the plane APQ, is to the same
tangent, if the body is incident in this plane, as m to 1. Therefore the ratio can be made :
as the separation of the two nodes is to 180 degrees, thus the inclination of the orbit, if the
body is at a maximum distance from the nodes, to the inclination of the orbit described
by the body, if the body changes from one node to the other.

859. Indeed this proposition is seen to have some use in astronomy, because there that
force, by which the body is attracted to the fixed point A, we can make proportional to the
distance, truly for celestial bodies that have in place a force that is inversely proportional
to the square of the distance. Yet this is extremely useful, if the orbits of bodies do not
depart much from circles; for there is no interest in orbits that depart from circles, in
whatever way the centripetal force depends on the distances. On account of which, when
the orbits of planets do not depart greatly with circular orbits, this proposition [p. 368] is
able to be adapted successfully to this motion. And it then becomes most useful, as the
curve corresponding to f can be found, which can itself be to the distance from the centre
as the force of gravity to the centripetal force. The other force, which draws the body to
the given plane, is effective as some proportional of the distance; yet if that does not happen, then the letter g must be considered as a variable, from which truly the
approximate motions of the nodes can be gathered from all the values of g, by choosing
as it were the mean value. In lunar motion the motion of the nodes merits special
attention, clearly which will happen to be nearly our preceding determination. Moreover
it is observed from the opposition of the preceding node that the nodes differ by nearly
43', thus in order that
