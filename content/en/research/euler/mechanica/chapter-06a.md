PROPOSITION 104. THEOREM.

860. If a body is moving in a medium with resistance acted on by some number of
absolute forces, the resistive force does not disturb the action of the other absolute
forces in any way, except that the tangential force arising from that is diminished.

DEMONSTRATION.

From the last chapter it has been explained well enough that all absolute forces
can be resolved into two forces, the tangential and the normal, if the motion is to be in the
same plane. But if the body does not move in the same plane, then three equivalent forces
can be assigned in place of any number of forces acting, of which one is the tangential
and two are normal. But the force that the resistance exerts on the body, is always put to
agree with the direction of the body (117). On account of which the resistive force has to
be referred to the tangential force that it diminishes, [p. 370] since the motion of the
body is slowed down, and indeed it does not in short affect the normal forces. Therefore
it is evident that the resistance has no effect on the absolute forces, except in as much as
the tangential force arising from these is diminished by the resistance. Q.E.D.

Corollary 1.

861. Therefore the whole effect of the resistance is consistent with changing the speed of
the body and leaves the direction unchanged, except in as much as the action of the
normal force varies with the variation of the speed.

Corollary 2.

862. Therefore except besides by the aid of [normal] absolute forces, it is not possible for
the body to move along a curve, but always to progress along a straight line, while it
loses its motion.

Scholium 1.

863. Therefore in this chapter, in which we treat curvilinear motion, it is necessary that
we consider absolute forces likewise and these are of such a kind that they can be
resolved to give a normal force, and which are different from what we discussed in
Chapter IV. On this account the first force we consider pulls towards a point at an infinite or the direction of this force is always kept parallel to itself. From there we progress to
centripetal forces and to other forces set out in whatever manner. And hence also we
submit to our analysis motions not contained in the same plane, [p. 371] of such kinds as
arise from motion in a resistive medium.

Corollary 3.

864. If the tangential force is T, and either the one normal is N , or the two normals are N
and M , and the force of resistance is R, then the rules containing the effect of these forces
that we gave in the previous chapter are also to be applied here, except that we put T – R
in place of T for these.

Scholium 2.

865. As the force of the resistance is made to depend on the speed of the body, it is
necessary to be explained by a rule for the resistance, and the explanation has been
widely set out in Chapter IV. Truly in this chapter a wide range of resistances are
uncovered to be treated, which did not find a place in that previous chapter. Besides, this
treatment thus has been subdivided, in order that at first we can determine the curve
described and the motion of the body, from the given absolute forces and the resistance.
Then if the curve and the absolute force is given, from these we deduce the resistance.
Following this, in the third place, from the given curve and the resistance the absolute
force in a given direction is to be investigated. Then from the given curve, with both the
speed of the body at individual points and the resistive force, the absolute force and its
direction can be found. But in the first part of this chapter [p. 372] the division of motion
in coplanar and non-coplanar parts is agreed upon.

PROPOSITION 105.
PROBLEM.

866. If a body is moving in a medium with some resistance and is acted upon by some
absolute forces, yet thus, so that the motion is completed in the same plane, to define the
rules that the body observes in its motion.

SOLUTION.

The body describes the curve AMB on account of the
forces acting (Fig.81); let the speed of this at the point M
correspond to the height v and the element of the curve
Mm = ds. Again the normal force is put equal to N, and
hence the direction of this force is along the normal MN
to the curve, truly the tangential force arising from the
same absolute forces is equal to T, the direction of which
is MT, the tangent of the curve at M. And the force of the
resistance at M is equal to R. With these put in place, the
motion of the body can be defined from the normal force
N and from the force along the tangent T – R (864). Now
let the radius of osculation at M be equal to r and soEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

(552). From these two equations if v is eliminated, the equation is produced expressing
the nature of the curve, and likewise the speed of the body at individual points can be
observed from the equation N = 2rv . Q.E.I. [p. 373]
Corollary 1.
867. Therefore there arises v = Nr

placed in the equation dv = ( T − R )ds in place of dv and in R is put Nr

the equation for the curve described by the body is produced.
Corollary 2.
868. If in R v should have a single dimension, since that comes about if the resistance is
proportional to the square of the speed, then the equation dv = ( T − R )ds is able to be
separated and each force can be determined from that. And this equation solved with
v = Nr
gives a simpler equation for the curve described.

Scholium.

869. Besides this case, in which v has a single dimension in R, many others are given, for
which the equation dv = ( T − R )ds can be integrated; but there is no need to explain
these, as v is eliminated in any case. Truly we have noted the case for this particular idea,
since in fact it pertains to the resistance of fluids and which therefore we will examine
with more care before the others.

PROPOSITION 106.
PROBLEM.

870. The force acts normally everywhere to the given line in the position AP (Fig.82) and
the body moves in a medium with some resistance [p. 374] ; it is required to determine
the curve AMB in which the body moves, and the motion of the body.

SOLUTION.

Let the force which acts on the body at
M be equal to P, the direction of which is
therefore MP. The speed of the body at
M corresponds to the height v and the
force of the resistance there is equal to R.
The element Mm is taken, and with mp
drawn then AP = x, PM = y and Mm =
ds. Then we have Pp = Mr = dx and mr =
dy. Again the tangent MT is drawn, and on that the perpendicular PT from P is drawn. With these done, the force P is resolved

Moreover since this tangential force retards the motion of the body, the negative value of
this must be taken. Therefore with the radius of osculation at M put equal to r then we

874. If both the force and the resisting medium is constant and the direction of the force
is along the direction MP (Fig.82) normal to the given line AP, and the medium has a
resistance in the ratio of the square of the speed, to determine the motion of the projected
body.

SOLUTION.

The force pulling the body towards AP is
always equal to g, and the exponent of the
resistance is equal to c, and the rest of the
denominated terms remain as before.
Therefore we have : P = g and R = vc . Hence
there arises the following equations :

which suffices to construct the described curve. Indeed the equation of this integral is :
Truly with dx

simpler form. Q.E.I.

there is produced the

Corollary 2.

876. Let the sine of the angle, that the curve at A makes with the axis AP be equal to μ,
and the cosine of this is equal to ( 1 − μ 2 ) = v and the height corresponding to the speed
at A is equal to b. Therefore by taking s = 0 and ds : dx = 1 : v there becomes v = b;
s
therefore there is had from e c v = ads2 this equation v 2b = a , thus recognised to be a

877. Again in the final equation of the curve by taking s = 0 and ds : dx = 1 : v and
1+ μ
ds : dy = 1 : μ the constant is found : C = gc + μb + ν 2b l v . Whereby for the curve
described there arises this equation :
Indeed in order that the speed can be found, this equation is brought into use:


Corollary 4.

878. If D is the maximum point, then there dx = ds and dy = 0. Therefore:
From which the equation is found [p. 378]
Truly the height corresponding to the speed that the body has at D, is equal to
Corollary 5.

879. If the curve at B is put to have the same inclination to the axis AP, that is has at A,
then the ratio is ds : dx : dy = 1 : ν : − μ . Hence therefore this equation comes about :
from which there is produced:
Corollary 6.

880. From the construction of the curve it is also easy to deduce from the equation :
dsddy = cd 3 y . For on putting dy = pdx , there arises dpdx ( 1 + pp ) = cddp . Again there
dp
becomes dx = q , since ddx = 0
dpdq
ddp = q ,
hence this equation is produced:
dp ( 1 + pp ) = cdq and q = 1c dp ( 1 + pp ) .

And to these there corresponds :
Hence it is understood that a negative quantity has to be taken for g.

Corollary 7.

881. If the body at A is projected along the direction of
AP (Fig.83) and the force acts downwards, [p. 379] then
the whole curve AM described by the body falls below
AP and y or PM becomes negative ; and since μ = 0 and
ν = 1 , this equation is had for the curve AM (877) :
Corollary 8.

882. Therefore given the tangent at some point M for the inclination to the line AP or the
ratio between ds, dy, and dx, it is possible from this equation to find the length of the arc
AM.

883. Experiments have shown that air resists bodies as the square of the speed. Therefore
since the force of gravity is uniform and air at not very great heights keeps almost the
same density, the case of bodies projected in air is first referred to this proposition. We
therefore determine first the curve that a ball describes projected by a gun or cannon, or
by any other means. Commonly a parabola is taken for this curve, which clearly is the
trajectory in a vacuum, and the air is supposed to be so fine a fluid that it does not merit
to be included in the calculation. Indeed, at any rate, a large body projected with a small
speed is insensitive to the resistance of the air. But the trajectory departs the greatest
distance from a parabola, if a very small body is projected by a large force. Moreover in
these cases, even if here the trajectory has been correctly assigned, it is very painful, as
the equation is so involved that hardly any practical use can be extracted from it. [p. 380]
Newton in the Phil. Princ. did not touch this problem1 and no one after him attempted it,
then John Keil [Sav. Prof. Astronomy Oxford at the time] challenged Johan Bernoulli to
this problem, although he had not been able to find a solution himself. Moreover a
solution was given, not only by Johan Bernoulli2 in Acta Eruditorum Lips. 1719 in the
May issue, but also at nearly the same time Jacob Hermann3 had inserted a solution in his
Phoronomiae. But the following problem, in which the resistance is put proportional to
the speeds, had been solved, first by Newton4 in Phil. Princ. and then by Huygens in
Tractatu de causa gravitatis.

[1. Indeed it was presented by Newton, in Philosophiae naturalis, Book II, Section 2,
Concerning the motion of a body, in which the resistance is proportional to the square of the speed of the body, but the problem in which the orbit was to be found, had been omitted.

PROPOSITION 108. PROBLEM

884. If the resistance of the medium were as the speed of the body and the direction of
the force along MP (Fig.82), and in addition the force is uniform as is the resistance, it
is required to determine the curve that the body describes and the speed at individual
points.
SOLUTION.
With the force put uniform and equal to
g as in the preceding proposition, with the
exponent of the medium resistance equal
to c, with the height corresponding to the
speed at M equal to v, AP = x, PM = y
and the arc AM = s , the normal force is as
before :
gds 2 + 2vddy = 0,
with dx taken as constant. For the
tangential force, on account of the resistance truly in this case equal to
v

is had :
dv = − gdy − ds v . [p. 381]
c
With these equations solved together as in (872), where we put q = c and m = 12 , it is
found that :
and hence :

Thus for the curve described there comes about this equation :
the integral of which is

Thus likewise v is agreed upon from the equation :

885. This differential equation of the third order can immediately be produced for the
gds 2
curve described, if from the equation v = − 2ddy , and with the differential of this :
the values are substituted in the equation dv = − gdy − ds v . For there arises :

Corollary 2.

886. If the body at A is projected with a speed corresponding to the height b and the sine
of the angle that the tangent at A makes with AP is equal to μ, and the cosine of this is
( 1 − μ 2 ) = ν , then at the point A, b = a 2 , or a = 4v 2b , from which the indefinite

888. Therefore this differential equation is found for the curve described :
From which is deduced :
Whereby, since
there is finally found :

Corollary 5.

889. Moreover the equation of the integral for the curve sought is :
From which the construction of the curve by the logarithm is easily completed.
Corollary 6.
890. Also the time, in which the arc AM is completed, is easily defined. For since
ds = 2 dx c , the time for the arc AM is equal to :
v
2v bc − x

Corollary 7.

891. It is also apparent from the equation for the curve to have that asymptote AM . For
since x is unable to be greater than 2ν bc , if we take AE = 2ν bc , the applied line [i. e.
the y co-ordinate] at E = − ∝ and likewise this is taken as the asymptote of the curve
AMDB. This is also understood from the time, [p. 383] since it will be made infinite,
before the body arrives at the perpendicular drawn through E.

Corollary 8.

892. The maximum point D is found by making dy = 0. Moreover, then it is found that
Then, since at D, ds = dx and 2ν bc − x =
speed at the point is equal to
2vgc b
, the height corresponding to the
μ b+g c
v 2 g 2bc
and the speed at D is equal to
( μ b + g c )2
Corollary 9.
893. Truly the applied line CD of the distance of the point D from the axis AP is equal to
and the time, in which the body arrives at D from A, is equal to
Scholium.
894. Therefore it is possible to reduce the case in which the body is projected obliquely
from A, to the case, in which it is projected normally to the force from D. For with the
speed known, with which the body is projected from A, and from the direction of
projection, the point D can be found at which the tangent is parallel to AC, and the speed
of the body at D. Whereby to improve our understanding of this motion, it is expedient to
consider the motion as beginning at D, that we have added as the following last

describes and to find the motion of the body on this curve.
SOLUTION.
Since this proposition is a special case of the
preceding, all the derivations remain as before.
Moreover y or the applied line PM becomes negative,
since the curve AM falls below AP, and we have
μ = 0 and ν = 1. Therefore with the force g acting, with c

this differential equation is found for the curve AM :

and the time in which the arc AM is traversed is equal to 2 c l 2 zbc .

Corollary 4.

899. Therefore the point E through which the asymptote EF passes is as far as the body
that has been sent from the point A can reach, if there is no aid to the force g acting,
before all the motion has been made available. And likewise in a similar way it is
apparent that the time to pass through AM is equal to the time to pass along AP with the
force g vanishing. [p. 386] Hence it is understood from this that g is not present in the
expression for the time.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

911. If the resistance is put in the ratio of the square of the speed, the unknown exponent
of the resistance taken as q, then R =

912. By introducing the radius of osculation r to the determination of q, we have
It consequently becomes :
Therefore with a known radius of curvature r then R as well as q can be found from a first

Corollary 5.
912. If the curve AM is a parabola, the axis of which is the vertical AC, since in that case
d 3 y = 0 , the resistance produced R = 0. From which it is understood that a parabola can
be described in a vacuum by a constant force acting downwards, as it agrees with this.

of the resistance becomes :

915. I will not add other examples of curvature here which can be put in place of AM;
but I am resolved to examine these of merit more carefully in the following propositions.
Moreover I intend to consider in particular the circle and the hyperbola, that these men
cited have treated especially.


PROPOSITION 112.
PROBLEM.

916. With the absolute force g constant and always acting downwards, to determine the
resistance which must be put in place in order that the body is free to move along the
periphery of the circle BAMD (Fig.84). [p. 393]
SOLUTION.
Let the radius of the circle AC = a, then it is the
circle x 2 = 2ay − y 2 and the radius of osculation at M = a
= MC. Whereby since dr = 0 we have the ratio
g : R = 2ds : 3dy .
Indeed ds : dy = a : x = AC : QM . On this account,
3 g .QM
g : R = 2 AC : 3QM or R = 2 AC .
Indeed the height producing the speed at M is equal to
gadx
g .QC
= 2 . But if the resistance is put as the square of
2 ds
the speed, then the exponent of the resistance
Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
917. While the body ascends through the arc BA, on account of QM then being negative,
the resistance along BA is also negative; or the motion of the body along BA is
3 g .QM
accelerated by the medium by the tangential force 2 AC .
Corollary 2.
918. Truly the resistance at the point A is zero, since QM vanishes ; therefore the body at
A moves as if in a vacuum. Indeed at the point D the resistance is in the three on two
ratio to the force g. Indeed at B the force is acting up by the same amount.
Corollary 3. [p. 394]
919. Therefore since at B and D direction of the resistive force agrees with the direction
of the force g, the body at B is urged up by a force equal to 12 g ; at A it is pulled
downwards by the force g and at D up again by the force 12 g .EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Corollary 4.
QM
920. Since AC
expresses the sine of the angle ACM with the radius put equal to 1, then
the resistance at M = 32 g sin .ACM or the resistance is everywhere as the sine of the angle
ACM, by which the body declines from A.

Corollary 5.

921. Again
a .QC
is the tangent of the arc MD. Whereby with the resistance put in
AM
proportion to the square of the speed, the exponent of the resistance q is equal to the third
part of the cotangent of the arc AM.

Corollary 6.

922. Since the height corresponding to the speed at M is equal to
g .QC
, then the speed at
2
g . AC
; and B and D the speed is equal to zero. Therefore since the body since the
2
g
body at B is actually forced up again by the force 2 , it is not a wonder that the body at B
A=
begins to move up.

Corollary 7.

923. Therefore the body, so in the quadrant BA as in the quadrant AD, at places equally separated from the point A, has equal speeds. [p. 395] Truly the body is not able to reach
places below the horizontal BD on account of QC being negative, and in which case the
speed would be imaginary.

Scholium.

924. But the direction in which the body progresses when it arrives at D can be easily
gathered from the reported events. For when the speed at D is equal to 0 and the body at
g
D is urged up by the force 2 , it is evident that the body must again begin to move up.
Moreover, it ascends again through the arc DMA in the same manner, in which in the first
g
place it ascends through BA, since at D as also at B, it is urged up by the force 2 . 

Truly this wonderful thing happens in this motion, since the body is at rest at B and is urged up
again and nevertheless moves on the curve, even if it seems to be unaided by any force,
since it is able to change direction as the body accepts to go up at B. But to this argument
I respond to this argument that the force at B is not in a perfectly vertical direction, but
strays an infinitely small amount from the true vertical, since that is sufficient for the
production of the oblique motion. For the direction of the resistance force at B or rather
the accelerating force is present on the element of the periphery of the circle at B, which is not a perfectly vertical straight line, but inclined at an infinitely small angle towards
BC.

Moreover these results of ours agree exceedingly well with these, which the celebrated
Bernoulli gave in the Act. Lips. A. 1713 and which are present in the later editions of
Newton's Princ. Phil. [Book II, Sect. 2, Prop. X.]

In the first edition an error has crept into the solution [p. 396], from which it was concluded that the ratio of g to R was
established to be equal to the ratio AC to QM. But a word of caution from Nicolas
Bernoulli corrected this lapse in the following editions.
