PROBLEM.

925. As before, with the uniform absolute force g put in place and pulling downwards, to
find the force of the resistance which is effective in order that the body can move along
the hyperbola NAM (Fig.85) freely, with the axis CAQ vertical.

SOLUTION.

Let C be the centre of the hyperbola and the transverse
semi-axis AC is equal to a; and the conjugate semi-axis is
equal to c. Putting CQ = t and QM = AP = x then from
the nature of the hyperbola :
c 2t 2 = a 2 x 2 + a 2c 2 .

Moreover taking PM = AQ = y then y = t − a
and dy = dt , d 2 y = d 2t and d 3 y = d 3t .
Truly from the equation we have:
and hence
Again there arises :
From which there becomes :
Consequently the resistance becomes [from (908)]:

Truly with the resistance made equal to the square of the velocity the exponent of the
resistance is given by :

Corollary 1.

926. With the tangent MT drawn, there arises :
Consequently there is produced : [p. 397]

Corollary 2.

927. Since the resistance R is found to be negative, from this it is indicated that it is not
possible for a body to descend along the hyperbola AM in a resisting medium, for it is
required to be moved by the medium. But while the body ascends the arc NA, since ds
becomes negative, then the resistance R is positive. On account of this, if the body is at N,
the resistance is given by R =
3 g .CQ .NT
.
2 AC 2

Corollary 3.

928. From the properties of the hyperbola, we have CQ : AC = AC : CT . Thus the
3 g .NT
resistance at N, or R, = 2CT . Or the resistance R to the absolute force g as 3NT to 2CT.
At the vertex A the resistance hence disappears and then increases, as N is more distant
from A. [p. 398]

931. Since previously with the circle and now with the hyperbola we have noted that the
resistance in the one arc to be made positive and in the other arc to be negative, that is
obtained for all curves put in place with two equal arcs AN and AM around the maximum
point A. [p. 399] Since in general for the arc AM the resistance is given by R =
since in the arc AN ds is negative then at N resistance is given by R = −

2ddy 2
gdsd 3 y
, thus in

order that the resistance at N is the negative of the resistance at M. Whereby, when by the
nature of things being such that the resistance cannot be made negative, by which the
body is accelerated, then it cannot happen that the body describes a curve in a medium
with resistance, which has two similar and equal branches around the maximum point A.
gds 2

Truly the height generating the speed at M is the same as at N; for the value of this, 2ddy
is not changed, even if ds becomes negative. Therefore with curves of this kind thus
considered and due to Newton, so that some might be elicited for which the density of the
resisting medium does not vary much, or which can be treated by our method in which
the exponent of the resistance has everywhere almost the same value and such a curve
can be taken for the trajectory in a medium of uniform resistance without sensible error;
in addition we consider other curves without the vertical diameter, also provided by
Newton, and hyperbolas having vertical asymptotes are curves of this kind, and which
clearly fall closer to the logarithmic curve which is described by a body in a uniform
medium with the resistance in the simple ratio of the speed. In other cases indeed Newton
could not determine the trajectories from the simple hypotheses of resistance, but was
content to assign approximate values. Which arrangement we follow, since the true
trajectories to be given by us are so complicated that hardly any can be deduced in
practice. [p. 400]

[Newton's propositions that correspond to those of Euler, and others, are set out in Book
II, Sections 2 and 3 of the Principia.]


PROPOSITIO 114. PROBLEM.

933. Let the curve NM (Fig.86) be a hyperbola of any other kind having a vertical
asymptote CP, and it is required to determine the resistance which is effective, in order
that the body, always acted on by a downwards force, moves on this hyperbola.

SOLUTION.

The asymptote CP is considered as the axis to
the hyperbola, and from M the normal MP is
drawn. By taking CP = y and MP = x, which
we have generally taken to be the case above,
then these are in position if dx is taken as
negative everywhere. Let RC be the other
asymptote and C the centre of the hyperbola,
and the sine of the angle RCP = α and the
cosine of this angle is ( 1 − α 2 ) = β .
Therefore with PM produced at R,

PR = β and CR = β . From M the line MQ is
drawn parallel to the asymptote CR, and

From these there is produced
which with MT made negative is equal to the resistance R. Thus the resistance is given by

Corollary 5.

938. If the resistance is put to be in proportion to the speeds, in all these hyperbolas the
exponent of the resistance varies directly as CQ, since m = 12 in this case. Therefore for
this hypothesis of the resistance, the body is free to describe all the hyperbolas.

951. From these examples it is clear that a body cannot describe hyperbolas in a medium
with a uniform resistance of this kind, since the exponent of the resistance varies too
much, and which clearly is finally indefinitely large. On account of which Newton's
custom cannot be approved, in which he desired to substitute these hyperbolas in place
of the true trajectories in mediums with uniform resistances. Furthermore, in a medium with the resistance following the square of the speeds, the exponent varies as the tangent
MT, which on descending as far as the point N is to be returned as strongly varying
according to the calculation. Also this other inconvenience must be understood for the
speed, since on descending it becomes infinitely large, when however in a uniform
medium it cannot increase beyond a given final speed. Besides clearly, it is not resolved
for the hypothesis with the resistance proportional to the square of the speed, how the
curve described can have a vertical asymptote, as happens in the case of a medium with
the resistance in the simple ratio of the speed. For this resistance, even if the body has no
force acting on it, the whole motion is along a finite line; which indeed becomes infinite
if the resistance is put as the square of the speed. [p. 405] From which also it follows that
the trajectory in this medium does not have an asymptote. It is not even certain that this
curve has a hyperbolic asymptote [i. e. becomes hyperbolic for large values of the
abscissa.]. Yet meanwhile it can have a vertical asymptote of the other parabolic kind of
curve, which is determined from the quadrature of the curve by rectification of the given
parabola. But leaving the hypothesis of uniform force we may go on to variable force,
yet the direction of this is still everywhere parallel to itself. Indeed we do not investigate
the curve described by a given curve with resistance, as this can now be done by Prop.
106 (870) ; but with a given curve and with one of the force, the resistance, or the speed
given, we can determine the other quantities.

PROBLEM.

952. Let some variable absolute force that acts downwards along MP be given (Fig.87);
to determine the required resistance for this, in order that the body moves along the
given curve AM.

SOLUTION.

Let AP = x, PM = y and the element of the arc AM = ds;
while the force shall be P by which the body at M is
acted upon, and the height corresponding to the speed at
M is v, and the resistance at M is equal to R. With these
put in place, we have (870) dv = − Pdy − Rds and

957. Let the curve AM be a circle, the centre of which is C and the radius AC = a.
Moreover the body is always attracted to the axis AC in the ratio of the distances, thus so

that P = f ; then v = 2 f and thus the speed at M is as the applied line MP. Then the
resistance R becomes equal to
Moreover the speed at the point A is equal to 0 and the
resistance, while the body ascends in the quadrant, is
negative or the body is accelerated by the medium. The time,
in which travels from A to M, is indefinitely large; for it
becomes
This which can also be understood by itself; for since the
y
speed at A is equal to 0 and here as the force f is acting
while the force of the medium vanishes, the body must perpetually remain at A.
Example 2.

958. With the circle AM remaining, if the absolute force varied inversely as the distance

PM or P = y , then v = 2 . Whereby the speed of the body is the same everywhere, or the
body is carried around the periphery of the circle in an equal motion, and the time in
which some arc AM is completed, is as the arc AM itself. But the resistance at M is equal
to :
Therefore the resistance is negative [p. 408] while the body ascends the quadrant ;
moreover while it descends the following quadrant, the resistance becomes positive or is

point A the force of the resistance moving forwards is indefinitely large in order that it is

. Therefore there is
n ; from which [by (956)] dP =

produced from these, v =

Thus the ratio is formed :
Whereby, if n = –3 or the force P varies inversely as the cube of the distance MP, then the
resistance R vanishes and the body from this force acting in a vacuum is able to move in
the circle AM. Then if n + 3 is a positive number, the ascending resistance in the quadrant
is negative. But if n + 3 is a negative number, then the resistance in this quadrant is
positive.
Example 4.
960. If the curve AMB (Fig. 88) is of such a kind that the
radius of osculation at M varies as the reciprocal of the
applied line PM, [p. 409] that all elastic curves agree on,
then

Therefore the speed of the body at the highest point of the circle is equal to zero, and the
force P vanishes at that place. Moreover the body is not able to progress beyond this
point, since otherwise the speed would become imaginary ; thence therefore it retreats to
the point A, as it accelerates due to the negative resistance. Moreover while it arrives at A,
since here the speed is infinitely great, with this motion of its own it describes the
quadrant below AC, in which it is it is acted on by the negative force P upwards. [p. 412]

969. The time in which the body can complete the arc AM or
∫ dsv , is equal to
Therefore with the curve given or the equation between s and x, [p. 413] the time can also
be obtained, even by quadrature. Therefore these curves are the most convenient to solve,
for which there is a given equation between s and x.
Corollary 2.
970. Since a can be taken as a constant of the integration taken as you please, it can be
used to determine either the speed at a given point on the curve or the force acting.
Corollary 3.
971. If the curve AM is concave towards the axis AP, then ddy is negative; therefore in
these cases the force draws the body towards the axis AP. But if the curve is convex
towards AP, since then ddy is positive, then the force P is negative, or the body is
repelled from the axis AP.
Example 1.

972. Let the curve AM be a parabola having the axis standing normally to the right line
AP, of such a kind that is described by a body projected obliquely in a vacuum from A, it
is given by by = fx − x 2 and thus dy = b − 2 xdx
, and ddy = − 2dx
. With these put in
b
b
place, the force acting is given by :

From which it is understood, that the longer the motion is continued, [p. 414] there the
force P decreases more. Moreover with c made indefinitely large, which is the case in a
s
vacuum, then e c = 1 and the force P = 4ba is thus constant.
Example 2.
973. If the curve AM is such that its equation is given by y = αx − βx 2 − γx3 , then
dy = αdx − 2βxdx − 3γx 2dx and d 2 y = −2β dx 2 − 6γxdx 2 .
Hence we have :
At the point A we have:EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Therefore the height corresponding to the initial speed at A is a( 1 + α ) ; which if called
b, then a = b 2 , and α is the tangent of the angle below which the body is projected
1+α
from A. Then from the value of dy , it is found that
Therefore with the remaining terms ignores the arc length becomes :
and which boundaries can also be pushed back if c is made very large. Whereby, when P
is made approximately constant, truly equal to g, it is the case that
And if this equation is assumed : y = αx − β x 2 − γx3 − δx 4 ,
it produces
Therefore we have :
[p. 415] Therefore this curve of the fourth order is very close to the trajectory in a very
rare uniform medium, which has resistance in the ratio of the square of the velocity, and
with a uniform force g acting downwards.
Corollary 4.

974. Since the air resistance is proportional to the square of the speeds, if in air composed
of heavy globules [Euler had the belief at this time that air consisted of globules : see
E002 De Sono in these translations] and the body is projected with a great force, then b et
c are maximum quantities. Whereby it is necessary to take this equation for the projection
of this body :
since the curve differs little from the true trajectory.

975. Let AMDB (Fig. 89) be this trajectory ; in which in order that the point B can be
found, in which the projected body is incident on the horizontal AB, I put y = 0 and the
equation becomes

978. If the sine of the angle, that the curve makes at A with the horizontal AC is set equal

From which equation the value of ε elicited gives the direction for the longest throw.
Moreover from this equation it is found as an approximation [original formula corrected
by Paul St.]
Corollary 9.
979. Therefore the angle, which produces the longest throw, is a little less than half a
right angle, which in a vacuum it makes satisfactorily. For if it becomes
then it produces ε = 12 and thus the half right angle. But as here we have only 5b in the
numerator, the distance becomes less for a short while.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

described in air for projected bodies, which can be put in place without too much
difficulty rather than the parabola, which generally is accustomed to be used. Indeed we
can deduce this same equation from the true equation dsddy = cd 3 y (875) of these
trajectories found above. [p. 419] But since there this reduction was omitted, and here we
have preferred to present this material, particularly since here it is evident that the later
terms of the equation are strongly decreasing. Finally in a like manner too, the curves for
trajectories in mediums with other hypothesis of resistance can be conveniently found;
but since these other hypotheses do not find a place in the world, we will not tarry here
about finding them.

tangent of the arc AM. And if the resistance is proportional to the square of the speed,
then the exponent of this is given by :
Thus q is negative and equal to half the tangent of the arc AM. Moreover when the body
approaches the horizontal AC, then the resistance R and q become positive, or the
medium actually offers resistance.

PROPOSITION 119. PROBLEM.

991. If the medium is uniform and offers resistance in the ratio of some multiple of the
speed, and it is given besides that the body progresses uniformly along the horizontal AP
at a constant speed (Fig.90), to find the force acting downwards and the curve that the
body describes. [p. 422]

SOLUTION.

With AP = x, PM = y, with the arc AM = s, let the
horizontal speed of the body while it is at M
correspond to the height u; the height corresponding
to the true speed of the body at M is equal to
uds 2 = v . Again let the exponent of the resistance of
dx 2
the medium be equal to c and the ratio law of the
2m-multiple of the speed is the resistance

With these in place we have :
(871); for I put ddy in place of –ddy, since in our case y is falling. Then we have :
(cit.). But it is the case that :
Hence on account of dsdds = dyddy we have :
Moreover u is given in terms of x and on account of this ds can be determined from x
only; clearly it is given by :
Thus it is permitted to find the equation for the curve to be found. With this found,
likewise P can become known from the equation : P =
2uddy
. Q.E.I. [p. 423]
dx 2
Corollary 1.
992. Therefore the horizontal motion cannot be uniform; for on account of du = 0 , ds =
0, except in a vacuum when c =∝ , and where it is always by necessity uniform. The
acceleration of the horizontal motion must also be much less also in a resisting medium;
for then ds is either given a negative or imaginary value, which is absurd in each case.
Therefore the horizontal motion must be one of deceleration, by which du is made
negative.
Corollary 2.
993. If the resistance is proportional to the speed itself, then we have m = 12 and the
equation for the curve becomes du c + dx u = 0. Moreover which, since it does not
contain s or y, cannot pertain to the curve. Moreover this equation itself determines the
horizontal motion. It is evident in this hypothesis of the resistance that not any horizontal
motion can be taken as you please, but by necessity that has to be accepted, which is
determined by this equation.


Corollary 3.

994. Moreover that horizontal motion agrees with the horizontal motion along AP in the
same resisting medium, but with no force acting. From which it is understood, if there
were any force acting on the body, then the direction of this force is everywhere in the
downwards direction only [p. 424], in a medium with the resistance in the simple ratio of
the speed always to be the same. Concerning which motion in this hypothesis of the
resistance is similar to the motion in a vacuum, in which the horizontal motion is always
uniform, however the downwards force acting may vary.
Corollary 4.
995. Therefore with an assumed value for this horizontal motion, the other equation
P=
2uddy
can determine the described curve, in which for P we are allowed to assume
dx 2
some quantity. Therefore in this case of the hypothesis of the resistance, this problem is
generally soluble : in order that the curve is found, as the body acted upon by some
downwards force describes.
Corollary 5.
996. Moreover since − du c = dx , then 2 bc − 2 cu = x with the initial speed at A put
u
equal to
b . Therefore the equation becomes :
Hence for the curve described this equation is found :
Corollary 6.
997. Therefore all these curves have a vertical asymptote at the distance 2 bc from the
vertex A. For x cannot be greater than 2 bc , and when the body moves horizontally [p.
425] is unable to progress beyond this boundary, also the body in the wide part of the
curve cannot progress beyond this line.

Corollary 7.

998. If in other hypotheses of the resistance too, the horizontal motion along the curve
AM is taken to agree with the horizontal motion along the line AP with the same
hypothesis of resistance, thus in order that :
and this equation ds = dx is produced for the curve AM, taking P = 0. Therefore that
agreement does not therefore find a place with other hypotheses of resistance.


Corollary 8.

999. Therefore let the resistance vary as the square of the speed, or m = 1. Whereby
ds = − cdu
and by integrating, with the height b put to correspond to the speed at A,
u
s = c l ub . Therefore in this hypothesis of the resistance, the arc AM divided by 2c is equal
to the logarithm of the horizontal speeds at A and M.

Corollary 9.

1000. Therefore in this hypothesis of the resistance, we have u = e − c b. From which there
is produced :
s
, this becomes
[p. 426] Or since ds = − cdu
u
But
Hence we have :
Consequently we have:

Corollary 10.

1001. If this equation is taken between u and x
then
With these substituted, there is produced in the medium with the resistance varying in the
ratio of the square of the speed :


Moreover, this equation is obtained for the curve sought :

Corollary 11.

1002. Therefore in this case u 2n − 2 must be greater than
f 2n
or u greater than
c2
Whereby, if the horizontal motion is able to become less than this quantity, the motion on
the curve does not correspond to the total horizontal motion given. For if the curve is
stretched further, then it could be that dy as well as P become imaginary.

Corollary 12.

1003. To avoid this inconvenience n must be made smaller than unity; therefore making
−1
n − 1 = − k or n = 1 − k . With this in place, we have u k = b k − f k kx. Truly with AP the
tangent to the curve at A here we have ds = dx, and there u = b. Hence we have
Moreover again we obtain

Scholium.

1004. Therefore none of the hypotheses of this kind of the horizontal motion of
trajectories in fluids can be integrated. Indeed whatever the value of k, the force at A,
where we put u = b, is indefinitely great; then truly is decreases for ever. All these curves
also have vertical tangents, where x = kc , which is an asymptote to the curve. Moreover
we assign this problem to the end of the first part of the tract, in which we have put the
direction of the force to be always parallel among themselves, and we progress to
examination of centripetal forces that must soon be considered, in what manner the
resisting medium disturbs the motion of bodies attracted to a fixed point.
