CONCERNING THE CURVILINEAR MOTION OF A FREE POINT IN A RESISTIVE MEDIUM

PROPOSITION 120.
PROBLEM.

1005. A body is always attracted by some force in a medium with some kind of resistance
towards the fixed point C (Fig.91); to determine the curve AM that the body describes
projected in some manner.

SOLUTION

When the body is at M, the distance of this from the
centre MC is equal to y, the element Mm is equal to ds; the
speed at M corresponds to the height v. Also from M the
normal Mr is drawn to mC, and mr = dy. Again with the
tangent MT drawn, let the perpendicular CT = p be sent from
C to that line and the radius of osculation at M is equal to r,
ydy
which is equal to dp . Now let the force which draws the
body at M towards C be equal to P and the force of resistance
at M is equal to R. Moreover by resolving the force P, the
Pp
Pdy
normal force y and the tangential force − ds are produced, since the motion of the
body is retarded. Moreover from the normal force this equation is had (552) :

...

Besides since the tangential force with a small resistance is given by − ds − R , we have
(cit.). From these equations solved together, first the speed at particular points on the
curve, and then the curve itself AM is known. Q.E.I.

[Recall in (910) we gave a sketch for determining the radius of curvature for rectilinear
coordinates; here we repeat briefly the procedure for polar coordinates, illustrating Euler's
amazing grasp of elemental triangles :]

Corollary 1.

1006. On account of the similar triangles Mmr, CMT , we have

...

In which on substitution there is produced :

...


Therefore with v eliminated there is obtained an equation between y et p, which suffices to determine the curve. 


Corollary 2.


1007. Since P = pdy , this value is substituted in the other equation. With this done there is produced
From which equation, if R is a force of v, then the value of v itself can be found.

Corollary 3.

1008. Let the resistance be proportional to the square of the velocity and the medium
2vdp
, which
uniform, thus in order that R = vc . Hence we have therefore dv + p = − vds
c
equation on integrating gives vp 2 = bh 2e− c , where b is the height corresponding to the
initial speed at A and h is the perpendicular from C sent to the tangent at A.

Corollary 4.


1009. Therefore according to this hypothesis of the resistance, since v = bh s , the force
p 2e c
is given by
Therefore when P is given in terms of y, this equation is the equation sought for the
curve [p.430] AM; moreover the speed at any place M varies inversely as the
perpendicular to the tangent and also inversely to the number the logarithm of which is
the path length divided by 2c shown.

Corollary 5.

1010. Therefore according to this hypothesis of resistance, the body describes the same
path acted on by the centripetal force Vs , as it describes in a vacuum acted on by the
ec
force V. For in either case the equation sought for the curve is this : Vdy =
2bh 2 dp
.
p3
Whereby, as the body in this medium with resistance, describes the same curve as the
body in a vacuum, the centripetal force must decrease in the ratio the logarithm of which
is the distance described to the value of c applied.


Corollary 6.

1011. Let the resistance of the proportional speeds be as the 2mth power of the exponent
m
and with the medium uniform, thus in order that R = v m . Therefore we have
c
m
2vdp
dv + p = − v mds . Which integrates to give
c

Corollary 7. [p.431]

1012. Let the resistance be proportional to the speed, or m = 12 , this gives
∫
Moreover pds expresses twice the area ACM, which we take to be S. And taking away
the constant, this gives
with b and h having the same values as in coroll. 3.
Corollary 8.
1013. Therefore in this hypothesis for the resistance, the speed of the body disappears
when the sector of the body or the area completed is equal to h bc . Therefore this area
is of such a size that the body is never able to complete this area. And the speed of the
body at M varies directly as this absolute area of space now made very small, and
inversely as the perpendicular to the tangent.
Corollary 9.
1014. According to the same hypothesis of resistance
Therefore the centripetal force is equal to
Then truly the time, in which the arc AM is completed, is equal to

Hence an infinite time is needed before the body completes the area equal to h bc , or
before all the motion is reduced to zero.

Scholium. 

1015. Therefore these are the general laws obeyed by a body in a resisting medium acted
on by some centripetal force. Moreover I have deduced these further in the cases where
the resistance is proportional to the speed or to the square of the speed, while it is clear
that this cannot be done in other hypothetical cases of resistance; consequently in the
following we take to be our main concern these two resistances that we have been
concerned with up to this stage. Moreover now we take the given centripetal forces as
proportional to powers of the distances, and we investigate what differences resistance
introduces to the curves described. Then just as in the preceding, we put in place the
given curve that arises, together with enquiring about either the centripetal force,
resistance, or speed in the remainder of the motion.

PROPOSITION 121.
PROBLEM.

1016. If the centripetal force varies as some power of the distances from the centre, and
the body moves in a medium with constant resistance, which resists in the square ratio of
the speed, to determine the curve AM (Fig.91) that the body describes, and the motion of
the body on this curve.
SOLUTION. [p.433]
By keeping as before: CM = y, CT = p, Mm = ds, with the speed at M corresponding
to v there becomes :
Hence this equation is found for the curve sought :
However not a lot can be understood from that equation about the curve put in place, on
s
account of the complicating factor e c ; whereby with the logarithms taken, there is
and
on taking dy constant. Since indeed ds =
ydy
( y2 − p2 )
, we have

...

Which is the equation between y and p sought for the curve. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.

1017. From which an equation is produced, if the force is proportional to the distance or
inversely proportional to the square of the distance, that is readily apparent from the
equation found, if 1 or – 2 is substituted in place of n. Moreover all the substitutions of
this kind do not help in bringing about the tractability of the general equation.
Corollary 2.
1018. If the medium put in place is not uniform, but the exponent of this is the variable
ds
q, in place of e c there is put e ∫ q (873) [p.434] and this equation is found for the curve
described :

Where, if q is made proportional to the distance y, the equation can be reduced to a
differential equation of the first degree.
Corollary 2.
y
1019. Therefore let the exponent of the resistance q = α , and the curve described can be
expressed by the following equation :
In which, since the number of dimensions of the individual terms vanishes, reduction to
a differential equation of the first degree can be put in place.
Corollary 3.
1020. Moreover in this manner the differential equation of the first degree is found.
Putting
there is

Corollary 5.
1021. If the centripetal force is put to vary inversely as the cube of the distance, then
n = −3 . [p.435] Hence the curve described is contained in this equation :
Corollary 6.
1022. If the centripetal force varies in proportion to the inverse square of the distance,
then n = −2 . And the curve described is expressed by the following equation :
In the same manner, if the centripetal force is proportional to the distances or n = 1 to be
put in place, there is produced :
Corollary 7.
1023. All these equations give curves in the vacuum if α = 0 is put in place. For in this
case the exponent of the resistance is made infinitely great, and therefore the resistance
infinitely small. Moreover, this equation is found :
Scholium.
1024. Therefore when the exponent of the resisting medium, which is put to resist as the
square of the ratio of the speeds, is proportional to the distances from the centre, then the
equation for the curve described can be reduced to a differential equation of the first
degree ; which is hardly possible to be done for the other hypotheses of the exponents of
the resistance. Moreover I understand that such values of q, which only depend on the
distances from the centre y, are clearly the only ones admitted to be put as a ratio. [p.436]
Indeed it is not fitting to give q in terms of p, i. e. through the curve itself, which is still
unknown. Yet meanwhile the differentio-differential equation can always be reduced to a
first order equation [note that Euler considers differential equations as those written withEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

page 644
single derivatives such as dx, dy, etc; while he considers the ratio of differentials such as
e. g. dy/dx to be the ratio of a differential by a differential], as long as q is given as a
function of a single dimension of y and p taken together. But with these equations, even if
they are differentials of the first order, they are neither able to be separated nor
integrated, and they serve no useful purpose. On this account, we consider the resistance
proportional to the speed when it is joined with a centripetal force to any power of the
distances.
[Thus, there are now three kinds of variables to be considered : the power law
governing the central attraction; the relation of the resistance to the speed; and the form
of the function formed from the exponent of the resistance; only a small portion of these
cases is soluble.]

PROBLEM.
1025. In a uniform medium, which resists in the simple ratio of the speed, the body
moves attracted to the centre C (Fig.91) by a force proportional to some power of the
distance ; the determine the curve AM that the body describes.
SOLUTION.
By putting CM = y, CT = p, Mm = ds, with the speed at M corresponding to the height
v and with the exponent of the resistance equal to q, the centripetal force is equal to

the perpendicular from C sent to the tangent at A. From which S can be eliminated, and
the equation found put in this form :
From which by differentiation with dp put constant there arises :

Which equation expresses the kind of the curve AM described. Truly by knowing this, at
once the speed of the body can become known from the area of the curves and from the
perpendicular p. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
1026. If in place of dp the element dy is assumed constant, then this equation is produced:
Moreover nothing can be concluded from this equation, since it cannot be reduced to a
first order differential equation.
Corollary 2.
1027. The above reduction can always be put in place (1020), if in the differential
equation the indeterminates [p.438] p and y are agreed to have the same number of
dimensions. Moreover, this happens if n = 1, i. e. if the centripetal force is proportional to
the distance from the centre. Then indeed for the curve sought :

1032. I will not delay any more over this equation, although I suspect that it is possible to
be integrated anew. This indeed is certain, if C 2c = − f ; in which case as the integral
is made composite, as here I did not wish to make the change. From which it is
understood that the integral obtained is very complicated, so thus hardly anything could
be deduced about understanding the motion. On which account with these in place I go
on to the inverse problems.

1033. If the curve AM is given (Fig.91) that the body describes, and the resistance is
given at the individual points M, to determine the centripetal force always directed
towards the centre C, and the speed of the body at individual points.
SOLUTION.
As before there are put in place CM = y, Mm = ds, CT = p, with the height
corresponding to the speed at M equal to v, with the resistance equal to R, and the
centripetal force equal to P. With these in place this equation is found :

1036. If the body in a vacuum is moving along the curve AM with the same initial speed
at A, and if the speed that the body has at M is said to be u , and the centripetal force at
M is equal to V, then there arises :
Whereby we have :
Corollary 4.
1037. Therefore since in this problem, in which the curve AM and the initial speed at A is
given, the centripetal force is truly sought, now it is as the solution in the preceding
chapter, and from the same solution likewise this problem is solved. For with
∫ Rp ds found, at once the difference of the centripetal forces in a vacuum and in the
2
resisting medium becomes known, and thus the centripetal force in the resisting medium
itself.
Example 1.
1038. If the curve AM is a circle of radius a having its centre at C and the same resistance
everywhere R equal to a constant λ, then y = p = a and h = a . Whereby there is found :
Therefore the speed is always decreasing and Cleary vanishes with the arc described
equal to λb , in which place also the centripetal force goes to zero. Moreover this
centripetal force is everywhere as the square of the speed. [p.442]Besides the time, in
which the arc AM is traversed, is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

and the time in which the body is returned to rest is equal to λ .

Therefore the resistance is in the n2+n1 − multiple ratio of the speeds with the medium

Corollary 7.
1042. If n = 1, then the resistance is in the ratio of the speeds and the exponent of the

medium is 4 β . Therefore the body can describe a logarithmic spiral in this medium, if
y
the centripetal force is in proportion to the distance, truly equal to 2 βf , and if initially it
is projected from A with the speed

resistance, a spiral can be described by the body, except in the case in which the
resistance is proportional to the square of the speed.

which when it arrives, all the motion has gone and likewise the centripetal force has
vanished. If the resistance is in proportion to the square of the speed, then
Moreover the motion of the body in the periphery of the circle clearly agrees with the
rectilinear motion, in which the motion of the body has been lost by the impressed
resistance. For the centripetal force, which is always normal, clearly does not affect the

1055. Therefore all the cases are contained in this example and adjoining corollaries, in
which the body is able to describe a logarithmic spiral in a medium with some kind of
resistance, acted upon by a centripetal force in proportion to some power of the distance.
Where the case arises, in which the resistance is proportional to the square of the speed
and the exponent varies as the distances from the centre, then in this special case it occurs
that immediately the centripetal force can be given proportional to some power of the
distance, which in other hypotheses of resistance are finally obtained after the
determination of the initial speed in a certain way. Moreover in that hypothesis of the
y
resistance, with the exponent of the resistance being δ , if the body is projected at A with
some speed
b along a direction at an angle of inclination to AC, of which the cosine is
β, and the centripetal force at A is equal to 2ab , then the body always moves in a
logarithmic spiral, [p.451] if in addition the centripetal force varies as y i −3 ; moreover i
is given, since i = δβ . Therefore for these, in which the motion observed is a logarithmic
spiral, the cases have been explained well enough.

If the resistance is in proportion to the square of the speed, the exponent of this is taken
as q, then R = qv et q = Rv . Whereby it is found that :
[p.452] Hence from the given curve or the equation between y and p, we have found the
centripetal force, as well as the resistance R and the speed, at individual points. Q.E.I.

Corollary 1.

1057. The resistance can be expressed in another way :
From which it is evident, if P varies as
dp
, that the resistance vanishes. For indeed in
p 3 dy
this case the centripetal force is sufficient to produce the given curve.

Corollary 2.

1058. With the initial speed at A put equal to b and with the perpendicular sent from C
to the tangent at A equal to h let the centripetal force be equal to V, which can be
produced in the vacuum in order that the body moves along this curve; then it is given by
(591). Hence on this account

Corollary 3.

1059. If the body moves in a vacuum in this curve acted on by the force V , the speed of
2
this at M corresponds to the height u and it becomes u = bh2 . Thus we have this ratio
p
u : v = V : P. And in general this theorem is obtained : the speeds of the body at the same
place M are in the square root ratio of the centripetal forces [in the vacuum and with
resistance]. [p.453]

1060. If the centripetal force is constant or P = g, then we haveEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 1.

Example.
1061. The body descends in an hyperbolic spiral AM, the nature of this is expressed by
this equation :
and if the centripetal force is raised by some power of the distance from the centre of the

spiral C, evidently P =
. There is the equation :
Thus there is produced :
and from these we find :
Therefore if medium resists in the square ratio of the speed, then the exponent of the
resistance is equal to
( a2 + y2 )
. But if the medium resists in the simple ratio of the
n +3
speed, and the exponent of the resistance is q, then we have
Therefore in this hypothesis of the resistance the medium is uniform if n = −1; that is, if
the centripetal force is in the inverse ratio of the distances. For indeed it becomes
2
q = af . But if the centripetal force is inversely as the square of the distances, then the
exponent of the resistance becomes equal to [p.454]
2a 2 y
, or it is in proportion to the
f2
distances themselves from the centre.

1062. Just as here the problem ought to follow our custom, in which the centripetal force
as well as the resistance are sought from the given curve and the speeds at individual
places; but since the solution of this is much easier and from the rules given above
(1007), it immediately becomes soluble and besides from that, nothing noteworthy can
be deduced, and so I pass over this; moreover it is found that which formulae solve the problem. Truly I add in place of this problem another related
problem, in which besides the curve the angular motion around the centre of force is
given and so the centripetal force as well as the resistance is sought.
