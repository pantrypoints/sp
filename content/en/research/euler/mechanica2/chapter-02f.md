THE MOTION OF A POINT ON A GIVEN LINE IN A VACUUM


PROPOSITION 41. Problem.


367. If a body is always drawn downwards by some force, the find the brachistochrone
line AMC (Fig. 46), upon which the body descends the most quickly from A to C.

Solution.

On putting AP = x, PM = y and with the
AM = s, let the force which pushes the body
downwards at M be equal to P; then
v = Pdx and with this integral thus taken
∫
so that it vanishes on putting x = 0, if the
body indeed is put to begin its motion from
rest at A, and dv = Pdx. Hence
du = Pdx = dv and ddw = 0 ,
since du remains invariant in going from m
to n. Therefore this equation is obtained

the integral of which is :

l av = 2l ds or vds 2 = ady 2 ,
and hence :

Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
368. Therefore at A, where the speed of the body disappears, either
∫ Pdx = 0 , and dy = 0,
or the tangent to the curve at A is incident along the vertical at AP. But when it becomes
Pdx = a , there the tangent to the curve is horizontal [as dy/ds = 1 at A].

Corollary 2.

2v = Pdy .

Now ds is the normal force[; in

along the normal drawn towards
the axis AP. Consequently, the
normal force is equal to the
centrifugal force and acting in the
same direction. On account of
which the brachistochrone curve
has this property, that the total
force exerted on the curve is twice
as great as the normal force alone.
Now in the following we will demonstrate that all brachistochrone lines have this
property in place, either in a vacuum or in a medium with resistance. [Thus, the
centrifugal force is the force of the body pressing on the curve due to the motion, which
Pdy
here has the same magnitude as the normal component of the weight ds along IG; thus
Pdy
the curve supplies a total normal force equal to 2 × ds along GI to produce the required
centripetal force.]
Corollary 3.
370. On account of the arbitrary nature of a an infinite number of brachistochrone curves
are given all having the starting point A. And this letter a can be used, so that a curve
from A passes through the point C, which is the line between A and C, upon which the
time is a minimum.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 4.
371. Because the curve AMC (Fig. 47) has a horizontal tangent somewhere, let that be BC
and the other vertical axis CQ is taken at C. Let CQ = X, QM
= Y and CM = S; then dX = −dx , dY = −dy , dS = − dS and
∫ Pdx = a − ∫ PdX with the integral ∫ PdX thus taken, so that
it vanishes on putting X = 0. If the curve is referred to this
axis CQ, this equation is found :
dY =
dX ( a − ∫ PdX )
∫ PdX
or dS = dX a .
∫ PdX
Corollary 5.
333. Therefore all these curves have two similar and equal arcs on each side of the axis
CQ. [p. 181] In a similar manner the curve is equally disposed on each side of the axis
AB. On account of which curves of this kind have infinite diameters parallel to each other
and places at a distance BC, unless perhaps the force acting is therefore taken, so that
above A it is negative, in which case the curve CMA can tend upwards and the concave
part is changed to downwards.
Example 1.
373. Let the force acting be or P = g; the integral becomes
∫ Pdx = gx; thus with gb put in
place of a, this equation is obtained for the brachistochrone for this hypothesis of the
force acting :
dy = dx x
( b− x )
or ds = dx b .
( b− x )
But if the equation is referred to the axis CQ, it becomes
dY =
dX ( b − X )
X
or dS = dX b ,
X
the integral of which is S = 2 bX . From which equation it is clear that the curve is a
cycloid upon a horizontal base described by a circle of diameter b and turned downwards,
as thus found by the most celebrated Johan Bernoulli and by other outstanding geometers
now some time ago. Therefore if any two points A and M are given, the line, upon which
a body descends from A to M the most quickly, can be found, if a cycloid is described
having the same cusp at A and having the horizontal base passing through the point M ;
that is easily brought about from a single described cycloid, since all cycloids are similar
curves. Moreover the time, at which the body reaches M from A, is a minimum, equal to

375. From the solution of the given problems the solution of inverse problems follow, in
which the force acting is sought directed downwards, such that the given curve is a
brachistochrone. Moreover this curve must have the lowest point C as a horizontal
tangent and for some point A, where the motion starts, the tangent is vertical. As if this
equation dY = RdX is given for the motion, then
Hence it is found that

If therefore the radius of osculation at M is put as r, since r = − dXddY

P = 2rdS
Whereby the problem is solved by this single ratio: so that the radius of osculation of the
curve at M to a given line, is thus as the sine of the angle that the tangent to the curve
makes with the vertical, to the force acting, which is sought. Now the height
corresponding to the speed that the body has at M is given by :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

from which it follows that the speed of the body is proportional to the sine of that angle
that the tangent to the curve makes with the vertical. As if the curve CMA is a circle
described with radius c, then r = c and
from which the force becomes :
Therefore the force pulling the body down must be proportional to the abscissa AP, to
which also the speed is proportional.
Scholium 2.
376. The order requires that the brachistochrone line is found for the hypothesis of a force
acting pulling downwards, so that we can now determine the brachistochrone lines for the
hypothesis of centripetal forces. But the fundamental proposition (361) thus has been
prepared, so that elements of the curve Mm and mμ (Fig. 46) and the orthogonal
ordinates MP and mp are referred to the axis AP, which in the case of centripetal forces is
not easily squared. Indeed it is seen that the elements MG and mH can be considered as
converging to the centre of force; but this error arises from this, since the elements MG
and mH cannot be parallel, as required by the fundamental proposition, and which it is
wrong to disregard. It is evident that the situation might be restored by determining the
radius of curvature, which, if MG and mH are parallel to each other, is equal to
mG ; [recall in the inserted diagram above, that
MG : d . Mm
ds = 1 = ds . dθ , or r = 1 . dx = dx / d ( dy / ds ) , ignoring signs; ] which expression
dx sin θ dθ dx
sin θ dθ
cannot be put in place, if MG and mH converge to a centre of force. Whereby, before we
approach brachistochrones under the hypothesis of centripetal forces, [p. 185] we will
derive a property from the fundamental proposition to accommodate the hypothesis of
whatever the forces are acting. From which it is observed that the most celebrated
Hermann in Phorononia and others, who gave the brachistochrones for centripetal forces,
are in error, since they have used a principle not consistent with the truth, as will soon be
indicated.

Theorem.
377. Whatever the forces acting should be, that line is a brachistochrone, upon which the
moving body presses with a force that is twice as great, as either the centrifugal force
alone or the normal force alone.
Demonstration.
Whichever and however many the forces
acting should be, all these can be resolved
into pairs, of which one pulls along the line
MG (Fig. 46), and the other along MP. Let
that one pulling along MG be equal to P and
the one that pulls along MP be equal to Q ,
and calling AP = x, PM = y and AM = s and
likewise the height corresponding to the
speed at M is equal to v. From these two
forces the tangential force is equal to
Pdx −Qdy
and the normal force is equal to
ds
Pdy + Qdx
. On this account we have
ds
dv = Pdx − Qdy . When this expression is
compared with that produced above (364),
where we put dv = Pdx + Qdy + Rds ; [p.
186] Q is negative [as it acts in the opposite direction, i.e. inwards towards the axis AP;],
Pdy + Qdx
. But 2rv is the

Pdy + Qdx
centrifugal force, by which the curve at M is pressed, and
is the normal force.

and R = 0. Hence it follows from this to be the case that 2rv =
Whereby since the centrifugal force is equal to the normal force, the total compressing
force, which acts on the curve, is twice as great as either the centrifugal force alone, or
the normal force alone. Q.E.D. [See (369)]

378. In the following chapter we demonstrate that this same proposition is in place for a
medium with some resistance; which we could demonstrate here by the same labour; but
since resistance has been designated to the following chapter, it has been considered
rather to transfer this theorem there.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 1.
379. Therefore from this proposition it is easy to determine the brachistochrone for the
hypothesis of any forces acting. And now we can present this from the other part above,
where we determined the curves in which the total force given had the ratio to the
centrifugal force.
Corollary 2.

380. Since dv = Pdx − Qdy , then v = Pdx − Qdy with these integrals taken so that they
vanish on making x and y = 0, [p. 187] if indeed the motion should start from rest at A.
Corollary 3.

brachistochrone curve :

Corollary 4.
382. Since this equation is a differential of the second order and thus requires to be
integrated twice, whatever the constant that has to be added for the one integration, the
other must be effected, so that on making x = 0 also makes y = 0. Therefore an infinity of
brachistochrone curves are produced for the hypothesis of the forces acting. And with an
arbitrary constant it is able to be effected that the curve can pass through a give point.
Corollary 5.
383. The time, in which a body from A arrives at M , is equal to
[p. 188] which expression indeed before been found for the equation of the curve; now
this time must be the minimum amongst all the other times for all the curves connecting
the points A and M.
Scholium 2.
384. Again as in whatever hypothesis of the forces acting these curves are described
freely, in which the centrifugal force is equal and opposite to the normal force, thus these
curves are brachistochrones, in which the normal force is also equal to the centrifugal
force, but acting towards the same region. And as that property is common to all the
curves freely described in a resistive medium also, thus this property is extended too to
all the brachistochrone lines in a resistive medium.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

centre of forces C, [p. 189] likewise
MC is drawn with the perpendicular CT
to the tangent MT. Putting AC = a, CM

with this integral thus taken, so that it
vanishes on placing y = a. Moreover
Pp
the normal force is equal to y ; to this
the centrifugal force must be equal and
acting in the same direction ; for then
the brachistochrone curve comes about,
as we have shown in the preceding
proposition. Therefore the curve must
be convex towards the centre C and the
radius of osculation falls on the side
away from the centre C. Whereby,
ydy
since this expression dp shows the
radius of osculation, in as much as it falls towards the centre, now the expression for the

radius of osculation in our case is dp . Therefore the centrifugal force is equal to

Hence the equation becomes :
and with the value of p substituted from the above equation, there is obtained :

386. Since the height corresponding to the speed is given by : v = − Pdy = b , the speed
of the body at some place is as the perpendicular from C sent to the tangent, and in a
similar manner, where in free motion the speed is inversely proportional to this
perpendicular.
Corollary 2.
Pp
387. Let the radius of osculation at M = r; then 2rv = b from the condition of the

problem. Hence there is obtained r = Pp = bP . Moreover since at the start of the curve
at A, we set p = 0, or AC is the tangent to the curve, and the radius of osculation at A is
equal to zero also, except perhaps the centripetal force P likewise vanishes at A.
Corollary 3.
388. The body has the maximum speed at the place where dp = 0; moreover there from
the equation for the curve it makes dy = 0. Whereby the body moves the quickest in that
place where the straight line CM is normal to the curve. Therefore the curve beyond this
point recedes from the centre C.
Scholium 1.
389. Therefore the speed of the body at the individual points of the brachistochrone is not
proportional to the sine of the angle, which the tangent to the curve makes with the
p
direction of the centripetal force ; [p. 191] for the sine of this angle TMC is y , now the
speed has been found to be proportional to p . Indeed this property is in place if the
centre of forces is at an infinite distance and the directions of the forces acting are parallelEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Moreover the most celebrated Hermann in Comm. Acad. Petrop. A 1727 has attributed
this common property to all the brachistochrones in vacuo as in a resistive medium. And
on this account not only these lines, which he gave in a medium with resistance for
brachistochrones, are not such, but also those in vacuo found for centripetal forces.

[Recall that Johannes Bernoulli's solution had relied on Fermat's least time principle
from optics, whereby one can derive the law of refraction at a plane interface between
refracting media, and which can be applied for the uniform force case in mechanics, but
which it was unwise to extend to other cases.]
Example 1.
390. Let the centripetal force be in proportion to the distance of the body from the centre

of force ; the formula for the force becomes P = f . Whereby this gives
Which is the equation for the brachistochrone according to this hypothesis of the
centripetal force between p and y. Now the other equation between the arc described with
the radius, which is a measure of the angle ACM, and y is this :
The lowest point of this curve or nearest to the centre is obtained by putting either [p.
192] dy = 0 or p = y; moreover then it becomes :
therefore this is the minimum distance of the curve from the centre C. The radius of
osculation of this curve at any point is equal to :
Therefore at the point nearest the centre the radius of osculation is a maximum, clearly
equal to :

From which it is understood that the curves are algebraic, as long as b +b2 f is a square
number. Again, the length of the curve AM is generally equal to :

From which equation it follows that the brachistochrone curve AM is a hypocycloid,
which is generated by the rotation of a circle, the diameter of which is equal to :
described on the concave side of the periphery AE with centre C and with radius AC.
Therefore since b can be taken as you wish, it is apparent that all the hypocycloids arising
on the periphery AE are brachistochrones.

this cubic equation ay 3 + bf 2 y = abf 2 . Moreover this equation between s and y is

392. Therefore from these, which have been presented in this and in the preceding
proposition, it is understood, how under any hypothesis of the forces acting, that line can
be found upon which a body arrives at a given point in the shortest possible time from a
given point. Therefore it is now necessary to determine that line, upon which a body
arrives the quickest, not to a given point, but to a given line from a given point, which
curve reasonably is one from an infinite number of brachistochrones; but which we will
indicate in the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 44.
Theorem.
393. A body from a given point A (Fig. 49) arrives the quickest at some given line BM on
the brachistochrone AM, which crosses the given line BM at right angles, and this under
the hypothesis of some force acting. [p. 194]
Demonstration.
Let AM be that line on which the body from A arrives
the quickest at the line BM ; it is evident in the first place
that this line is a brachistochrone; for if the line is given,
upon which the body the body arrives more quickly at M
from A, by that the question is rather satisfied. Besides
this line AM crosses at the point M of the curve BM at
right angles; for unless it crosses at right angles, by
drawing a shorter normal mn, as mn < mM, the body can
arrive quicker at the curve BM along Amn rather than
along AmM. Whereby without exception it is necessary
that the place be found, so that the given curve AM stands
normally to the curve. Consequently, the body upon that
curve of an infinitude of brachistochrones drawn from A
to the curve BM arrives at the curve BM the quickest which crosses curve BM at right
angles. Q.E.D.
Corollary 1.
394. Therefore if an infinity of curves are sought, upon which arrives at BM from A in a
given time, then it is necessary that the given time is greater than the time for the
brachistochrone AM; for otherwise the problem becomes impossible.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 297
Corollary 2.
395. If it should happen that more brachistochrone curves are normal to the curve BM, [p.
195] the more maximum and minimum times are produces also. For this method indicates
minima as well as maxima times.
Corollary 3.
396. Since the time for a brachistochrone curve AM is a minimum, it is understood from
the method of maxima and minima, if two nearby brachistochrones are considered
standing normal to the curve BM, the times for these are equal to each other.
Corollary 4.
397. It is hence again evident, if the curve BM is of such a kind that all the
brachistochrones drawn from the point A cut at right angles, the times for all the
brachistochrones drawn as far as the curve BM must be equal to each other.
Corollary 5.
398. On account of which the curve, which for all the brachistochrone curves drawn from
the point A, which is the isochronous arc, or the curve that cuts the curves at the same
time of travel, that too cuts all the brachistochrones at right angles, or it is the orthogonal
trajectory of these curves.
Corollary 6.
399. And it is evident in turn too, if the curve [p. 196] which from the infinitude of curves
the isochronous arc cuts, is the orthogonal trajectory of this, then this infinitude of curves
are all brachistochrones.
Scholium.
400. It is easily understood that this proposition has a place too in a medium with
resistance ; for in a like manner it is apparent that the time to pass through the normal
element mn on the curve BM to be less that the time to pass through the element mM,
which is not perpendicular ; moreover in the whole of this demonstration the force has
been in place. Whereby if from the infinitude of curves drawn from the point A the law of
the forces acting and the resistance can be found, in which these curves are all
brachistochrones, likewise the orthogonal trajectory of these curves can also be shown by
seeking only the curve the isochronous arc cuts from these curves. And this method of
finding orthogonal trajectories now, the most celebrated Johan Bernoulli used in Act.

considered, the arc AM = s = ds and the time to pass

through AM, equal to
∫ dsgx , of which the one with respect to the other has to be a
minimum or a maximum. For the same is returned, either if between all the curves of
equal length, that curve is sought which has the shortest descent time, or if between all
the curves for which the descent is made in the same time that curve is sought which is
the shortest. Moreover, from my formulas,
∫ ds gives this quantity diff . ds , and
dy
∫ dsgx gives diff . ds gx , of which the one can be put equal to any multiple of the other.

From which the curve sought can be found. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
402. In the equation found there are two arbitrary quantities in there a and m, from which
it can be put into effect, that the curve passed through a given point C and that likewise it
is of the given length[p. 198]. But then this curve is completed the quickest among all the
other curves of the same length passing through A and C.
Corollary 2.
403. If a and m are put infinitely large, a cycloid is produced, which not only among all
the curves of the same length, but among all the curves entirely, is completed the
quickest.
Corollary 3.
404. If m is put equal to zero, then there is produced dy = 0 or a vertical straight line. But
if a becomes equal to zero, then there arises some straight line drawn through the point A.
For it is the straight line among all the lines which is completed in the same time, the
minimum or the shortest.
Corollary 4.
405. If m is put equal to 1, an algebraic curve is produced ; for the equation becomes :
the integral of which is :
This curve is indeed rectifiable; as it becomes :

straight line at that point of the curve is the diameter of the curve. Moreover at that place
4a and the length of the curve at that point is equal to 2a . And the time, in which

407. Now with these items concerned with the quickest speed of descent dispatched, we
progress to the these curves to be considered, upon which more descents have a given
relation between each other to be compared. Here it especially concerns the question of
tautochronous curves, upon which either all descents, or the whole oscillations, are made
in the same time to the lowest point. Then to this other difficult questions can be added
that illustrate the strength of the method that we are using.
PROPOSITION 46.
Problem.
408. To find the general law of tautochronous curves, upon which all descents to the
point A are completed in the same time, with the descent taken to start from any point on
the curve AM (Fig. 51). [p. 200]
Solution.
The right line AP is taken for the axis, calling
the part of the curve AM = s, and let the height
corresponding to the speed at A be equal to b, and
the height corresponding to the speed at M equal
to v ; the time in which the arc AM is completed is
equal to ds , which integral has thus been taken
∫ v
so that it vanishes on putting s = 0. Then, if v is
put equal to zero in that integral, the descent time
is had from that place in which the speed is zero,
as far as the point A or the whole descent time ;
that has to be expressed by the same amount, whatever the quantity b should be.
Therefore neither must this quantity b be present in the expression for the time nor in the
expression for the curve AM, since the same descent time must be produced by these
same curves, however b is changed.
Now let the quantity v be composed from the letter z, related to the curve and with the
curve AM only depending on the abscissa AP and the applied line PM , and not involvingEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 301
b, and from the letter h, which is composed from b and from constant quantities.
Moreover let v be such a function of of h and z, that it vanishes on putting z = h and so
that it becomes equal to b, if z = αh with α taken as some number. Again on putting
ds = pdz for the equation of the curve sought, p must be such a quantity, in which
neither b nor h is contained, since these lettes cannot arise in the equation of the curve.
Therefore we have for the expression of the time to complete AM,
∫ v with this
pdz
integral thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting v = b or z = αh . Hence this integral,
if z = h is put in that, [p. 201] gives the whole descent time, in which h cannot be present.
Now this comes about, if
∫ v is a function of h and z of zero dimensions, or if
pdz
pdz
is a
v
function of zero dimensions. Let v be a function of m dimensions of h and z; then it must
m−2
be that p = Cz 2 with C denoting a constant quantity not depending on b. Hence as often
as such a function can be ascertained for v, so this equation is obtained for the curve
sought:
if the constant is needed, so that s vanishes if either x or y vanishes at z. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
409. Therefore where this method can be used, it is required that v is an expression from
finite quantities and that this expression can be changed into a homogeneous function
from constant h and z.
Corollary 2.
410. On account of this it is necessary that v = b, if we put z = αh , where h is not found
in the constant quantity added. Therefore it is sufficient, if we had considered making v =
b by putting z = αh , nor is there a need [to add a constant], as the integration is
completed.
Corollary 3.
411. Also it is understood that the curve at A must have a tangent normal to the directing
of the force acting ; [p. 202] also unless this is the case, the time to descend an infinitely
small arc becomes small too.
Scholion.
412. This solution prevails not only if as the figure indicates, the curve is set out by
orthogonal coordinates; for nothing is different, for whatever quantities we wish to set out
for the nature of the curve, as long as b does not enter into z. Moreover z can contain lines
and any quantities depending on the curve. Therefore for this method in a vacuum, under
any hypothesis of the forces acting, tautochronous lines can always be found, since the
speed can always be expressed by finite quantities. But if, as in mediums with resistance
it is customary to happen, the speed cannot be shown by finite quantities, then this
method cannot be used, but another way is desired which is successful only if the speed
is given by a differential equation.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

413. If the body is acted on by some downwards force, to find the tautochrone line upon
which all the descents are made in the same time.
Solution. [p. 203]
On putting AP = x, PM = y and AM = s (Fig.
51) let the speed at A correspond to the height b
and at M it corresponds to the height v. Again let
the force acting at M = P; then it becomes
v = b − Pdx with the integral Pdx thus taken, in

order that it vanishes on making x = 0. Now if on
putting b = h and Pdx = z , v is a function of one
∫
dimension of h and z and vanishes on making z =
h and it becomes v = b by making z = 0. Therefore
m = 1 and thus this equation is found for the curve
sought (408) :

If the equation between x and y is desired, then on account of ds = aPdx ,

Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
414. Since the integral
∫ Pdx vanishes on putting x = 0, to tangent to the curve at A is
horizontal, unless P vanishes at A. And the curve has a vertical tangent somewhere on the
curve and there generally a cusp ; this comes about where the integral becomes
∫ Pdx = aP . For there dy = 0.

Corollary 2.
415. At the lowest point of this curve at A the radius of osculation is equal to the
ydy
, since at A, s and y become equal. Whereby at A the radius of
subnormal dx = sds
dx
osculation is equal to 2aP, where P denotes the force acting at the point A.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3. [p. 204]
416. From the radius of osculation at A and the force acting at A, the time for the ascent
or descent is found for the infinitely small arc equal to :
(172). And the time of each descent is equal to this time. Hence, under the hypothesis of
gravity equal to 1, a pendulum of length 2a completes an infinitely small descent in the
same time.
Example 1.
417. Let the force acting everywhere be constant, and certainly P = g; the integral
becomes
Pdx = gx and s = 2 gax
∫
likewise
thus it is understood that the curve is a cycloid convex downwards, clearly congruent
with the brachistochrone line under the same hypotenuse of the force. Moreover since all
the descents are made in the same time on the cycloid, that we have shown above. (187).
Example 2.
418. Let the force acting be as some power of x ; the force becomes
if indeed n + 1 is a positive number; but if indeed n + 1 is a negative number, then the
integral Pdx =∝ . Therefore we have
∫
From which equation it is understood that the curve is a straight line inclined at some
angle to the horizontal if n = 1. [p. 205] But if n > 1, the curve at the starting point A
becomes imaginary, clearly until f n begins to be less than ( n + 1 )ax n −1 .
Scholium 1.
419. From the general equation it is apparent that the line AP is the diameter of the curve.
Whereby when it is in a vacuum, the ascents are similar to the descents, all the semi
oscillations on the curve MA and on the other part as far as produced are also isochrones
and consequently also the whole oscillations. Then since on account of the arbitrary a,
there is an infinite number of tautochronous curves AM, and two which are joined at the
point A so that they have a common horizontal tangent there, so they produce semi-EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

oscillations as well as whole isochronal oscillations, as if a pendulum is permitted thus to
be accommodated, so that by oscillating it completes curves of this kind.
Scholium 2.
420. Also it is understood from the solution that these curves we have found are the
unique ones which satisfy the question. For in place of p another function of z cannot be
substituted, as in the integral, if v is put equal to 0, clearly from the formula b or h
emerge. That which by other methods, in which tautochrones are found, is not clear
enough.
Scholium 3.
∫
421. Since the arc is given by s = 2 a Pdx , then it arises that P = 2sds
. From which it
adx
is apparent, that the force acting must be of this kind, in order that the given curve is a
tautochrone [p. 206]. Clearly the force acting downwards must be proportional to sds
dx
from the given curve taken. Whereby, unless the curve is rectifiable, the value of the
force acting cannot be shown to be algebraic.

422. If the body is always drawn towards the centre of forces C (Fig. 52) by some force,
to find the tautochrone line BMA, upon which the body completes all the descend as far
as the point A in the same time.
Solution.
Call CA = c, CM = y and the centripetal
force acting at M is equal to P. Again let the
speed at A correspond to the height b and that at
M to the height v. The integral Pdy is taken
∫
thus, so that it vanishes on putting y = c, with
which done, the equation becomes
v = b − Pdy . Therefore by taking b for h

and Pdy for z , there is a function of h and z,
which is equal to v, of one dimension ; whereby
m is equal to 1. If now the arc AM is said to be

equal to s, it gives s = 2 az = 2 a Pdy and
hence ds =

, the
aP 2
equation for the curve sought. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1. [p. 207]
423. At the point A, where
∫ Pdy vanishes, there p = y, or the right line CA is normal to
the curve , and on that account the speed of the body is a maximum since A is the point of
the curve closest to the centre C.
Corollary 2.
424. If we put p = 0, the point of the curve B is obtained, at which the right line CB is a
tangent to the curve. And at that point, which is the maximum, the curve has a cusp. Now
∫
the point B is found from this equation : aP 2 = Pdy ; and y cannot be greater than the
value found from this equation.
Corollary 3.
∫
425. Also it is apparent from the equation found : s = 2 a Pdy , since an ambiguous
sign is involved with the square root, that the curve has two branches AB and AD similar
and equal to each other, and on this account the oscillations which occur on the curve
BAD are equal to each other.
Corollary 4.
426. The radius of osculation at the point A is equal to c2−acP
. And since AC = c, the
2 aP
time in which one infinitely small descent is completed on the portion of the curve AB, is
equal to π a (207); therefore all the times are equal to this time. [p. 208] On this
account, since the oscillations, which are made on the curve BAD, are isochronous with
the oscillations of a pendulum under the hypothesis of gravity equal to 1, of which the
length is equal to 2a.

2a
From which it follows, if 2a < f, that the curve has the convex side turned towards the
centre C, as the figure shows. But if 2a = f, the curve becomes a right line normal at A to
the line AC. Moreover the point B, where CB is a tangent to the curves, is found from this
equation ( f − 2a ) yy = ccf , from which it formed :
BC =
c f
( f − 2a )
. Therefore as often as it happens that f > 2a or the curve is convex
towards C, the curve has a cusp at B. And in these cases the curve is a hypocycloid,
which is generated by the rotation of a circle, the diameter of which is equal
to
c f −c ( f − 2a )

radius equal to
, upon the concave part of a circle with centre C described by the
c f
( f − 2a )
. Therefore in this case the tautochrone curves agree with the
brachistochrone curves found above (390).
But if 2a > f, in which case the curve is concave towards C, then BC becomes
imaginary and the curve AM no further is a hypocycloid. [p. 209] Moreover then we have
p2 =
( 2a − f ) yy + ccf
, hence p everywhere besides A is greater than AC. Let c = 0; then it
2a
becomes p = y
2a − f
, whereby in this case the tautochrone curves are logarithmic
2a
spirals described around the centre C. Clearly a body on logarithmic spirals always
arrives at the centre C in the same time, from wherever the descent started. Therefore the
tautochrones are under this hypothesis of the centripetal force : first all the hypocycloids,
then all the right lines drawn in some manner, thirdly all the logarithmic spirals and in the
fourth place all the infinitude of other curves contained in this equation :
p2 =
( 2a − f ) yy + ccf
, if indeed it should be that 2a > f and c is not equal to 0. Moreover
2a
under this hypothesis for tautochrones Newton in the Principia [Book I, Prop. LI,
theorem XVIII.] and Hermann in Phoronomia and in the Comment. Acad. Petrop. A
1727, [p. 139, see in particular p.150; P.St.] have given only hypocycloids, although here
our equally general equation can be had.
Example 2.
428. The centripetal force is put inversely proportional to the square of the distances from

the centre, so that P = yy ; the integral becomes:

hence the radius of osculation is found:
Therefore where p vanishes, there also the radius of osculation is equal to 0. Moreover
the value of BC is itself found from this equation : y 4 = cy3 + acff . [p. 210] Therefore if

quantity. Moreover it is apparent that this curve between A and B must have a turning
point, which arises if the curve at A is concave towards C, clearly if 2aff > c3.
Example 3.
429. Let the centripetal force be constant everywhere or P = 1; then we have
Pdy = y − c. Whereby if from the centre C with radius CM the arc MP is drawn, it
∫
becomes
∫ Pdy = AP and the arc AM = 2 a( y − c ) = 2 a AP . But again it becomes
•
hence BC = a + c is found and the curve AB = 2a = 2( BC − AC ) . Now the radius of
osculation at the point M is equal to
Therefore at the lowest point A the radius of osculating is equal to 22aac
. Therefore the
−c
curve at A is concave towards C, if 2a > c, but convex if c > 2a, and the radius of
osculation at A is infinitely large, if 2a = c. In the first case, in which at A the curve is
concave towards C, the curve has a turning point, where
If c = 0 thus so that the point A falls on the centre C, y becomes the chord of this curve

Sit AM ea linea super qua corpus ex A citissime ad

quantitas b neque in expressione temporis inesse debet neque in expressione pro curva

Sit iam v quantitas composita ex littera z, ad curvam pertinente et a curva AM cum

Ponatur porro ds = pdz pro aequatione curvae quaesitae; debebit p talis esse quantitas, in

vacuo ascensus sint similes descensibus, semioscillationes omnes super curva MA ad
alteram partem usque producta erunt quoque isochronae et consequenter etiam integrae
oscillationes. Deinde cum ob arbitrariam a infinitae sint curvae tautochronae AM, duae
quaequo in puncto A coniunctae, ut ibi habeant tangentem commumem horizontalem,
producent tam semioscillationes quam integras oscillationes isochronas, si scilicet
pendulum ita accomodetur, ut oscillando huiusmodi curvas absolvat.

420. Intelligitur etiam ex solutione eas curvas, quas invenimus, esse solas, quae quaesito
satisfaciunt. Nam loco p alia functio ipsius z substituti nequit, ut in integrali, si ponatur v
= 0, prorsus ex formual exeant b seu h. Id quod aliis methodis, quibus tautochronae sunt
inventae, non satis liquet.

Problema.
422. Si corpus perpetuo trahatur ad centrum virium C (Fig. 52) vi quacunque, invenire
lineam tautochronam BMA, super qua omnes corpus descensus ad punctum A usque
eodem tempore absolvat.
Solutio.
Dicatur CA = c, CM = y et vis centripeta in
M sollicitans = P. Sit porro celeritas in A debita
altitudini b et ea in M altitudini v. Sumatur
Pdy ita, ut evanescat posito y = c, quo facto
∫
∫
erit v = b − Pdy . Sumtis ergo b pro h et
∫ Pdy pro z erit functio ipsarum h et z, cui v
aequatur, unius dimensionis; quare erit m = 1.
Si nunc arcus AM dicatur = s, erit
∫
s = 2 az = 2 a Pdy atque hinc ds =

Si nunc in M ducatur tangens in eamque ex
centro C demittatur per pendiculum CT, quod
dicatur p, erit

423. In puncto A, ubi
∫ Pdy evanescit, erit p = y, seu recta CA erit normalis in curvam in
eoque propterea celeritas corporis erit maxima, quia A est punctum curvae centro C
proximum.
Corollarium 2.
424. Si ponatur p = 0, habebitur punctum curvae B, in quo recta CB curvam tangit. In
eoque puncto, quod erit supremum, curva cuspidem habebit. Invenitur vero punctum B ex

425. Apparet etiam ex aequatione inventa s = 2 a Pdy , quia signum radicale signum
ambiguum involvit, curvam duos habere ramos AB et AD inter se similes et aequales et
hanc ob rem oscillationes, quae super curva BAD fiunt, esse inter se aequales.

426. Radius osculi in puncto A est = c2−acP

descensus super curvae AB portione infinite parva absolvitur, = π a (207); huic igitur
tempori omnes descensus erunt aequales. [p. 208] Hanc ob rem oscillationes, quae fiunt
super curva BAD, isochronae erunt cum oscillationibus penduli in hypothesi gravitatis =
