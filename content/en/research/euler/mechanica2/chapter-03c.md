Problem.

565. If the resistance of the medium is partially constant and partially proportional to
the square of the velocity, to determine the motion of a body oscillating on the cycloid
MCB (Fig.66), even in the case in which the resistance is very small.

Solution.

As before let the diameter of the generating
circle be CD = 12 a , CP = x and the arc
CM = s. The speed at C is put to correspond to
the height b and the speed at M to the height
v. The force of the body always acts
downwards and is equal to g, the part of the
resistance which is constant is equal to h and
the part of the resistance proportional to the squares of the speeds is equal to kv as before;
k is an amount very small with respect to v and s, and both a and h are very small with
respect to g. Now let the descent be made on the arc MC; then
dv = − gdx + hds + vds
k
[In modern terms, we can view this as a work–potential energy transformation, in the
same element of time, by the various forces acting over their respective increments]

[It may be useful to write down the coordinates of the cycloid, which shares the same
coordinates as a point on the uniformly translated and rotated generating circle. We take
the origin at C, where the common point lies at the lowest point of the cycloid; the circle
with diameter 2a rolls along DA at a uniform speed v, and at M its coordinates are PM =
y, and CP = x. Now, the angle turned through by the radius a/4 is given by θ and henceEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

The ascent arc is found from the same formula
and since h is not found in these, the time of a semi–oscillation along MON is as above
equal to
Now the whole of the descent arc MC is equal to

F, then
In the following semi–oscillation the descent arc is F and the ascent arc is

Now the time, in which some semi–oscillation is completed along MCN , is equal to with this value put in place of c. Q.E.I.

Corollary 1.

566. If on placing c = 0, as the point produced at which the body is at rest, it is found that
MC = ha
;
g
hence the body can remain at rest not only at the point C, but beyond C also at a distance
ha on either side of C. Whereby in a medium of this kind it is understood that a
g
pendulum can be in a state of rest not exactly in a vertical line, but can disagree by an
angle of which the sine is gh .
Scholium 1. [p. 295]

567. Resistance of this kind is easily demonstrated from experiments having water in
place, obviously in the slowest motions a resistance proportional to the square of the
speeds is rarely observed; now in a fluid in addition to resistance proportional to the
square of the speeds it is not probable to give another, except a constant resistance. This
is confirmed from the experiments set up by La Hirio, in which he showed that it is
possible for a pendulum to remain in place in water beyond the vertical position. Which
could not occur if the resistance only depended on the speed. From Newton's
experiments, which he conducted regarding the retarded motion of pendulums in air, it
can be concluded that the constant resistance of a lead ball of diameter 2 inches to be

Hence here the globe suspended by a thread can depart from the vertical by an angle of
around 10''', which error moreover is beyond measurement. But this error can be greater
and sensitive to measurement, when a smaller and likewise lighter globe is used.
Corollary 2.
568. It can be deduced on making use of that equation (565) from above, in finding the
angle that
h = E − L − EL

which is equal to the sine of the angle that the pendulum is able to depart from the
vertical. But in place of E it is convenient to take a small arc in which the higher order
terms become negligible

Corollary 3. [p. 296]

569. From the equation
3 gk ( E − L )
n = 2 gEL + 6hak
it is apparent, when the arc described by the oscillation is greater, with that the term 6hak
becomes smaller with respect to 2gEL. And it is for this reason, that this resistance is
perceived only in the smallest oscillations.

Corollary 4.

570. Because h is a very small number according to the hypothesis in a fine medium, to
which this proposition has been applied, for the quantity ha almost vanished also before

Therefore the constant resistance does not change the times of the oscillations.

Scholium 2.

571. Therefore even if this constant resistance is considered to be joined with the
resistance proportional to the squares of the speeds, the calculation for that does not
become more extended or difficult. For from the maximum speed c , the whole arc
described for one semi–oscillation determined in the same way, if this constant resistance
is present or not ; and indeed in either case the same equation is plainly obtained. On this
account or from that to follow, it is seen that this law of resistance has a place, now that
other resistances besides this and that which is proportional to the squares of the speeds,
actually have not been found. [p. 297] Moreover fluids now for a long time have been
noted to exercise a twofold resistance, the one proportional to the square of the speeds
(Book I, (490)), which are observed in faster speeds only, and the other perceptible in the
slowest motions only. The former resistance arises from the force of inertia of the
particles of the fluid and through that the body loses its motion, when these particles
remove it; since the proportionality to the squares of the speeds cannot be doubted. Now
this resistance has arisen from the tenacity of the fluid, by which the particles of the fluid
cohere together and in turn and in turn can hardly be separated from one another.
Therefore while the body is moving through a given interval, a given number of particles
proportional to the interval must be separated from each other; whereby this resistance
agrees with the absolute force retarding the motion of the body, clearly which also in
equal intervals exercise an equal number of impulses on the body. Therefore this
resistance or force is always opposite to the motion of the body and it is a constant
retarding tangential force. But in this case the nature demands an exception from the
calculation, when the body is at rest. For since this force is constant, it must act equally
when the body is at rest and in motion ;
[What Euler has in mind may be the fluid equivalent of static friction as opposed to
kinetic friction; a body in static equilibrium can have frictional forces acting on it, though
these are not usually of the same size as the constant contact kinetic frictional force
acting on a moving body, and in the case of a body at rest on an inclined plane or on aEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

curve, that can adjust themselves up to a maximum value. At this time, the laws of
friction both of the fluid and the contact kind had not been formulated properly.]
moreover the resting body, since the particles of fluid are not being separated, this force
cannot be considered. To this it is agreed, since this force is opposite the direction of
motion of the body, and in the resting body, since it has no direction, it cannot have any
effect. But if the motion is investigated upon a curved line, the tangent to the curve
always has the direction of the motion, even if is actually at rest, [p. 298], and thus the
calculation shows the effect of this force even on the resting body ; hence in this case it is
necessary to make an exception to the calculation. Thus it can be said that a pendulum
body hence is able to remain at rest in some small interval around C , since the striving of
this body towards C is not sufficient to separate the particles of fluid from each other.
Whereby the body is able to remain at rest at some point of this interval, even if the
calculation also shows that the body cannot remain at rest at the point C.

572. From these, which we have treated generally in part, and in part brought to bear on
the cycloid, it is evident how in a medium with resistance in the square ratio of the
speeds, the motion of the body on any curve can be determined. Indeed we have
considered the medium resisting uniformly and an equal force also to be acting; but from
the equation to be resolved that also it can be integrated, as in whatever way the medium
is made non–uniform and a variable force acting as well; for always in the equation the
height v corresponding to the speed has only a single power. Therefore I proceed to other
hypotheses of resistances of the medium ; but since then the motion cannot be defined for
any curve, first curves are to be found, which allow the motion to be determined. [p. 299]
Here we assume these curves, according to our custom, which lead to homogeneous
equations, in which the indeterminates maintain a number of the same dimension. If the
resistance is proportional to the 2m exponent of the speed, this equation is obtained :
m
dv = ± gdx ± v mds ;
k
which since it is homogeneous between v and x, must be
ds = x − m dx, or s = a m x1− m ; or x = a m−1 s 1−m .
Or if x and s are increased or decreased by given amounts, on the curve of which this is
the equation :

the motion can also be determined. Hence in a medium with resistance in the simple

Solution.
Again as before let the diameter of the
generating circle be CD = 12 a , CP = x and the
arc CM = s. [p. 300] The speed at C is put to

to the height v. The force of the body always

Putting s = 0 and v = b; there becomes lC = l 2a 2b k ; hence,
Now in the other part of the curve CN for the ascent of the body, on putting CN = s this
equation is obtained :

(or by changing the meaning of C) , this is equal to :
This therefore becomes lC = l 4a kb ; hence there is obtained :
Hence it is apparent that in the descent the speed can never be equal to zero; for
4 kv has to be greater than s always. Therefore in this case, if the speed at the point C is
real, the start of the descent shall be imaginary. Whereby, wherever the body starts the
descent, the speed at the lowest point C is equal to 0. Therefore the motion has to be
investigated, if the descent is from some given point E and it is the case that
CE = f, then lC = l − af + 1 and thus
From which it is understood that it must always be the case that 4 kv < s , on account of
which at the point C, where s = 0, also it is the case that v = 0. The maximum speed,

with e denoting the number, of which the logarithm is equal to 1. Therefore in these
cases, in which the arc of the descent is real, the ascent arc is zero. But if the body
ascends through the arc CN with a speed at C corresponding to the initial height b, then
the motion is expressed by this equation : [p. 302]

If k < 8 g , which case we have treated now, the resistance thus is greater, on account of
which a much greater speed at C is zero, if indeed the descent if made from a given point,
and for the given speed at C, the descent is imaginary. On account of which the equation,
that we have deduced for the descent is imaginary, unless the constant is determined from
the start of the given descent. Therefore let the arc CE be equal to f; then we have
and on making s = 0, this becomes :
[the original expression and those that follow have been corrected in the O.O.]
if v is not equal to 0; for if v is equal to 0, then this equation is not valid. Moreover it is
apparent that this equation contains a contradiction, since 2av must be greater than gff

or 2v > a on putting s for f. But ss
= 2 x and thus should be that v > gx, which is

absurd; for in vacuo only is v = gx and in a medium with resistance thus it must be
smaller. But for the ascent the equation found is of use, and from that the whole arc of the
ascent CN is found by making v = 0, with which in place there is produced :
Therefore from these it is evident, if it should be that either k < 8ag or k = 8ag ,
oscillations cannot be performed, since no ascent is possible after the descent. [The cases
of over damped and critically damped systems]. Whereby the most important case
remains for us, in which k > 8ag , [p. 303] are to be examined ; since indeed in these the
resistance is smaller, and however small it is assumed to be, oscillations can always be
performed. Therefore with the above substitutions made we have :

proposition. Indeed from these arcs taken in order, all the arcs of the ascent are produced
successively as well as of the descent, while the body performs oscillations ; for since the
equation found is general, all these places can be shown in which the speed of the
oscillating body at some time is equal to zero. Whereby according to this hypothesis of
the resistance, this has the convenience that immediately for any oscillation, say the
hundredth, the arc of the descent as well as of the ascent can be defined. Let the arc [of

583. From the solution of this proposition, among others, it is to be understood that often
there is a need for much careful thought in drawing conclusions from the equations. For
in the case that k < 8ag the equations that we have found for the ascent and the descent,
having thus been compared, so that from these it is seen to follow that the ascending arc
is equal to the descending arc ; for on making v = 0 there is produced from either the
equation:
And thus they have also this [ratio] in common, unless the descent by necessity makes
b = 0. Moreover, on putting b = 0 no ascent is given, and the equation for the descent
evidently has to be changed. Whereby except for the case in which k = 8ag , we may turn
our attention to b being equal to 0, and it is with difficulty that the truth can be
understood from the equation. The same thing also happens, when according to the same
hypothesis k < 8ag with the descent made from some given point, and we inquire about
the speed at the point C; for on putting s = 0 the equation is reduced to the absurd. Thus
indeed the equation has been compared with that [ratio], as on making s = 0 it is not
shown that also v = 0, even if actually v is equal to 0; indeed only these terms are to be
neglected in which s is found, since the rest containing v by the same rule have to be
neglected. [p. 309]
Hence it is found that it is not possible for v = 0, if s = 0; but since absurdity follows from
the equation, unless is should be that v = 0, from this it must be concluded that v = 0, if sEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

falling into trouble.

Theorem.
573. In a uniform medium, that offers resistance in the simple ratio of the speeds, all the
descends on the cycloid AMC (Fig.66) are made in equal times and likewise also all the
ascents on the cycloid CNB are completed in equal times, if a certain force is acting and
it is uniform and directed downwards.
Demonstration.
For the descent, if the arc is taken CM = s and the height corresponding to the speed at
M = v, then this equation is obtained :
dv = − gsds + ds v

Put v = u ; then u is as the speed at M and on
this account, dv = 2udu and this equation is
obtained :

in which u and s everywhere are raised to the same power. Whereby if the initial descent
is put at E and the arc CE = f and the proposed equation is integrated, thus so that u = 0
on putting s = f , the equation of the integration is produced, in which u, f and s constitute
everywhere a number of the same dimension. [p. 310] Therefore from this u is equal to a

function of one dimension of f and s. Concerning which the element of the time ds

thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting s = 0, there is some function of zero dimensions
of f and s and it shows the time to traverse the arc CM. Therefore in this function, if on
putting s = f, f vanishes everywhere from this function, and the time of the whole descent
along EC is equal to a function composed only from the constant quantities g, a and k, in
which neither f nor any other quantity respecting the point E is introduced. On account of
which the time of the descent along EC is expressed by the same quantity, wherever the
point E is taken, and thus all the descents are completed in the equal times. If in the
formula for showing the descent time − k is put in place of k , the ascent time is
produced for the arc CNB, which therefore is also constant, however great the arc
traversed in ascending. Q.E.D.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 1.
585. Since u is equal to a function of one dimension of f and s, uf is equal to a function of
zero dimensions of f and s. Whereby if s = nf is put in place, then uf is equal to a constant
quantity, in which f is not present. Therefore in different descents the speeds at
homologous points of the whole arcs are proportional to the arcs f.
Corollary 2. [p. 311]
586. Since in the descent the maximum speed shall be where u =
gs k
, the point O is
a
found, or the arc CO from the equation, in which f and s everywhere constitute a number
of the same dimensions ; from which hence s or CO is proportional to f . Therefore in a
number of descents the maximum speeds are in proportion to the whole arcs CO of the
descents.
Corollary 3.
587. Since the time to pass along MC is equal to a function of zero dimensions of f and s,
the time also to traverse EM is equal to a function of zero dimensions of f and s or also of
f and the arc EM.
Corollary 4.
588. Hence consequently not only the times of the whole descents, but also the times of
the descents along similar parts of the whole arcs are equal to each other. And in a like
manner this is in place for the ascents.
Corollary 5.
589. Therefore since as all the descents are isochronous as are all the ascents, also all the
semi–oscillations are completed in equal times. And in the case k > 8ag , in which the
body continues oscillations perpetually, all are completed in equal times.
Corollary 6. [p. 312]
590. Therefore the cycloid, which is the tautochronous curve in vacuo, retains the same
property in a medium that resists in the simple proportion of the speeds. In addition the
cycloid is also a tautochrone in a medium in which the resistance is constant or in the
words of Newton, proportional to the moments of time (570).
Scholium 1.
591. This triple tautochronism of the cycloid Newton demonstrated too in Prin. Phil.
(Book. II, Prop. XXV & XXVI, 1687; 2nd ed.), and regarding the resistance in proportion
to the speeds, from this he formulated the demonstration, that in different descents, if the
parts of the arcs in proportion to the whole arcs are taken, in these places the speeds are
also in proportion to the whole arcs. For if the speeds should be proportional to the wholeEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

arcs, if the elements also are taken in proportion to the whole arcs, then the times for
these are equal to each other.
Scholium 2.
592. But although from these it is apparent that the times of the ascents as for the
descents are equal to each other, yet it is not possible to determine from these, how much
the time of either the ascents or the descents shall be, and neither also can the times of the
ascents or descents be compared between each other. [p. 313] For the equation defining
the relation between s and u is thus complicated, for that element of time ds
cannot be
u
expressed by one variable. Besides the infinitely small oscillations, which before the
calculation in determining the times returned most easily, under this hypothesis of the
resistance are of no help. For also if the whole arc described is made infinitely small, in
the equation
which arises from the above integration, indeed not a single term vanishes from those
remaining. Moreover the time of the ascent depends on the quantities a, k and g; but how
it is composed from these is not evident. Yet meanwhile this is certain, in which the
greater g shall be with the other parts, there the time is less, but with a increasing, the
time also increases, now with k increased to be diminished, since the resistance is made
smaller. Therefore in this hypothesis of the resistance, the resistance in the slowest
motion does not disappear, as in the resistances proportional to the square of the speeds.
From which it is seen to be a consequence, if the resistance increases in a ratio greater
than the square of the speeds, then in the slowest motions can be neglected, but if the
resistance is in a smaller ratio, in the slowest motions the resistance has to be considered.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

PROPOSITION 67. [p. 314]
Problem.
593. In a uniform medium, in which the resistance is in a ratio of the multiple of the
speeds of which the exponent is 2m, to determine the motion of the body on the curve
CMA (Fig.66) , in which any arc CM is proportional to a power of the abscissa CP, of
which the exponent is 1 – m.
Solution.
With the abscissa put as CP = x and with the arc
m
CM = s , then ds = a mdx . The speed at M
x
corresponds to the height v ; the resistance at M
m
is equal to v m and thus, if the body is placed to
k
descend on the curve CM, this equation is
obtained:
m m
dv = − gx + a mv mdx .
k x
Moreover for the ascent on the same curve, this equation is used :
m m
dv = − gx − a mv mdx
k x
Now each equation admits to being separated, if v = TX is put in place ; indeed for the
descent there is produced :
m m
xdt = −tdx − gx + a t m dx
k
or
− k m dt
= dx

k ( g + t )− a m t m
m
and for the ascent this equation :
− k m dt
= dx
.
x
k ( g + t )+ a m t m
m
[p. 315] In which equations the variables t and x are separated from each other in turn,
thus so that t can be determined in terms of x with the help of quadrature. The constant in
the integration to be added has to be defined either from the given speed at the point C or
from the location of the curve, at which the descent begins or the ascent ends. If the
abscissa of the whole arc of the descent or of the ascent corresponds to f, then v is equal
to a function of one dimension of f and x so in the descent as in the ascent on account of
the homogeneous differential equations. On this account, v is equal to a function of
half the dimensions of f and x. Therefore the time of the descent through MC, which is
equal to :
∫ dsv = a ∫ x ds v ,
m
m
1
is equal to a function of dimensions 2 − m of f and x. Moreover, since on putting x = f
1
2 −m
the time of the whole descent is produced as f
, also proportional to that is the time
of the whole ascent, if indeed f designates the abscissa of the whole ascent arc. If the
whole arc of the ascent or of the descent is put equal to A, since A is as f 1− m , then the
1− 2 m
time of either the whole ascent or descent becomes as A1 or as A 2−2 m . Therefore the
f2
1− 2 m
times of more of the ascents are in the 2−2 m th multiple ratio of the whole arcs described.
And in the same ratio also are the times of the ascents between themselves, but the times
of the ascents and of the descents cannot be compared with each other. Q.E.I.

Corollary 1. [p. 316]

594. Since the speed or v is equal to a function of half the dimensions of f and x, in
more descents the speeds acquired at the point C are in the square root ratio of the
heights, from which the body descended. And the heights, to which the ascending body
can reach, are in the square ratio of the initial speeds at C.

Corollary 2.

595. Since the times of the descents as well as of the ascents are as f 2 − m , then all the
1
descents are completed in equal times, if it should be that m = 12 or the resistance in
proportion to the speeds. And equally with this for the hypothesis, the times of the
ascents are equal to each other. Moreover the curve is a cycloid, as we have shown
before.

Corollary 3.
m
m 1− m
596. Since ds = a mdx , then the arc becomes s = a1−xm . From which it is evident, unless
x
m < 1, that the curve AMC becomes negative or imaginary, which is the same thing.
Indeed the curve must always be greater than the abscissa.

Corollary 4.

597. Besides always it must be the case that ds > dx ; whereby, when this happens, if
x = 0, m must be a positive number. Hence it is required in our proposition, that m is
contained between the limits 0 and 1.

Corollary 5. [p. 317]

598. In these cases the maximum values of x is a and there ds = dx or the vertical
tangent. And at this place the curve has a cusp ; indeed it cannot ascend higher, since if
x > a, it becomes ds < dx, which is not able to happen.


Corollary 6.

599. If m is contained between the limits 0 and 1, the curve has a horizontal tangent at C
2 m 1− 2 m
=a x
and the radius of osculation at C becomes equal to sds
dx
1− m
on putting x = 0.
Whereby the radius of osculation at C becomes infinitely small, if m < 12 , finite if
m = 12 , and infinitely great if m > 12 .

Corollary 7.

600. The times of the minimum descents and ascents are infinitely small, if m < 12 , but
finite if m = 12 . And finally they are infinitely great, if m > 12 . Therefore they hold the
ratio of the radii of osculation at the lowest point C.

Scholion.

601. Hence we have here examples of curves for resistance with a ratio held less than the
squares of the speeds, upon which the motion of bodies can be determined. [p. 318] But
if the medium resists in a ratio greater than the square, the curve never has a horizontal
tangent and thus descents and ascents are never able to be finished. Moreover since it
becomes apparent in an example, such is the kind of motion in a medium which resists in
a ratio greater than the square of the speeds; it may please to investigate the motion of a
body on a cycloid even in a medium, which resists as the fourth power of the speeds.

Now I select this hypothesis of resistance before others, since in this the speed can be
conveniently defined by a series.
