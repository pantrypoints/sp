PROPOSITION 73. Problem.

649. If the force is uniform and acting downwards and the medium resists according to
some power of the ratio of the speed, to determine the curve AM (Fig.73), upon which
the body by descending progresses along the horizontal AH at a steady rate.

Solution.

Let A be the highest point of the curve, through which the vertical axis AP is drawn, and the speed by which the body progresses horizontally corresponds to the height b. The abscissa AP = x is taken, the applied line PM = y and the arc AM = s and let the speed of the body at M correspond to the height v, with which speed of the body the element Mm = ds is traversed. Hence then as ds is to dy thus the speed of the body along Mm, which is v , os to the horizontal speed b , hence there arises :

v = bds2 .

Now let the force acting be equal to g, the exponent of the resistance equal to k and the

resistance itself is equal to v m . With these in place, there arises the equation :

Problem.

655. To find the curve AM (Fig.74), upon which the body is descending uniformly
downwards in a medium with some kind of resistance, with a uniform absolute force
directed downwards acting.
Solution.
With the abscissa AP = x and AM = s let the speed by
which the body descends regularly correspond to the height
b. Again the uniform force directed downwards is g and the
height corresponding to the speed at M is equal to v, and the
m
resistance is equal to v m ; hence the equation arises :

Corollary 1.

656. From these three equations, if the equation is desired consisting only of x, y and s,
that can be taken, from which the value of v can be most conveniently found, and with
this subsequently placed in either of the remaining equations.

Corollary 2.

657. Because the equation
has the indeterminates separated from each other in turn, the particular solution can be
obtained depending on the condition :
This is therefore :
and thus
Hence the equation is satisfied by the inclined straight line, if the body is moving upon
that with the given speed v .

Scholium 1.

658. Because in the preceding and in this problem too an inclined straight line presents a
particular solution, from that it can be understood that in a resisting medium an inclined
straight line may be found upon which the body moves uniformly, as we have shown
above (628). Moreover here each case of the problem is satisfied; if indeed the body
advances upon the straight line with a uniform motion, then it is moving horizontally as
well as vertically with a uniform motion ; then why not also be carried equally along any
direction.

Corollary 3.

659. For the vacuum let k =∝ . On account of which then we have x = gv or v = gx and
which equation integrated gives :

Scholium 2.
662. As we have determined the curves in these two problems, upon which the moving
body is carried uniformly either along the horizontal or down along the vertical, thus in a
like manner it is possible to solve the problem, [p. 356] if the body should be progressing
uniformly along any other direction; but that question, since nothing very pleasing is
deduced from the solution, this I have set aside, and for the same reason I do not touch on
isochronous problems about a centre for a resisting medium. Now I will apply myself to
these problems, in which a certain law of the speeds is proposed, a problem not a little
curious for resisting mediums, that has not been treated hitherto by anyone; which is not
indeed a problem for the vacuum. Clearly the curve is sought, upon which the body
reaches a given point with a maximum speed ; for in the vacuum the body moving on
some given curve always obtains the same speed at the same place. [An implicit
statement of the law of conservation of mechanical energy when there is no friction.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Problem.
663. Between all the curves that join the points A and C (Fig.75), to determine that
curve AMC, upon which the body descending from A to C acquires the maximum speed
with the resistance present as some power of the ratio of the speeds, and with the uniform
force acting downwards.
Solution.
In order that the body can arrive at the
point C with the maximum speed, each two
elements of the curve sought AMC
Mm ,mμ thus have to be put in place, so that
the body by running through these can take
the maximum increment of the speed [p.
357]. For if the body should acquire a
greater increase in the speed by passing
through the elements Mn ,nμ in other ways,
it will also have a greater speed at C.
Therefore by the method of the maxima the
position of the elements Mn ,nμ can be
found, if these elements Mn ,nμ are
compared with their neighbouring elements
and the increases of the speed, which is generated in each are put equal to each other.
The applied lines MP ,nmp and μπ are drawn in accordance to the vertical axis, and let the
elements Pp , and pπ be equal. Also the vertical lines MF and mG are drawn and on the
curves the normal elements mf and ng. Now let the force acting be equal to g, the
exponent of the resistance be equal to k, with the resistance in the ratio of the 2mth power
of the speeds, and the height corresponding to the speed at M be set equal to v. With these
in place, the increment of v along Mm is equal to
m
g .MF − v .Mm

k
and the increment of the height corresponding to the speed, while the body advances
along mμ , is equal to
(v + g .MF − v .Mm
) m mμ

m
Therefore while the body performs the elements Mm and mμ , the height v takes an
increase equal to :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 517
But the elements Mn and nμ on being traversed take an increment in v equal to :
From which equations put in place there is obtained : [p. 358]
Now we have Mn − Mm = nf and
and
Now on substituting these values, this equation arises :
But [since Mn = Mm + mg, and mμ = mg + gμ , ]
and on account of the similar triangles nfm, mFM and mgn, μGm
With these substituted and divided by mn there is produced :
The first two members of this equation are differential of the first order, now the third is
equivalent to a differential of the second order, that can be rejected, and hence the
equation becomes :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

From which equation the position of the elements Mm and mμ are determined. [p. 359]
Moreover in order that we may employ symbols, let AP = x, PM = y and AM = s; then

the construction of the curve. On placing dy = pds these two equations are obtained :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 1.
664. If the radius of osculation of the curve at M directed towards the axis is called r, then
[see diagram here : note that this diagram is slightly inaccurate, as the angle increment
should be negative, as the body moves down the slope and not up as assumed. Note also
that Euler's geometric derivatives are the geometrical ratios corresponding to the

Now 2rv is the centrifugal force of the body on the curve in this motion, the direction of

which is away from the axis, and ds is the normal force. Whereby in the curve sought
the centrifugal force is acting in the opposite direction to the normal force and is in the
ratio to the normal force as 2m to 1, that is as the exponent of the power of the speed to
which the resistance is proportional to unity.
Corollary 2. [p. 361]
665. Therefore all these curves with a concave part are directed downwards. For since the
direction of the normal force and of the radius of osculation are considered to be tending
towards the same place, the concavity of the curve must also be considered to be
downwards.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3.
666. In a medium with resistance in the simple ratio of the speeds we have 2m = 1.
Therefore in this case the centrifugal force is equal and opposite to the normal force. On
account of which the curve sought satisfying the trajectory is that described by the body
projected freely.
Corollary4.
667. Because in the equation
the indeterminates have been separated, three particular solutions can be obtained thus.
The first gives the equation αp + (1 − pp ) = 0 , in which case the speed becomes infinite
and the equation is satisfied by some line. In the second case p = 1, or dy = ds, which is
for a horizontal straight line, and in the third case p = 0, for a vertical straight line; which
has this property, that the body descending along it always accrues the maximum increase
in the speed.
Example 1. [p. 362]
668. The medium resists in the simple ratio of the speeds ; then it follows that m = 12 .
That is taken from the three equations found, which contains dy; it becomes
the integral of which is
But as
then the equation becomes :
or on neglecting the constant C, which does not change the curve, then we have :
Which equation divided by y and integrated anew gives :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 522
Which is the equation for that logarithmic curve itself, as we found the trajectory under
this hypothesis of the resistance in the first book (889).
Example 2.
668. Now let the resistance be in proportion to the square of the speeds; then it is the case
that m = 1. This equation is taken :
Moreover, the integral of this is
Hence it becomes :
Which is the equation for the curve sought, which has this property, that the centrifugal
force of the body is twice as great as the normal force. Therefore the curve is constantly
pressed upwards by a force equal either to the normal force, or to half the centrifugal
force.
[There is the continual problem with Euler's mechanics that he does not restrict himself to
the forces acting on the body alone, but also includes these reaction forces acting on the
curve. Thus, what Euler calls the centrifugal force exerted on the curve is the reaction of
the centripetal force, which in turn is the contact force due to the curve acting on the
body; again, the normal force is the reaction force of the curve corresponding to the
normal component of the weight.]
Now the body thus moves on this curve so that the height corresponding to the speed at
M is equal to :
Scholium 1. [p. 363]
670. Although according to any hypothesis of the resistance, there is a place for the
particular ratio between the centrifugal force and the normal force, the vacuum moreover
should be considered as well as the case for each resistance, and it follows in vacuo that
any curve is satisfactory [i.e. as conservative forces only apply.] Also all the curves in
vacuo have this property, that upon these curves from the equality of the heights equal
speeds are generated, and thus nothing extra can be defined that provide satisfaction to
the question rather than the rest of the equations.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.
Chapter 3e.

page 523
Scholium 2.
671. It is worth noting in all these curves found that the speed of the body is nowhere
equal to zero. And therefore the problem cannot be resolved by this method, that among
all the descents made from A to C from rest, this curve in which the body reaches the
maximum speed can be determined ; to which question only the vertical straight line
passing through C and joined to the horizontal drawn through A joined together is
satisfactory. Moreover our solution has been prepared, so that the positions of any two
neighbouring elements can thus be defined, which produce either the maximum or
minimum increase in the speed. On account of which by this method that curve is found,
upon which the motion of the body acquires either a greater or smaller increase in the
speed than upon another curve connecting A and C, [p. 364] if the body begins the
descent from A with the same speed. Moreover, by this reason it is possible to pick out
from the curves found that curve produced, upon which the smallest increase in the
speed is generated, or upon which the body is carried with the maximum uniform speed.
And in this sense it is easily observed that the motion cannot begin from rest. Though it is
certainly the case that if the points A and C have been placed on a vertical straight line,
then upon this line from the vertical motion made from rest at A, the maximum speed is
produced at C; yet the calculation does not give this solution, even if the vertical line is
present, if the initial speed at A is made to correspond to the height k m g , which speed is
of such a size, that no further increase can be taken. Therefore with this speed the body
descends uniformly from A to C; and for this reason zero is the minimum increase taken
in the speed. Therefore the problem, in order that it has an agreeable solution, must be
proposed thus : among all the lines joining the points A and C to determine that line,
upon which the motion of the body takes the smallest increase in the speed, and likewise
to define a fitting initial speed of the body at A.
[It is evident that Euler finds that the method fails under certain boundary conditions.
Thus, if the initial speed is zero, that value cannot be treated as a variable; again, if the
body has reached its terminal velocity at A, then the method fails, as no further increase
in speed is possible.]
Scholium 3.
672. Now problems of this kind ought to follow in a prescribed order, in which suitable
curves are to be investigated by a certain given relation of the times ; but since many
relations of the times can be reduced to relations of the speeds, I do not bring forwards
questions of this kind [p. 365]. However, in this work I will examine the question of the
brachistochrone curve, since that, even if the condition of the time has to be prescribed,
cannot be reduced to ratios of the speeds, and to which we will now attend. Whereby I
will use the same premises as in the above treatment of the brachistochrone in vacuo (361
– 366).

PROPOSITION 76. Theorem.

673. In a medium with any kind of resistance and under the hypothesis of absolute forces
of any kind, that curve AMC is a brachistochrone or that produces the shortest time of
descent between A and C; in which the centrifugal force is equal to the normal force,
and directed in the same plane.
Demonstration.

Whatever the absolute forces should be acting on the
body at M , these can be resolved into two forces
normal to each other, of which the one is ML = P,
and the other is MN = Q. With the element of the
curve taken Mm = ds and with the perpendiculars
ml and mn drawn, let Ml = mn = dx and ml = Mn =
dy. The height corresponding to the speed at M is
equal to v, the resistive force is equal to R, and the
radius of osculation at M = r, which I put directed
upwards, thus in order that on putting dx constant,

ds . With these in place, [the governing
then r = dxddy
equation becomes :]
since
dv = Pdx + Qdy − Rds ,
Pdx + Qdy
is the tangential force arising from the forces P and Q. But always from
ds
the nature of brachistochronism, if [p. 366]
dv = Pdx + Qdy + Rds ,
we find the equation to be
2v = Pdy −Qdx
r
ds
(364), which formulas differ only in the sign of the letter R from that of ours, and thus
does not come into the computation. Moreover 2rv denotes the centrifugal force acting
along the normal MO and
Pdy −Qdx
is the normal force acting along MO and arises from
ds
each force P and Q. Whereby if the centrifugal force is equal to the normal force and
along the same direction in the same plane, then the curve is a brachistochrone. Q.E.D.

Corollary 1.

674. If the normal force, which arises from the resolution of the absolute forces acting on
the body, is called N and the tangential force arising from the same resolution is put as T,
then [the basic equations become] :
which two equations joined together must give the brachistochrone curve.
Corollary 2.
675. Therefore, whatever the resistance should be, always it is the case that v = Nr
,
2
hence the speed of the body on the brachistochrone is easily found. For the ratio : force
of gravity 1 is to the normal force N thus as half the radius of osculation is to the height
corresponding to the speed at M.
Scholium. [p. 367]
675. The same proportion is also in place in the free motion of a projected body ; indeed
it is also the case for free motion that the centrifugal force is equal to the normal force.
But there is a distinction : in free motion the centrifugal and normal forces are opposite to
each other in direction, but for brachistochrones they act together; or in free motion the
directions of the radius of osculation r and the normal force N coincide, while in
brachistochrones they are in contrary directions to each other. On this account here we

Corollary 3.

677. Since v = Nr
is produced naturally from the formula of the brachistochrone, if this
2
value is substituted in place of v everywhere in the other equation dv = (T-R)ds , then
equation showing the nature of the brachistochrone curve is obtained.

Corollary 4.

678. Therefore in whatever the resisting medium and for whatever the forces acting on
the body, these curves are all brachistochrones, in which the total force sustained by the
curve exerts a force which is twice as great as either the centrifugal force alone or the
forces acting alone that arise from the resolution of the normal force.


PROPOSITION 77. Problem.

679. In a uniform medium, which resists in some ratio of the powers of the speeds, and
with the absolute force present uniform and directed downwards, to determine the
brachistochrone AM (Fig.74) upon which the descending body arrives at A from M in the
shortest possible time.
Solution.
With the abscissa AP = x put in place on the vertical axis
and with the corresponding applied line to that PM = y and
with the arc of the curve sought AM = s let g be the force

the speed at M corresponds to the height v. With these in

page 527
and this equation sets out the nature of the curve sought. In order that this equation can be
reduced, and then prepared for the construction of the curve, I put ds = pdx, so that
dy = dx ( p 2 − 1) ,
and
dds = dpdx and [ddds =] d 3s = dxddp.
With these substituted we have this equation :
Now again, let dx = qdp, then
ddx = 0 = dqdp + qddp or ddp =

This equation is multiplied by mp −3 m−1 so that it becomes integrable, and there is obtained:

There is now put in place :
P is a certain function of p and hence is given, even with quadrature permitted.
Therefore with these in place, we have
p3q = P and q = P3 .

Now since dx = qdp, then we have : [p. 370]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 528
Hence the construction of the brachistochrone curve follows. Q.E.I.

Corollary 1.

680. Let the point A, at which the motion begins and the speed is zero; then there we have
v = 0 or
gdsdy 2
= 0,
2 dxdds
hence dy = 0, since it is not possible for ds to vanish. The curve therefore has a vertical
tangent at the point A.

Corollary 2.

681. Because in the initial motion, the motion in a resisting medium does not disagree
with the motion in a vacuum, then the start A of the curve AM does not disagree with the
cusp of the cycloid, which is the brachistochrone in vacuo. And thus at A not only is the
tangent vertical, but also the radius of osculation at that location is infinitely small.

Corollary 3.

682. Because dy = 0 at A and also dy = dx ( p 2 − 1) , then at the point A, p = 1. Therefore
from the given construction of the curve the point A is obtained on making p = 1.
Therefore that integral must be taken, so that x, s and y vanish on putting p = 1.
Corollary 4.
683. Since we have :
gdsdy 2
v = 2dxdds ,
this becomes, as ds = pdx and dds = dpdx
v=
gpdx ( p 2 −1)
2dp
and since dx = qdp then [p. 371]
v=
gpq ( pp −1) gP ( pp −1)
.
=
2
2 p2
Thus it is apparent that v vanishes if we put p = 1.

Corollary 5.

684. The radius of osculation at some point M is equal to
2
ds 3 = ds dy .
dxddy dxdds
Whereby on account of ds = pdx the radius of osculation becomes :
Therefore at the point A, where p = 1, the radius of osculation r = 0.


Corollary 6.

685. Let B be the point of the brachistochrone, at which the tangent is horizontal; then
there dy =∝ and thus p =∝ . Therefore the point B is found on putting p =∝ . Hence at
gP
this point v = 2 and the radius of osculation r = P.

Example 1.

686. We can put the resistance to be vanishing, thus so that the motion becomes that in a
vacuum; then k =∝ and thus the equation is obtained :
dsds3 − 3dds 2 = 0 .
Which equation divided by dsdds and integrated gives :
ldds − 3lds = lC
or
dds = 1 = dx .
adx adx 2
ds 3
This equation integrated again gives :
− 1 2 = x 2 +C .
2ds
adx
Or with the constants changed, and with ds = pdx put in place, then − a = ppx + Cpp;
since on putting p = 1 x must vanish, and the equation becomes
x=
a ( pp −1)
or p =
pp
a
(a − x)
and thus ds = dx a ,
(a − x)
which is the equation for the cycloid as agreed.

Now the curve BNC also has a vertical tangent at C, since the point is found on putting
dz = dt. Now in this position this equation becomes :
and
while for the other branch, it becomes
From which it is apparent that the point A is to be placed higher than the point C and the
curve has cusps at A and C or the points of return, thus so that both AD and CE are
diameters of the curve; that which is understood from this, is that
where
( p 2 − 1) takes positive values as well as negative ones.

688. Below it is observed that this brachistochrone curve is congruent with the
tautochrone curve for the same hypothesis of the resistance. Now there is a difference
between tautochronous and brachistochronous motions, as according to tautochronous
motion being obtained, the body must descend on the branch CNB and ascend on the
other; while the opposite is true for the brachistochrone motion, as it must descend along
AMB. Yet meanwhile each of these curves certainly is worthy of attention, and since in
vacuo the same agreement is observed. 

Example 3.

689. The medium resists in the ratio of the square of the speeds, thus so that m = 2. This
equation is obtained for the curve sought :
now in constructing the curve :
thus P becomes :
and
and
Therefore the general construction of the curve is obtained. But since n can denote any
number, let n = 12 ;then
as thus we add a constant so that y = 0 on putting p = 1.
[On putting n = 12 then
which formula, since 2 p 4 − 3 p3 + p does not contain the factor pp – 1, does not admit to
the reduction made by Euler. Thus also neither can the following formulas be put in
place. Note by P. St. in the Opera Omnia]
Now p =∝ gives the applied line
Moreover,
and

From which it follows
which is the equation between the coordinates x and y for the curve sought.

690. In a medium, which resists in the simple ratio of the speeds, it is not possible to
determine the simpler brachistochrone, as follows at once from the general construction.
On account of which we do not describe this case in detail by an example. Moreover that
may be checked concerning the remaining propositions here, in which the curve is
sought, upon which the body descends the quickest to arrive at a given line, which is
either straight or a curve, and that can be solved in a similar way for a resisting medium
as for the vacuum. While clearly from the same point A, innumerable brachistochrone
curves can be sent off, from these one has to be selected, which for the given line – either
straight or curved, it meets at right angles; indeed upon this line, as shown in the
previous chapter, the body arrives at that line in the shortest possible time. By similar
reasoning the curve, which all the brachistochrones cross at right angles, cuts from all
these curves the isochronous arcs or [the corresponding] arcs which the descending body
completes in equal intervals of time. And all these are obtained in the same way,
whatever should be the resistance and whatever the absolute forces. But now we will set
out most generally an understanding of the brachistochrone problem.
