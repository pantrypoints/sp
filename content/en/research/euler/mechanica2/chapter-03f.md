Problem.

691. In a medium with some kind of resistance and with some kind of forces acting to
find the brachistochrone AM (Fig.78), upon which a descending body arrives the
fastest from A to M.
Solution.


Let A be the starting point of the motion,
through which some straight line AP is drawn
being taken for the axis, on which the abscissa
AP = x it taken; to which there corresponds the
applied line PM = y and the arc AM = s. Again
let the speed of the body at M correspond to the
height v and the resistance depending somehow
on the speed equal to R. Now the body is acted
on by some absolute forces act on the body, in
place of these two forces can be substituted in
the given directions ML and MN, of which the
former is parallel to the axis AP, and indeed the
latter normal to that axis. Moreover the force
acting on the body following ML is equal to P
and the force along MN = Q. From these
forces, there arises the equation :
dv = Pdx + Qdy − Rds.
And the nature of the brachistochrone curve gives :

with the differential of this substituted in place of dv and in place of v itself in the
resistance R, the equation is given for the curve sought. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1. [p. 377]
692. The equation for the curve, if v is eliminated in the stated manner, becomes a
differential of the third order. Whereby if the threefold integration is to be obtained,
then also three constants can be added, in which to be effective, so that on x
vanishing, likewise both y and s or v vanish and in addition the curve passes through
the given point M .
Corollary 2.
693. Therefore since the brachistochrone curve can always be shown, which has the
starting point A and passes through a given point, an infinite number of
brachistochrone curves can be drawn from the point A.
Corollary 3.
694. With the equation for the brachistochrone curve AM known, likewise the speed
of the descent on that curve can be found at individual points; and as much as
v=
Pdyds 2 −Qdxds 2
.

Corollary 4.
695. With the speed given, from that the time can be determined in which the body
completes the arc AM ; clearly the time to pass along the arc AM is equal to :
and that can now be found on account of the equation between x and y, even if it has to
be shown by quadrature.

Corollary 5. [p. 378]

696. Therefore if the curve is to be found, which all the brachistochrones drawn from
A must cross at right angles, then the construction of this line is obtained, if an amount
of the same magnitude
is cut off from all the brachistochrones. According to this, the arc of the isochrone is
cut off from this infinitude of curves which, since all the curves are brachistochrones,
terminate at right–angles to the trajectory. [Thus, the beginnings of sets of orthogonal
curves is set out.]
Example.
697. Let the resistance be proportional to the square of the resistance and let the
exponent of the resistance be some variable q; then R = qv . Hence since
dv = Pdx + Qdy − vds
,
q
on integration it becomes :
But since
v=

,
2dxddy
then the above equation becomes :
in which equation v is no longer present. Yet meanwhile this equation becomes an
equation of the third order, if the integration signs are removed by differentiation;
besides the indeterminate values of P, Q, and q are reasons by which the equation is
less able to be prepared for construction.
Scholium.
698. Here it is clearly evident, concerning the brachistochrone curves that have been
deduced from the two forces P and Q, since however many forces are acting on the
body, all of these can be resolved in this manner into two, but only if the directions of
all the forces lie in the same plane. [p. 379] On this account also in this proposition,
the brachistochrones are held for any hypothesis of the centripetal forces acting, which
moreover, since neither well–ordered nor constructible equations are forthcoming, we
shall not pursued further. Therefore with these disposed of, in which the speed is
prescribed by a certain rule, we progress to the following questions, in which curves
are required, which sustain a given force on these from the body in motion.

699. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity and a uniform medium, which
resists according to some ratio of the speeds, to determine the curve of constant
pressure AM (Fig.79), which sustains the same pressing force everywhere by a body
descending on it.
Solution.
On putting AP = x, PM = y, AM = s and for the
speed at M to correspond to a height equal to v, let
the force of the body pulling downwards following
ML be equal to g, and the force of the resistance at M
m
= v m . Therefore, while the body progresses through
k
the element Mm,
m
dv = gdx − v mds .
k
[p. 380] We put the curve to be convex downwards,
thus so that MR is the direction of the radius of
curvature and the radius of osculation itself is MR =
ds 3 ,with dx put constant. Hence the centrifugal
dxddy
force is in the direction of the normal MN and the
size of this is equal to
2vdxddy
. Now following the
ds 3
same direction, the curve is pressed by a normal force
gdy
arising from the resolution of the force ML = g , which is equal to ds . Therefore the
gdy
2vdxddy
total force, by which the curve is pressed along MN , is equal to ds +
ds 3
since it has to be constant, that is put equal to αg and there is obtained :
αgds 2 = gdyds 2 + 2vdxddy
and hence
v=

Let ds = pdx and dy = dx ( p 2 − 1) ; then we have :

Corollary 1. [p. 382]
700. The curve found hence has this property, that at any point M it is pressed towards
MN by a constant force, which is in the same ratio to the force of gravity ML = g, as
α is to 1.
Corollary 2.
701. If a negative number is taken for α , the curve is equally pressed everywhere
along MR, in the opposite direction. Therefore in this case the curve must be concave
downwards, since the centrifugal force is in the opposite direction and is greater than
the normal force, and the direction of this force has always been placed along MN.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3.
702. If α = 0 , then the curve is produces that sustains no pressing force from the
body. Hence this is the curve that the motion of the body projected freely describes.
Corollary 4.
703. If α = 1 or the total pressing force is equal to g, then the curve is convex
downwards everywhere. For since the normal force alone is everywhere less than g
except in the case that ds = dy, the centrifugal force acts together with that, and thus
the radius of osculation falls on the opposite side of MN .

704. If we put

Hence a special solution is obtained, since in this equation the indeterminates can be
separated from each other, on putting P = 0. Moreover this becomes ;

Thus there is produced :

706. The integration of a similar formula to which u is equal, also follows if α = −1 ,
in which case there is produced a curve concave downwards, in which the centrifugal
force is in the opposite direction and is greater than the normal force ; obviously the
excess is equal to g. Now the same equation is produced, as for the case α = 1 , except
that the sign of ( p 2 − 1) has to be changed.
As pertains to the remaining questions touched on so far, in which other laws of
the pressing force are proposed, these either can be deduced from exceedingly long
calculations, or now have been handled. Indeed we have seen that the curves in which
the total pressing force is twice as great as either the centrifugal force alone, or the
normal force alone, are the brachistochrones, and curves in which another ratio acts,
we have now handled these too, while we should investigate curves on which the
motion is accelerated the least. [p. 385] Hence it follows that we proceed to finding
curves, upon which many diverse descents and ascents are governed among
themselves by given laws, which questions are the most difficult. For it is necessary in
solving problems of this kind, that the speed of the body at individual points can be
expressed by quantities from which the nature of the curve can be determined.
Moreover, since they cannot be completed according to any hypothesis of the
resistance, as we have noted above, such questions can only be proposed for special
hypothesis of the resistance. Therefore this treatment is especially adapted to
resistance in proportion to the squares of the speeds, since in that case the canonical
equation, by which the speed is determined, leads to separation of the variables, and
thus the speed can be determined. Then also to be considered is the resistance which is
proportional to the biquadratic of the speeds, since for that hypothesis the speed can
become known in a certain way. And finally for whatever law of the resistance, but
only if the resistance becomes very small, questions of this kind emerge with a
solution more easily. Now in these problems either the ratio of the speeds which have
been acquired in different descents on the same curve is investigated, or the ratio of
the times in which different descents or ascents have been completed. And in each
kind, either from the ratio of the given times or speeds acquired from different
descents, the curves are to be found.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

707. In a uniform medium, which resists in the ratio of the squares of the speeds, and
with an absolute force acting downwards, to compare the speeds between themselves
at the point A (Fig.80), which are acquired in different descents of the body on the
curve MA.
Solution.
Let the speed at A, acquired in one descent, correspond to the height b, and the
speed at M correspond to the height v. Put AP = x, AM = s, the force acting at M,
which is variable in some way, is equal to P and the exponent of the resistance is equal
to k. With these in position, we have :
dv = − Pdx + vds
,

which equation integrated gives :

with the integral e k Pdx thus taken, so that it
vanishes on putting x = 0. Now let M be the starting
point of the descent, where v = 0; this point is found
from the equation
∫
−s
b = e k Pdx .
Now another descent is put in place to come from a
neighbouring point m and the speed acquired at A corresponds to the height b + db.
Hence we have

equal to the sum of all the terms e Pdx from A as far as m; now in the first equation,

db = e k Pdx.

708. Hence from the given arc of the descent AM = s, the height corresponding to the
speed acquired by the speed at A is given by :

Or if the point M and the speed at A are considered as the only variable quantities, then
there is this equation between them :

descent and the speeds acquired at the point A, the equation is found for the curve AM
satisfying the proposed conditions.

this arising set equal to q, in place of the equation found there is produced this

e k is less than unity and on this account db < Pdx. In vacuo now it is the case that

the arc AM = s to a corresponding height b. Then indeed it becomes :

or in a non-uniform medium :
db = e ∫ q Pdx .
Which formulas from the descents are found to be made serviceable on putting – s in
place of + s ; with which put in place the descent is always changed into the ascent.
Hence it is apparent, as for the descent always it is the case that db < Pdx, thus for the

ascents it is always the case that db > Pdx, since e k or e ∫ q is greater than one.

account the equation

thus must be integrated, so that b vanishes on putting x = 0. Moreover if b is given
thus, so that db is expressed in terms of dx , the equation can be divided by dx. On
which account it may not be possible to apply this condition to that equation, unless
perhaps the equation freely has this pleasing property. But if such a value of b is
given, in order that db = Rds or b = Rds with b vanishing on making s = 0, then the

from which it is understood that the curve is tractrix for a thread of length k on a
horizontal base at a distance down from the point
A by the interval αgk . Hence the curve can be
constructed in this manner : upon the horizontal
base CE (Fig. 81) and with the string BC = k the
tractrix BA is described; then the horizontal line
DA is drawn at a distance DC = αgk from CE ;
with which done the part of the curve BA sought
is satisfied. Moreover we can place the vertical
line BC and B the highest point of the tractrix; from which it is understood that by
necessity α must be less than g. If indeed it should be greater, then it follows that CD
> CB and thus the point A becomes imaginary. But if it is the case that α = g , then
the point A falls on B and thus is the only satisfactory point. If it is the case that α = 0 ,
then the point A is at an infinite distance and the descending body loses all its speed.
Therefore since it must be the case that α < g , then b < gs.
Example 2.
717. As according to the above hypothesis of resistance and force acting, the curve
AMF (Fig. 82) is sought, upon which all the
ascents made from the point A thus have in
common, that the whole arcs for each of the
individual complete ascents are proportional to the
squares of the speeds of the motion starting from
A. [p. 391] Hence as before we have b = αs and

drawn to the horizontal then A is the point, in which all the ascents must begin. HenceEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

therefore it is also understood that α cannot be greater than g, as previously the point
A becomes imaginary. But if α = g or b = gs, then A falls on B and the arc traversed
for any ascent is equal to bg .

718. Many examples of this kind I omit here, since they can be resolved so easily from
the general formula ; nor do I report also on questions of this kind for other hypothesis
of the resistance, for which the solution of these are able to be found, since such
questions are now neither subject to discussion nor are considered curious enough
that the solutions of these are required. Therefore we proceed to more worthy
problems, in which the curves sought are tautochrones, upon which either all the
ascents or descents are completed in equal times.

719. According to the hypothesis of a uniform force acting in the downwards
direction and with a uniform medium, which resists in the ratio of the square of the
speeds, to find the tautochrone curve AM (Fig.80), upon which all the descents as far
as the point A are completed in equal times.
Solution.
Some descent is considered, in which the speed that the body has acquired at the
lowest point A corresponds to the height b. Putting AP = x, AM = s, the height
corresponding to the speed at M is equal to v and the force acting is equal to g and the
exponent of the medium is equal to k, thus so that the resistance at M is to the force of
gravity as kv to 1. With these in place, we have :
dv = − gdx + vds

thus with the integral e k gdx taken thus, so that it
vanishes on putting x or s = 0. Hence from this
equation the start of the descent is found by putting

in order that the time of the whole descent thus becomes equal to

t = b after the integration. Now since this expression always gives the same value, it is
du is a function of zero dimensions of b and t, so that on putting t
necessary that
∫ (b-t )
= b, b vanishes from the formula. On this account du must be a function of dimensions
one half only of t, since u cannot depend on b. Therefore it is necessary that du = αdt
t
with the quantity α arising not containing b. With this in place the time of one descent
is equal to α

, putting t = b after the integration. Or with the ratio of the

diameter to the periphery put as 1 : π , then the time of one descent is equal to απ ;
which value always remains, in whatever manner b or the start of the descent is
changed. Hence the tautochrone curve sought is determined from this equation

here it is 2a, and there it was a, and the exponent of the resistance of the

expressed through the series; for it becomes 2ax = 1s.2 or 4ax = s 2 , the equation for the
2
cycloid.
Corollary 9.
729. Hence the curve BMANC exactly as the cycloid has vertical cusps at B and C, and
so that these can be found, put dx = ds, and hence for the arc BMA
and the height of this BD becomes equal to

Or through series we have :

Corollary 10.
730. From these it is evident that the cusp C of the ascending arc is higher than the
cusp A of the descending arc. And the arc ANC of the cusps becomes infinite, if k = a;
and if
a > k, the cusp C becomes imaginary. Likewise it is apparent from the equation that
BD as well as CE are diameters of the curve sought.
Corollary 11. [p. 398]
731. If the body in the half–oscillation has a speed corresponding to the height b, then
the arc of the descent is equal to :
(723) or through the series is equal to :
and the following arc of the ascent is equal to :
Corollary 12.
732. Hence if the descent is made from the point B, thus in order that the arc of the
descent is equal to AMB = 2kl a +k k ,
then
now the arc of the following ascent is equal to 2kl a +k k .EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 13.
733. From the equation for this curve it appears that the curve has a horizontal tangent
at the point A. Moreover since on putting ds constant, the radius of osculation at M is
equal to :
since (719) :
then the equation becomes ;
and
and the radius of osculation at M is equal to :
Hence on putting s = 0 the radius of osculation at the lowest point A = 2a. Now at B
and C the radius of osculation vanishes.
Corollary 14. [p. 399]
734. The radius of osculation is not a maximum at the lowest point A; but through the
method of maxima the maximum is found in the arc of the ascension, and that is
present at the point O :
For at this point the radius of osculation is equal to
2ak
. From which is inferred
(k 2 −a 2 )
that, unless k > a, the curvature of the curve ANC is to be continually diminished and
the point O does not exist anywhere.

735. Therefore in this problem we have found two curves, upon the first of which all
the descents are to be completed, and indeed on the second all the ascents are
completed in equal times. And while on the whole curve BAC the whole journeys or
semi–oscillations are performed in equal times, if they start from a certain portion of the curve BA, this curve is suitable for isochronous oscillations to be made in fluids,
but only if the returns also should be isochronous, concerning which there is no
agreement. [As the initial descent-ascent and the following descent-ascent are made in
opposite directions; if one is a tautochrone, then the other is not.]Moreover because in
fluids besides resistance proportional to the square of the speeds another is observed
above, that jointly with that resistance which for proportional or constant moments of
time it is probably worth the effort to determine the tautochrone, since ; because that
can be easily done from the preceding. For let the constant resistance be equal to h;
then for the descent we have :
Whereby if in the former operation in place of gdx only, everywhere gdx – hds is
substituted, a satisfying tautochrone is obtained in a like manner ; clearly for the
descent this curve is obtained : [p. 400]
and now for the ascent this equation :
which curve constitutes a continuation with the first curve; indeed the one goes into
the other on putting s negative. It is to be observed that if k = ah
, then the tautochrone
g
curve is the tractrix BAF (Fig. 82) having the horizontal asymptote CE, which is
distant from the point A by the interval AE = 2ak . Moreover the length of the thread ,
2
by which the tractrix is described, is equal to 2k.
But because above with the curve of this kind never having a horizontal tangent
the semi–oscillation can be completed and somewhere a point of equilibrium A exists,
it is no wonder as now we have observed above, that in such a hypothesis of the
resistance the body is able to stop at some place on the slope. Moreover in these cases,
in which the curve is allowed to descend beyond A, there is no return and thus no
oscillations can be performed, since the body is able to come to rest somewhere on the
inclined plane, yet is unable to ascend above that ; for in some part of the curve AF the
body is able to remain at rest.

736. The solution of the problem is not made much more difficult, if the force tending
downwards is not constant, but P is made variable somehow, and the exponent of the
resistance also is put as the variable q . Indeed there is had for the element of time in
the descent :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

If now there is put as before (719) 
there also corresponds :
Which equation differentiated again on putting ds constant and with this value
substituted in place of dt there is given :
for the curve having the isochronous descent. And the continuation of this curve
beyond A serves as the ascent curve.

737. I first gave this tautochrone according to the hypothesis of resistance proportional
to the square of the speeds in Book IV of the Commentaries [of the St. Petersburg Ac.
of Sc.;E013 in these translations], in which I have used the same method here. Since
then also the Cel. Joh. Bernoulli has signified to me by letter that he too has found the
same tautochrone for the same hypothesis of the resistance [See the letter from Joh.
Bernoulli 27 Dec. 1729 given to Leonhard Euler, that G. Enestrom published in the
Biblioth. Mathem. 4, 1903, p.378. Note by P. St. in the O. O.]; the method of which
can be seen in the Comm. Acad.Paris. A 1730 [Joh. Bernoulli, Méthode pour trouver
les tautochrones, dans les milieaux résistans comme le quarré des vitesses, Mém. de
l'acad. d. sc. de Paris 1730, p. 78; Opera Omnia, Book. 3, Lausannae et Genevae 1742,
p. 173.]. Now for other hypotheses of the resistance with that exception, in which it is
proportional to the speeds, nobody to date as far as I know has determined the
tautochrones. For that which pertained to these curves , to which I gave name of
tautochrones in the Act. Lips. A. 1726 [E001], did not give a satisfactory answer to
this question, as the Cel. Hermann, who first fell upon the same, and I afterwards,
have shown. [Jac. Hermann, General theory of the motion, which arises from any
forces acting constantly on bodies, Comment. Acad. Sc. Petrop. 2 (1727), p. 139; see
in particular p. 158.] But the difficulty of this method of finding tautochrones rests of
this, that [p. 402] from other hypotheses of the resistance the speed cannot generally
be determined from the canonical equations. Now how nevertheless the tautochrones
are able to be investigated for other resistances of the tautochrones, can be gathered
from the following proposition, in which it is proposed how for the rarest mediums
with the resistance in some ratio of the speeds the tautochrones are to be found.
