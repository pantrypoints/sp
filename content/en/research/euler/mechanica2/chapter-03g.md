PROPOSITION 82. Problem.

738. In the rarest medium, which resists in some ratio of the powers of the speeds,
and according to the hypothesis of a uniform force acting downwards, to determine
the tautochrone curve AM (Fig. 80), upon which either all the descents or all the
ascents are completed in equal times.

Solution.

With the abscissa AP = x and the arc AM = s let
the whole arc of some descent be equal to f. The
force acting downwards is equal to g, the height
corresponding to the speed at M is equal to v, the
exponent of the resistance is equal to k and the force
m
of the resistance itself is v m , where k is some very
k
large quantity, thus in order that fractions, which in
the denominator k have a dimension greater than m
can be taken as vanishing. With these in place, from
the nature of the descent, it follows that [p. 403] :
m
dv = − gdx + v mds .
k
Now evidently if the resistance is absent then the curve sought is a cycloid, the
equation of which is given by :
gx = αs 2 ;
moreover since the medium is the rarest, the curve sought does not differ much from a
cycloid; therefore this equation is put in place for the curve sought:
gx = αs 2 +

with this integral thus taken, so that it vanishes on putting s = f. Therefore,

with terms again to be omitted on account of the reason mentioned. The time is now
produced from this equation:
which is integrated, so that it vanishes on putting s = 0, and which gives the time in
which the descending body completes the arc MA = s. Therefore the time of the decent
is found for the arc f, if we put s = f after the integration ; since the time must be
constant or thus made so that it does not depend on f. Moreover the first term of the
time expansion:EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

on putting s = f after the integration, now gives an expression of this kind, in which f
is no longer present ; indeed π is produced. On account of which, if the two
2 α
remaining terms are thus to be prepared, so that on putting s = f, they cancel each
other out, then the question is satisfied ; and indeed this expression π is obtained
2 α
for the time of the descent, which is constant. Hence it must the case that :
on putting s = f after the integration. But [p. 405]
on putting s = f on integrating, gives a multiple of the power of f, and the exponent of
this is n – 2, and the other integral
on putting s = f gives a multiple of the power of f, the exponent of this is 2m – 1.
Therefore on making n = 2m + 1 and β thus taken in order that these two powers of f,
the exponent of each of which is 2m – 1, cancel each other out. From which we
conclude, moreover, it is apparent that such coefficients of these powers of f are to be
had for the simpler cases. Therefore it is found, for the following formulas on
integration, in order that they vanish on putting s = 0, and then on putting s = f :
and hence in general this becomes :
from which :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

The coefficient of the other term is known by the same reasoning. For with the
integration thus put in place, so that the integral vanishes on putting s = 0, [and on
setting s = f] through the series :
Therefore this series multiplied by
and integrated, and then on putting s = f gives :
Therefore with these two values equal to each other, there is produced : [p. 406]
and with this value substituted in place of β , the following equation is obtained for
the tautochrone curve pertaining to the descent, hence on putting 1a in place of the
homogeneous term α ,
And the time of any one descent on this curve is equal to π 2α , or the length for the
pendulum in vacuo, with natural gravity acting equal to 1 to complete the descent in
the same time, is equal to a2 . Likewise the equation for the tautochrone curve is
modified in the equation for the curve, upon which all the ascents in equal times are
completed, clearly in the time π 2α , if in place of k m is written – k m . Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
739. If 2m + 1 > 2 or m > 12 , the radius of osculation of the curve at the point A is the

same as that for the equation gx = sa , clearly 2 . Therefore in these cases the
minimum descent is completed in the same time as in vacuo; or the descent on theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

lowest of the smallest part of the same infinitely small part likewise both in vacuo and
in a resisting medium, but only if m > 12 .
Corollary 2. [p. 407]
740. If m = 12 , in each term s has the dimensions 2. Whereby the radius of osculation
ga
at A is not greater than 2 , but is less than that value. Therefore in a medium which
resists in the ratio of the speeds, the descent time is a minimum along a circular arc
greater than in vacuo and thus in the ratio given.
Corollary 3.
741. If m should be < 12 , yet now > 0, then the radius of osculation is infinitely small
at A ; hence upon this curve in vacuo the smallest descent is completed in an infinitely
small time, as is made in a finite time in a resisting medium.
Scholium 1.
742. Since as concerns the case m < 12 , as we have said, this indeed follows from the
equation that we put in place, and provides a satisfactory answer for the question in
the rarest medium. In the case moreover in which m < 12 , the three terms from which
the equation is constructed are not satisfied, even if the medium is the rarest. For the
two terms which are equal to gx, must be considered as the two initial terms of
converging series, in which the terms following vanish before the first. Now the whole
series of this kind has the form : [p. 408]
in which the exponents of s in are progression in an arithmetical progression ; and this
form can be gathered partly from analogy, partly from that reason that we have used to
find the second term. Now from this form it is apparent that the condition of the curve
cannot be known from the two first terms at the lowest point A, if m < 12 , no matter
how great k should be. For since the exponents of s decrease, yet in the following
terms, s changes in the denominator and thus putting s = 0 makes x =∝ , from which it
is apparent that the curve does not terminate in these cases at A and nor can the radius
of osculation be defined in this place. Which inconvenience does not occur, if the
exponents of s are increasing.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

743. Hence it is therefore apparent the manner in which a tautochrone curve can be
found, in a medium resisting in some power of the ratio of the speeds, even if the
medium is not the most rare. Since indeed the equation for the tautochrone is of this
form :
as from the condition of tautochronism we have determined the value of the
coefficient A, in the same manner also the coefficients of the remaining terms can be
defined. But on account of so many formulas being composed, the labour of the
integration becomes almost insurmountable, but it is perhaps of help if only a single
coefficient from which B, or at the most two, B and C need to be applied in the
determination, since the following can be concluded by analogy. [p. 409] It happens in
the case in which m = 1, that this series becomes known, and clearly from above (724)
we have :
that bring more than a little help in finding the general series. Now the term B must be
found from the following equation :
thus the integrals of this equation are to be taken so that they vanish on putting s = f,
on which being done it is necessary to put s = 0; and then the value of B can be found.
Now the coefficient A thus has become known; for we have found that
1
For the case in which m = 1, I have extracted the above equation and found that B = 48
in taking A = 16 , which agrees uncommonly well. But if the values of the coefficients
are to be known indefinitely, then a certain constant equation should be found for theEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

known, by using my method of summing series [L. Euleri Commentatio 25 (E25) :
General method of summing progressions, Comment. acad. sc. Petrop. 6 (1732/3),
1738; L. Euleri Opera Omnia, series 1, vol. 14.] it is possible to transform the
equation of the terms into a finite constant number.[p. 410] And this I judge to be
about the safest method, and with the help of this, the tautochrones in other hypotheses
of the resistance can be found.
Corollary 4.
744. Therefore if the equation :
expresses the tautochrone of the descent, then the tautochrone of the ascent is
produced by this curve :
which arises on putting k m negative.
Corollary 5.
745. Hence it is evident that whenever m is a whole number, so the tautochrone
serving for the ascents ANC (Fig. 83) is a continuation of the tautochrone of the
descent BMA. Indeed the same equation arises, and either k m or s is put negative.
Corollary 6.
746. It is understood besides that the curve ANC, upon which all the ascents are
completed in the same time in which the descents on the curve BMA, is less than the
curve BMA and the cusp C to have a higher place, as in the medium that resists in the
ratio of the square of the speeds.
Corollary 7. [p. 411]
747. In the medium that resists in the simple ratio of the speeds, all the exponents of s
are made equal to 2; from which it follows that the tautochrone of the descents as of
the ascents are semi-cycloids. Now that [curve] for the ascent, since s2 has a smaller
coefficient than for the descent, has been generated by a greater circle, if indeed the
times of the ascent are to be equal to the times of the descent. Now meanwhile the
same cycloid produces successive semi-oscillations also; now the times of the ascents
are smaller than the times of the descents.

whole number, it is more difficult to show the value of A ; indeed the series of values

value of A can be defined through the quadrature of the circle. For on putting π for the
perimeter of the circle, of which the diameter is 1, it becomes as follows :

Corollary 8.
749. If now for the individual mediums of the rarest resistances the tautochrones of the
descents are sought, these themselves are obtained, as follows:
From these the tautochrones of the ascents are formed, if the last terms become
negative.
Scholion 4. [p. 413]
750. These are therefore sufficient for the simple tautochrones, upon which either all
the descents only or all the ascents are completed in equal times. But as well as these
curves, also other curves can be called tautochrones, upon which either all the semi-
oscillations or even all the whole oscillations are isochronous; the number of which
curves as in vacuo is infinite. But since it pertains to whole oscillations, this question
of the resistance is appropriate; indeed in vacuo all the semi-oscillations are equal to
each other. But since for these questions two curves are proposed to be found, of
which the first pertains to the ascent, and the second to the descent, before we solve
questions of this kind for tautochronism, we present other easer propositions regarding
the ascent and descent of curves.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

751. According to the hypothesis of a uniform force acting downwards and a uniform
medium that resists in the square ratio of the speeds, for the given curve MA (Fig. 84)
to find the other curve AN of this kind joined to that at A, in order that the body
descending on some arc MA on the given curve by ascending on the curve sought
completes the arc AN which is equal to the arc MA.
Solution. [p. 414]
On putting the force acting g,
with the exponent of the
resistance k and with the speed at
A, that it has acquired from the
descent on the given curve, on
each sought curve the ascent AN
begins, corresponding to the
height b, for the given curve let
the abscissa AP = x, the arc
AM = s ; for the sought curve
now let the abscissa AQ = t and
the arc AN = r. With these in
place the height corresponding to
the speed of the descending body at M is equal to :
and the height corresponding to the speed of the ascending body at N is equal to :
Therefore the descent of the whole arc comes about from this equation :
now the whole arc of the ascending body comes from this equation :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

page 610
Therefore between the arc of the descent and the arc of the ascent, we have this
equation :
or the differential of this :
But since the curve MA is given, the equation is given between s and x; from which, if
in place of dx the value of this replaced by s and ds, the equation is produced between
t and s or between t and r since r = s; which determines the nature of the curve sought
AN. Q.E.I.
Corollary1. [p. 415]
752. If the lower part of the given curve MA is expressed by the equation x = αs n ,
then for the lower part of the curve AN there is this equation :
dt = αne k s n −1ds ,
Now indeed because the smallest arc s is given by :
−2 s
−2 s
e k = 1 − 2ks ,
thus it becomes :
or only t = αs n . Therefore the smallest parts of each curve are similar to each other.
Corollary 2.
−2 s
k
753. From the equation e dx = dt it is understood that always dt < dx or t < x.
Therefore the point N is always put lower than the corresponding point M. From which
it follows that the curve AN bends less towards AB than the curve AM.
Corollary 3.
754. On this account the curve ANC cannot be similar and equal to the curve AM,
since in this case the points M and N are equal to the arcs AM and AN with the ends to
be placed at the same height.
Corollary 4.
755. If the body on the curve MA descends from an infinite height, since at A it has
acquired only a finite speed, then it is able to ascend to a finite altitude only. Therefore
in this case, since the curve AM is extended to infinity, the curve ANC is unable to
ascend beyond a certain height, or has a horizontal asymptote BC. Is also apparent
from this that if one puts s =∝ ; then indeed there is produced dt = 0.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

756. As it is understood from this proposition, how the curve of ascent AN can be
found from the given curve of descent MA, thus hence in turn it is easy from the given
curve AN to define the other. If indeed the equation is given between t and s, then

is the equation for the curve AM.
Corollary 5.
757. Since the curve of the ascents AN corresponds to the curve of the descents MA,
the equation of this is :

dt = e k dx ,
thus, if this curve AN is taken for the curve of the descents, the corresponding abscissa

Example 1.
760. Let the given line be the right vertical line ; then we have x = s. Hence ANE is
sought for the curve of the ascension (Fig.
85) on assuming AQ = t and AN = s this
equation is obtained :
And with the exponential quantity
eliminated, then the equation is :
From which equation it is evident that the curve ANE is a tractrix arising from a string
of length 12 k upon the asymptote to the horizontal BD. Whereby the height AB of the
asymptote is then equal to 12 k . Now if this tractrix ANE is itself taken for the curve of
descent then to that there corresponds the curve sought, the abscissa of this
∫
−4 s
corresponding to the arc s is equal to e k ds ; [p. 418] which curve therefore is again
a tractrix having a horizontal asymptote, of which the asymptote has been raised by
the interval 14 k above A, to which the length of the string is equal. Now all the curves
of the above series are tractrices which are generated by strings of which the lengths
constitute this series : k0 , k2 , k4 , k6 etc. Clearly the vertical straight line is to be
considered as the tractrix of which the generating string is k0 or infinite. Moreover the
last of this series of tractrices becomes the horizontal straight line drawn through A.
Example 2.
761. If the line of the descents is a straight line MA inclined in some manner to the
horizontal (Fig. 85), thus in order that MA (s): AP (x) = α :1 or dx = ds

is obtained for the curve sought AN :

and the integral of this is :

Which is also the equation for generating the above tractrix, with a string of
length k2 with the horizontal asymptote BD , on taking AB = 2kα ; and this tractrix must
pass through A. The following curves of the series are all tractrices also, as in the
preceding example, of which the generating strings are k0 , k2 , k4 , k6 etc. , now of these
asymptotes the distances from the point A are held in this progression [p.
419] 0kα , 2kα , 4kα , 6kα etc. Clearly all these tractrices make an angle with the vertical
axis AB equal to the angle PAM.
Corollary 8.
762. Of these tractrices that, which first or precedes the line MA, hence has this
property that the body descending on that afterwards ascending on the line AM
traverses equal distances.
Corollary 9.
763. Therefore according to the curve of the
descents CA (Fig. 86) to be found, to that
corresponds the right inclined line AM, above
the asymptote to the horizontal, the tractrix
CA is described by a string of length k2 and on
that the applied line Ab = 2kα is taken, and
from A the right inclined line AM is
constructed ; and then CA is the curve of the
descents, to which there corresponds the line
AM for the ascents.

which from a given curve of the ascents the curve of the descents is required.

This proposition differs from
the preceding in this, that there
the curve MA is given; now here
that also must be found from this

Moreover since the curve MAN must be continuous, thus it is necessary to compare the
equation between s and x, in order that, if in that equation in place of s there is put – s ,
in which case the arc AM becomes the arc AN , then the value of x becomes equal to t,

With these values substituted in place of M and N there is produced Q = – P . From

putting – s in place of s, which functions I have become accustomed to call odd. And

this becomes on taking logarithms :

This equation is differentiated again on putting ds and there is produced :
Which equation is free from exponentials.
Corollary 2.
769. Since P must be given in terms of s, the equation found does not have mixed
variables; on account of which this is sufficient for the curves contained in that
equation to be constructed.

which is the equation for perhaps the single most simple satisfactory curve. Now this

equation on eliminating the exponential e k changes into this :
s
Or by setting out e k in a series, this equation is produced :

a. Because it is necessary that dx < ds, it is necessary that e k s < a . Which therefore
s
with this in place becomes e k s , which expression with s increasing also increases, to
equal a, where the curve AM has a vertical tangent and the point of returning. For the
branch AN put – s in place of + s and this equation is obtained :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Whereby as long as it is the case that e k s < a , the curve does not become imaginary.

But if at any point e k s = a , there the curve also has a point of reversion and a vertical
diameter. [p. 424] But is always possible to happen, if a is taken large enough, that
−s
e k s is always less than a, in which case the curve AN goes to infinity and has a

horizontal asymptote BC. But e k s = 0 in the cases when s = 0 and s =∝ ; hence it has
a maximum value, if the differential of this is equal to zero; now in this case it
becomes fit k = s and

s
BA is equal to ka . But if it is the case that a < ke , then the curve AN using the other

branch also has a point of reversion, which is determined from this equation : a = e k s .

this is brought about in order that the two integrals
become equal to each other, if after integration there is put X = b and T = b. But S and
R as both X and T are clearly quantities not depending on b and they must have the
same relation between each other, whatever value b may have. Therefore what is
sought is satisfied, if R is such a function of T, as S of X. Or on taking R = S there also

774. Since it is the case that s = −2kl (2 − e 2k ) , then
thus an easier relation can be taken in the computation between ds and dx.

776. Towards investigating the form of the curve around the point A , s and r are

placed very small and then e 2 k = 1 , hence dr becoming equal to ds and dt = dx. From
which it is evident that the lowest parts of the curves MA and NA are similar and equal
to each other.
Example 1.
777. Let the given line of the descents be the
right line MA (Fig. 85) at some inclination, in
order that s = αx or ds = αdx . Now since we
have

Which equation converted into a series gives :
and thus at the lowest point A it is the case that dr = αdt . This curve has a horizontal
r
tangent somewhere, which place is found on putting dt = 0; now then 2 = e 2 k or
r = 2kl 2 , to which there corresponds αt = 2k − 2kl 2 . And if r becomes greater than
2kl 2 , the value of dt is made negative and thus the curve again descends, while – dt
becomes equal to dr; but this happens, if the equation is
[p. 429] But since α cannot be less than 1, then if α = 1 , then the vertical tangent from
A stands apart, and if α > 1 , then there is no vertical tangent beyond the horizontal
tangent. But otherwise [?] beyond the tangent there is obtained a vertical, where it is
the case that
Hence in this case, in which the given line is vertical or α = 1 , then r = 0 or the
tangent at A is vertical.
Corollary 6.
778. If s denotes the whole length of the arc of descent, r expresses the whole arc
described on the curve AN (Fig. 84) from the following ascent. Whereby if the arc of
the descent s is given, the arc of the ascent can be found :
For since when we put T = X, the letters s and r denote the whole arcs of the descent
and of the ascent.
Example 2.
779. Let the given curve MA be the tautochrone of the descents, that we have
previously found for the same hypothesis of the resistance; the curve AN has this
property, that all the ascents are also completed in equal times, clearly the same by
which the descents are completed on MA. Whereby the curve AN is a tautochrone of
the ascents with the curve MA found before now continued. Moreover so that this can
be shown from that calculation, we take the equation for the tautochrone curve of the
descents, which is (719) [p. 430]

Which equation is formed from the former, if t is put in place of x and – r for s.
Whereby this curve AN has been continued, and with MA the tautochrone of the
ascents.

Corollary 7.

780. Hence with the arc of the descent s given on the tautochrone of the descents, then
the arc of the following ascent is the tautochrone of the ascents :
And if the descent begins from the cusp of the tautochrone, the place of this is given
by :
(729), and the arc of the ascent is :
as we have found above (732).

781. And thus since the tautochrone according to this hypothesis of the resistance
satisfies the question and the curve is continued, hence we can seize the handle and
more continuous curves can be investigated, of which the two branches of the curves
in turn MA and AN are able to be sustained – which we present in the following
proposition.
