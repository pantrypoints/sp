PROPOSITION  86. Problem.

782. With everything put in place as before, to find the case in which the two curves
MA and AN (Fig. 84) constitute a single continuous curve, upon which the descent and
the following ascent are completed in equal times.

Solution.

With the same denominations in place,
as we have used in the previous
proposition, clearly AP = x, AM = s, AQ
= t and AN = r, besides the two equations
found there :
r
−s
−s
r
2 = e 2 k + e 2 k and e k dx = e k dt ,
it has to be put into effect that both the
equation between s and x, and between r
and t are understood in terms of the same
equation. According to this, we take a
new variable z, from which the point M on the curve AM can be determined, thus in
order that, if z becomes negative, then likewise the point N is obtained on the other
curve. Hence on this account it is required that s be a function of z of this kind, in
order that likewise, if – z is put in place of z , the arc AN is given, which on account of
being made negative, is – r, thus so that s becomes – r on putting – z in place of z.

[Thus, in modern notation, s ( z ) = s and s (− z ) = −r .] [So that this can be done,] there
is put in place
−s
e 2k = 1 + Q ;
then
r
e 2k = 1 − Q
r
−s
since 2 = e 2 k + e 2 k , and thus Q is an odd function of z, since Q becomes negative on
making z negative.

Hence the equations become :
−s
r
e k = (1 + Q) 2 and e k = (1 − Q) 2 .
Again moreover it must be the case that :
dx(1 + Q) 2 = dt (1 − Q) 2
and x must be such a function of z, which changes into t on putting z negative.
[Thus x( z ) = x and x(− z ) = t , while Q(− z ) = −Q .]
Put dx = Mdz and M changes to N on making z negative; hence dt = –Ndz. On account
etc., and is not related to the points M and N above on the
of which [note that M = dx
dz
diagram] :
M (1 + Q)2 = − N (1 − Q) 2 .
Hence :
M = P(1 − Q) 2
with P also made equal to an odd function of z; and then likewise
N = − P(1 + Q) 2
and thus there is the same equality between M (1 + Q) 2 and − N (1 − Q) 2 , as is
required. Therefore for argument's sake on accepting odd functions of z in place of P
and Q then
∫
dx = Pdz (1 − Q) 2 or x = Pdz (1 − Q) 2
and
s = 2kl 1+1Q .

Hence innumerable curves MA arise, of which the continued parts of the ascent AN
produce isochrones with respect to the descents made on MA. Moreover two functions
P and Q occur, in order that if Q = – z then the other is determined; for then
s = 2kl 1−1 z and x = Pdz (1 + z ) 2 .
∫
In the second equation of which the value of z from the first is substituted, which is
−s
1 − e 2 k , and the equation between x and s for the curve sought is obtained. Q.E.I.
Corollary 1.
783. If z = 0, then also s becomes equal to 0. Whereby the integral of Pdz (1 + z ) 2 thus
must be taken, so that it vanishes on putting z = 0. For with the arc s vanishing, the
abscissa x also has to vanish.
Corollary 2. [p. 433]
784. Since it is the case that s = 2kl 1−1 z , then
ds = 21kdz
−z


2
and since dx = Pdz (1 + z ) , then
therefore unless P (1 - z 2 )(1 + z ) is greater than 2k, the curve is real.
Corollary 3.
785. At the lowest point A, since z vanishes, then
ds 2k
= .
dx P
Where P must be such an odd function of z, in order that, if z = 0, it must be less than
2k; moreover this cannot come about, unless P is such a function of z that vanishes on
putting z = 0, and in this case the tangent at A is horizontal.
Example 1.
786. Since P must be an odd function of z, there is put in place P =
az
(1− z 2 ) 2
.

On putting this in place, we then have :
Now
With which substituted, there is obtained :
Which is the equation for the tautochrone curve found above, upon a part of this curve
MA all the descents are completed in the same time, and moreover all the ascents are
completed in the same time on the other part AN.

788. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity acting downwards and for a
uniform medium with resistance in the ratio of the square of the speeds, if some curve
is given MA (Fig. 87), upon which the descending body completes the descent, to find
a suitable curve AN joined to that for the ascent, such that all the semi-oscillations
which are made on the curve MAN are completed in equal times.

Solution.

With the force acting g put in
place as up to this point, and with
the exponent of the resistance k,
let the abscissa of the given curve
MA be AP = x, the arc AM = s,
the abscissa of the sought curve
AQ = t, and the arc AN = r. [p.
435] Now the descent begins at
some point A of the curve MA
and let the speed acquired at A
correspond to the height b, with
which [initial] speed the body completes the following ascent on the curve AN. With
these in place the height of the descending body corresponding to the speed at M is
equal to :

From these the time, in which the arcs MA and AN of the semi–oscillation are
traversed, is equal to :
and this whole expression gives the time of the semi–oscillation, if after integration
there is put in place :
Therefore since this time must always have the same constant value, which does not
depend on the letter b, from this condition the equation can be determined between t
and r with the help of the given equation between x and s. For the sake of brevity we
put :
and
With these substituted,
must have a constant value, if on integrating there is put in place X = b and T = b.
Therefore generally T = X is put in place, since T does not depend on X ; we have this
expression for the time :
which thus must be compared, so that after the integration on making X = b the letter b
clearly vanishes from the calculation. But this is done if  for the time of the semi–oscillation is equal to :

from which the construction of the curve becomes known. But the equation for the
curve sought AN is more conveniently found from the given equation between x and s,

and this value in place of x :
For with these substituted the equation arises between r and t, which is sought for the
curve AN. Q.E.I. [p. 437]
Corollary 1.
789. Since the smallest oscillations agree with the oscillations in vacuo, if the tangent
to the curve MA at A is horizontal or the radius of osculation at A becomes infinitely
small, the radius of osculation of the curve sought AN is 4f at A. [See the notes to E001
in this series of translations for an explanation of the appearance of 4f here.] For in this
case the time of the shortest descent is equal to 0 and the time of the ascent is equal to
π 2f
g
.
Corollary 2.
790. But if the radius of osculation of the curve MA at A radius is of finite magnitude,
such as h, then the time of minimum descent is equal to π 2h (166). Therefore since
g
the time of the semi–oscillation is equal to
π 2f
g
, the radius of oscillation of the
curve AN at A is equal to (2 f - h ) 2 ; but this must h < 4f or f > 14 h , lest the curve
AN becomes imaginary.
Corollary 3.
791. Therefore the curves MA and AN have both a common horizontal tangent and
radius of osculation at A, if f = h. For in this case the radius of osculation of the curve
AN at A also becomes equal to h.
Scholium 1.
792. As here from the given curve of the descents we have determined the curve of the
ascents, thus in a similar manner it is evident that it is possible to find the curve of the
descents from the given curve of the ascents ; if indeed the equation is given between t
and r, since it is [p. 438]

page 652
with these values being substituted, the equation for the curve of the descents between
s and x is obtained.
Corollary 4.
793. Since f is able to have innumerable values, as long as f > 14 h , to some given
curve either of the descents or of the ascents innumerable curves of this kind can be
adjoined, so that the semi–oscillations made upon these are all isochronous, generally
possible to be used in vacuo.
Corollary 5.
794. Since in the solution we have put T = X, this relation is contained in an equation
between some arc of the descent and the arc of the corresponding ascent. Thus, if the
arc of the descent is s, then the arc of the ascent

is also the case that ds = dx and

in which the variables are separable from each other in turn, whereby that suffices for
the construction of the curve. Now the integration of this equation depends on the
quadrature of the circle. The equation for the vacuum is elicited from this equation on
making k =∝ :
which equation can be reduced to that, that we found in the preceding chapter[466].

[719], and the equation of this is

or
where 2 f must be greater than a . But this equation found includes all the
tautochrones of the ascents ; which indeed joined with any of the tautochrones of the
descents, all the semi–oscillations on the curve composed from these must be
isochrones. If we take f = 2a, then this equation arises :
which is for the tautochrone of the ascents, upon which all the ascents are completed
in the same time as the descent on the given tautochrone of the descents, and that is by
a continuation of the tautochrone of the descents.
Example 3.
797. Let the given line of the descents MA be the tautochrone of the ascents and there
is sought, such curves when joined with produce isochronous semi–oscillations. Now
the equation for this curve MA is
Hence there is produced : [p. 441]

798. Thus we have produced this example, in order that it is apparent, where it is
required that any tautochrone of the ascents be joined with the curve, by which all the
semi–oscillations are completed in equal times. Moreover from the formulas found it
is apparent that the curve sought is not an isochrone of the descents; for the equation
is not present in these formulas, which risk in the making is at once apparent. On
account of which if MA is the tautochrone of the descents and AN of the ascents, even
if all the departures along MAN are completed in equal times, yet the return or the
following semi–oscillations along NAM are not isochrones. Therefore a pendulum,
that is made to oscillate along the curves MA and AN, does not make isochronous
oscillations, even if the other semi–oscillations in which the descent starts on the curve
[p. 442] MA , are performed in equal times. Consequently this composite curve MAN
is not suitable in being equally effective in the motion of pendulums in a resistive
medium. Now the best remedy to this inconvenience is brought forwards, if the case
can be determined, in which a curve AN similar and equal to the curve MA can be
produced.
[This revelation is at once apparent from the nature of the resistance, which changes
direction while the body returns to the starting point. Thus, carefully crafted
isochrones in one direction along the curve do not work in the other direction.]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

799. If the curves MA and AN (Fig. 87) have that property, that all the semi–
oscillations which begin on the curve MA, are between themselves isochrones in a
medium that resists in the square ratio of the speeds, to determine the case in which
these two curves MA and AN joined together constitute one continuous curve.
Solution.
With the same denominations
put in place as in the previous
proposition, clearly AP = x, AM
= s, AQ = t, AN = r , and f is
equal to the length of the
isochronous pendulum in vacuo
and with gravity equal to g, there
we found these two equations :
in which the relation between each curve is contained. Now since the curves MA and
NA must be the roots of a continuous curve, the equation between x and s thus must be
compared so that, if x changes to t, then s becomes equal to – r on account of the
negative in place. According to this we accept the new variable z, and both s and x are
such functions of this, that on making z negative, x changes to t and s to –r . Let [p.

then [above] we have
for on making z negative, in which case r is changed into –s and –s into r, then there
is produced :
which equation agrees with the former. Let P be some even function of z, which is not
changed, even if –z is put in place of z, and there is put in place :EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

changes into r and there is obtained :

; for on putting z negative and dt in place of dx and r in place of –s , there is produced :
Therefore from the variable z, of which P is some even function, the curve sought AM

Let z be become
which enables simpler formulas to be put into effect as well as producing more
convenient homogeneous equations, as u must be of a single dimension; thus P also is
an even function of u of one dimension. Whereby there is obtained :

800. Hence an infinitude of tautochronous curves MAN can be found, if from the
different values of P that can be put in place, all those substituted are even functions of

the variable u, which also is not present in P, can be eliminated.

802. Since with s vanishing, x also must vanish, the first to be investigated is that in
which u itself vanishes for a given value of s. Then the integral
thus must be taken, in order that it vanishes, if the same value is substituted in place of
u. And this is to be observed since in the construction of the curve, which can be put in
place with the help of the two equations found, then in putting together the equation
between x and s, if indeed from the equation integrated : [p. 445]EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

this can be deduced. Otherwise if in place of u and P some other multiple of these can
be put to use, in place of the two equations found these can be used :
where the constant c is arbitrary and thus in this manner can be determined, as in the
same case that s vanishes, in which x vanishes. But s vanishes if u = 0, since

and e dx vanishes on s vanishing ; whereby c must be equal to the value of P, if
u is put equal to 0 in that. Therefore in the same case x must vanish, from which the
constant in the integration of the value of x is determined. Or even in place of P such
an even function of u must be accepted, which becomes equal to c, if u is put equal to
0.
Corollary 3.
803. Since the length of the isochronous pendulum in vacuo and with gravity equal to
g is equal to f and the smallest oscillations in a medium with resistance are in

Scholium 2.
808. Which tautochronous curves we have found in these examples for a medium that
resists in the ratio of the square of the speeds, these have thus been composed so that
the arcs MA and AN are dissimilar. Therefore since all the descents must begin on the
curve MA, the following semi–oscillations, which begin on the curve NA, are not
tautochrones, and because of that these curves cannot be adapted for oscillatory
motion. But a remedy for this inconvenience is produced, if of the curves of this kind,
even similar and equal curves MA and NA are found ; for in this case descents are
likewise able to be made on each curve. Also there is no doubt that such a case exists,
and the discovery of this, since the two curves perhaps are not continued, pertain
rather to the preceding proposition. Clearly the curve of the descents must be
investigated, to which there corresponds a similar and equal curve of the ascents ; now
this investigation is thus difficult on account of deficiencies in the analysis, as I doubtEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

that the goal can be reached without the development of some outstanding analysis.
[p. 449] Now this question is thus reduced so that the equation between s and x of this
condition can be investigated, as, if in that equation is put
in place of s and
in place of x, the same equation can be produced, which was had before [788]. Indeed
this condition can be more easily effected in many ways; yet I cannot see how that
condition can be satisfied. If the medium should be the rarest, then it is not difficult
from what has been reported on, to find the case in which two curves MA et AN are
similar and equal to each other. Indeed in the end by leading through this calculation I
have found the equation
which curve likewise on being continued beyond A has the branch AN similar and
equal to the arc AM; whereby a pendulum oscillating on this curve completes single
semi–oscillations in equal times. Moreover we have :
Because now k is a very large quantity, then

Corollary 5.
809. If there is taken a = k 3 or f = 2k 3 , this curve changes into an ellipse, the
horizontal axis of which is twice as great as the vertical axis, which is equal to 2k 3 .
Hence it can happen, that an ellipse can be the tautochrone in the rarest medium and is
more satisfactory than the cycloid.
Scholium 3.
810. Moreover the construction of the tautochrone
curve in the rarest medium in the preceding
scholium has been given as follows: On the
vertical straight line AB = a = 12 f (Fig. 88) the
semicircle AOB is described, and from this on the
base BD the cycloid AFD is described; with the
same inverted in place AGD is described. With
which accomplished the curve sought AMC is
constructed by taking everywhere for the applied
lines of this :
from which ratio endless points of the curve become known. Or it is possible to take
thus so that there is no need for the cycloid. Moreover this curve has a vertical tangent
somewhere or the applied line PM is maximum, which is found on putting dy = 0.
Moreover there is produced :
if AP is taken equal to this value, then the maximum applied line is found.

Problem.

811. According to the hypothesis of gravity acting uniformly downwards g with some
given curve am (Fig. 89) for the descents in vacuo to find the curve AM for the
descents in a medium of this innate character with uniform resistance in the ratio of
the square of the speeds, in order that all the descents on MA are isochrones with
respect to all the descents on ma, if the speeds at the bottom points a and A are equal.
Solution.
Let the abscissa for the curve am of the
descents in vacuo abscissa be ap = t, the arc
am = r; now the exponent of the resistance
is put equal to k ; now for the curve of the
descents in the medium with resistance let
AP = x and AM = s; Now two descents are
considered on these curves, in which the
speeds acquired at A and a are equal and
correspond to the height b. Hence the time
of the descent in vacuo is equal to
and after integration there is put in place
gt = b. But for the time of the descent on the curve MA in the medium with resistance
there is obtained :
if likewise after the integration there is put in place :

curve MA at A and the radius of osculation at A is equal to the radius of osculation at
a. [p. 453]
Corollary 4.
815. Therefore if the curve found ma in vacuo, in which the times of the descents have
some relation to the speeds acquired at a, likewise the problems for the resisting
medium can be solved for the curve MA, which by the prescribed reason can be
constructed from the curve ma.
Corollary 5.
816. Therefore if the curve ma should be a cycloid or tautochrone in vacuo, then AM is
the tautochrone of the descents in the resisting medium found above. For on putting
r 2 = 2at or rdr = adt this equation is produced on substituting the values found in
place of r and t :

b, is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Therefore the same property is in place for the curve MA, so that the time of each
descent in the resisting medium, in which the speed b is generated, is equal to 2ng b
or in proportion to the speed arising. Moreover since r = nt, then dr = ndt; in which if
the values found are substituted in place of dr and dt, then there is produced : [p. 454]
which is the equation for the tractrix generated by the thread of length 2k, such as is

818. To the extent that this curve MA has been found, on which all the descents in the
resisting medium are completed in the same times as the descents in vacuo on the
curve ma, if the final speeds at A and a should be equal, thus in the same manner the
curve MA can be defined, upon which all the ascents in the resisting medium are
completed in the same times in which likewise with the same starting speeds of ascent
the motions are completed in vacuo on the curve am. For since for a resisting medium
the descent and the ascent can be changed into each other on making k negative, if on
putting AP = x and AM = s, there is obtained :
or conversely,
From which then the curve AM can be constructed easily from the equation to be
found for that.

819. In this problem we have determined the curve of the descent in the resisting
medium from the curve of the descent in vacuo. Moreover it is readily apparent in turn
from the given curve AM for the resisting medium the other am for the vacuum can be
found. For since it is given by :
the construction of the curve am with the help of the two equations is performed. Now
the equation for the curve am between t and r is found more conveniently from the
given equation between x and s, if there in place of x there is substituted
4k 2 dt and 2kl 2 k in place of s. Because here besides what has been said about the
2k − r
(2k − r ) 2
descents, likewise is valid for the ascents, but only if k is put negative, as we have
advised in scholium 1.

820. The devising of one curve from the other of two given curves am and AM also
has a place and is treated here, if the equation of the
given curve is not in place, but if it has been drawn
by hand in some manner; for the construction can be
deduced from the formulas, since it no longer
depends on the equation. On this account in the
preceding chapter (432), in the case we have
considered for the vacuum, in which the curve cm
(Fig. 90) that we have devised must be joined to the
given ac, so that all the descents from any point of
the curve cm as far as to a are completed in equal
times, now similar examples to these for the resisting
medium can be elicited, in which the line composed
from the two different curves is a tautochrone. For if
the curve acm is a tautochrone curve of this kind for the vacuum, from that by the
solution of this problem a like curve can be found composed for the resisting medium.
Clearly from ac by the method proposed the curve AC is defined; which is found on
putting bp = t, cm = r and BP = x and also CM = s and besides ab = a, ac = c ; AB =
A, and AC = C, for then, since the equation between t and r is given, then
and [p. 455] But if for the resisting medium the curve AC is given and there is required for
the other part of this CM the property, in order that all the descents on MCA are
completed in equal times, the solution can be effected in a not dissimilar manner. For
from the given curve AC for the resisting medium there is found the curve with the
same property for the vacuum ac by scholium 2. With which devised, there is sought
the curve cm to be joined to that, which produces all the isochronous descents in vacuo
(432). Then by the method treated in the manner according to the composite curve
acm for the vacuum there is sought a like composite curve for the resisting medium
ACM, of which indeed the part AC is now known ; clearly from that line ac we have
defined. Hence likewise the problem, in which in vacuo there was some difficulty, in
the resisting medium too can be resolved. Hence finally the chapter ends and I ask the
benevolent Reader, that before progressing to the following chapter, it may be wished
to repeat what has been presented in chapter I from § 58 to the end of the chapter.
