PROPOSITION 95.
Problem.

856. If a body moving on a surface is acted on by any forces, to define the normal forces,
evidently the normal force pressing [on the surface], the deflecting force [in the tangent
plane normal to the curve], and the force along the tangent, with all arising from
resolution.

Solution.

Whatever the forces acting should be,
these can be reduced to three forces, the
directions of which are along the three
coordinates x, y, z [at M]. Now let the force
at M (Fig. 92), drawing the body parallel to
the abscissa PA, be equal to E, the force
drawing the body parallel to the direction QP
to be equal to F, and the force drawing the
body along MQ to be equal to G. Hence the
forces are each to be resolved in turn into
three parts, clearly a normal pressing force, a
normal force of deflection [in the plane of the tangent], and a force along the tangent
[to the curve at M]. Moreover since these three directions are normal to each other, from
each of these forces E, F et G, the normal and tangential forces themselves can be
produced, if these are taken by the cosine of the angle that the directions of these forces
make with these [other directions].
We may begin with the force along the tangent, the direction of which is MT, for
which the equation arises [from Prop. 93] :
and 

Hence the cosine of the angle QMT, that the direction the force G makes with the force
along the tangent, is equal to : [p. 478]
If the force G is multiplied by this, then the tangential force due to G produced, equal to

Now the cosine of the angle that MT makes with the direction of the force F, which is
parallel to QP , is equal to
Hence the tangential force from F that has arisen is equal to
Again the cosine of the angle that the direction of the force E makes with MT, is equal toEULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

and thus the tangential force arising from E is equal to

And finally, since the force of deflection is in the direction MG : as
then the cosine of the angle that MG makes with the direction of the force G , is equal to
[p. 479] [MQ/MG in Fig. 94]:
whereby the deflecting force arising from the force G is equal to :
Again the cosine of the angle that MG makes with the direction of the force F, is equal to:
[as PG + EG is the projection of the horizontal component QG on the y-axis] on account
of which the deflecting force arising is equal to :
And then the cosine of the angle that the direction of the force E makes with MG is equal
to :
[-PE is the projection of QG on the x-axis; note that all the positive forces act along the
negative directions of their axis. ]
Hence the deflecting force arising from the force E is equal to :

Moreover since previously we have called the tangential force T, the normal pressing
force M, and the deflecting force N, we have reduced the three proposed forces E, F, and
G to these; namely
and
and
Q.E.I.

Corollary 1.

857. Therefore if the body is acted on by three forces E, F and G, on putting v for the
height corresponding to the speed at M, then
(849), if in place of T there is put the tangential force arising from the resolution of the
forces E, F and G. [As this is the only force that does work, as we now understand the
physics.]
Corollary 2. [p. 480]

858. If in addition, the body is moving in a resistive medium and the resistance at M is
equal to R, then (850)
Corollary 3.

859. If, in the equation (851) found, in which the effect of the deflecting force N has been
determined, in place of N the deflecting force arising from the resolution of the forces E,
F and G is substituted, then there is produced :

Corollary 4.

860. Therefore if the two equations are solved together with the elimination of v, the
equation is produced, which joined with the local equation for the surface
dz = Pdx + Qdy , determines the path described on the surface by the body.
Corollary 5.

861. Moreover the force by which the surface is pressed along its normal, both by the
normal pressing force M as well as the centrifugal force that has arisen, is equal to:
(845), on substituting the value found in place of M.

Corollary 6.

862. Now from the equation in corollary 3, it has been found that
in which with the value substituted there, the total pressing force is equal to [p. 481] :
Scholium.

863. Since the three forces E, F, G have directions normal to each other in turn, the
equivalent force from these is equal to ( E 2 + F 2 + G 2 ) . Now we have found the three
forces M, N and T to be equivalent to these three forces, the directions of which also are
normal to each other in turn ; whereby from these three, the equivalent force is equal to
( M 2 + N 2 + T 2 ) . On account of which, if in place of M, N and T the values found from
E, F and G are substituted, there must be produced ( E 2 + F 2 + G 2 ) ; which is the thing
to have checked in setting up a calculation. Moreover this serves the part of a criterion,
however involved the calculation, by completely resolving the question that the solution
has been rightly or wrongly set up. Now from this criterion these formulae are found to
be correctly established.

864. According to the hypothesis of gravity g acting downwards uniformly, to determine
the line that a body projected on some surface in vacuo describes.
Solution. [p. 482]
Let APQ (Fig. 92) be a horizontal plane and the point
M is given both on the surface, and on the line described
by the body. Hence MQ is vertical and therefore in the
direction of the force of gravity g. On putting AP = x, PQ
= y and QM = z and with the equation expressing the
nature of the surface dz = Pdx + Qdy let the speed at M,
in which the element Mm is traversed, correspond to the
height v. Therefore as this problem is a case of the
preceding, for it becomes G = g, E = 0 and F = 0, these
two equations are obtained : dv = − gdz (857) and
(859). Again let a height equal to b correspond to the speed that the body is to have, if it
arrives in the horizontal plane APQ; then v = b − gz . Now through the other equation :

Hence it becomes :
Which equation with the help of the equation dz = Pdx + Qdy is changed into this :
which integrated gives :
Therefore in which a special case has to be investigated, or can be integrated. If that happens, then v is obtained by differentials of the first degree,
and since it is v = b − gz , an equation of the differential of the first degree arises
expressing the nature of the described curve. Now the pressing force on the surface along
the normal is equal to :

which with the differentials of the second order removed, (861) changes into this :
Q.E.I.

Corollary 1. [p. 483]

865. Hence the speed of any motion the body according to the hypothesis of uniform
gravity g directed downwards can be known on some surface can become known from
the height only, as if everywhere the body is moving in the same plane.
Corollary 2.

866. If the minute time, in which the element Mm is completed, is put as dt, then
Hence by the equation found, we have:

Corollary 3.

867. From these equations uncovered, it is found that :

particular cases, in which a certain kind of surfaces is considered, to which we add
examples of individual surfaces. [p. 484]

Problem.

869. According to the hypothesis of uniform gravity g acting downwards, to determine
the motion of a body on the surface of cylinder of any kind, the axis of which is vertical.
Solution.
Because the axis of the cylinder is put as vertical, all the sections are equal to each
other; therefore let ABQC (Fig. 95) be the base of the cylinder, on the surface of which
the body is moving. Putting AP = x, PQ = y and let z be the height of the body at the
point Q on the surface of the cylinder. Hence the
nature of this surface of the cylinder is expressed by
this equation: 0 = Pdx + Qdy or Qdy = − Pdx .
Moreover this equation arises from the general
equation dz = Pdx + Qdy , if P and Q are made
infinitely large quantities, or with the coefficient of
dz vanishing, if we may assume this. On account of
which in the equations found before, P and Q must be
considered as infinitely large quantities, even if they
are quantities of finite magnitude [i. e. relative to
each other; recall that P = ∂∂xz and Q = ∂∂yz , here with a negative sign.] Moreover P and Q
are functions of x et y only, and nor is z is present in these. Therefore from these there is
obtained from the deductions in the calculation :

Now the pressing force that the surface sustains, arises only from the centrifugal force

expression is positive. Q.E.I. [p. 486]
[There was at the time, and even now, unfortunately, the notion held by some people that
bodies try to flee from the centre when involved in circular motion, and that seems to
have originated with Huygens in his Horologium. The reader may wish to compare
Euler's early solutions with more modern solution to these and further problems, such as
presented by Whittaker in his Analytical Dynamics, in Ch. 4, The Soluble Problems of
Particle Dynamics. ]
Corollary 1.
870. Therefore the curve, that the body describes on the surface of the cylinder if the
surface is set out as a plane, changes into a parabola, clearly that trajectory that a body
describes in the vertical plane.
Corollary 2.
871. If the motion of the body on the surface of the cylinder is considered to be composed
from a vertical motion, as it progresses either up or down, and from the horizontal, then
the horizontal motion is uniform, since the times t are proportional to
∫ (dx + dy ) , i. e.

to the arcs traversed in the horizontal motion. Now the vertical motion is either
uniformly accelerated or decelerated.
Corollary 3.
872. Hence if the horizontal motion vanishes, then the body either ascends or descends
along a straight line, and generally if the body can freely ascend or descend. And this
case is produced if c = 0, when
∫ (dx + dy ) vanishes.

Example. [p. 487]
873. Let the base of the cylinder be a circle, the quadrant of which is BQC and the radius
AB = a; then the equation is x 2 + y 2 = a 2 and xdx + ydy = 0. Hence the equations become
P = x and Q = y = (a 2 − x 2 ) . Now the projection of the line described by this on the
surface of the cylinder in the vertical plane erected from AC, is expressed by the equation
:
Therefore if we set c = 0, then dx = 0 and x is constant; whereby in this case the
projection is a straight line. Now the curve, which is the projection for whatever value of
c, is constructed with the help of the rectification of the circle. Moreover the pressing
force, that the surface of the cylinder sustains, is equal to
on account of the equation
Whereby the pressing force is constant everywhere and proportional to c.

874. On account of the same equation the pressing force generally that any cylinder
sustains,

875. But not only can the motion of a body on the surface of an erect cylinder be easily
determined with the help of resolution, but also, if the axis of the cylinder should be
horizontal, with the same ease the motion of the body becomes known. And indeed if the
body does not have a horizontal motion along the cylinder, then the body perpetually
remains on the same section of the cylinder as that is moving on a given line. But if now
the motion is agreed to be horizontal, this remains the same always and does not disturb
the other motion; and from these motions taken together the motion of the body truly
becomes known easily.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

876. If a body is moving on the surface of a solid of revolution, of which the axis is the
vertical line AL (Fig. 96), in vacuo with gravity g acting uniformly, to determine the
motion of the body on a surface of this kind.
Solution.
The solid of revolution is generated by the rotation of
the curve AM about the vertical axis AL; all the sections
of this are horizontal circles, of which the radii are
applied lines of the curve AM. Therefore the equation
expressing the nature of this surface is dz =
xdx + ydy
,
Z
with Z some function z; indeed it is given by :
∫
2 Zdz = x 2 + y 2 = LM 2 .
Therefore if the equation is given between AL = z
and LM = 2 Zdz for the curve AM , then Z is also given. [p. 489] With these put in

place, therefore P = Zx and Q = Z ; from which values if substituted the two following
equations are obtained, from which the described curve as well as the motion on that
surface become known :

Whereby this becomes :
Putting x 2 + y 2 = u 2 ; the function u is a certain function of z, clearly

u 2 = 2 Zdz ,

∫ (dx + dy ) . Moreover in the vertical plane the

which equation, if it is divided by u, allows the construction. Now the pressing force, that
the surface sustains towards the axis, is equal to :
Q.E.I.
Corollary1.
877. If the increment of the time in which the element Mm is completed, is put as dt, then

Corollary 2. [p. 490]
878. If the body is considered to be moving in the projection in the horizontal plane, then
the speed of this at Q corresponds to the height
from which motion in the projection the motion on the surface itself can be found.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 3.
879. Therefore let BQC (Fig. 97) be the projection of the
curve in the horizontal plane, in which the body is
moving, thus so that the motion of this corresponds to the
motion of the body on the surface itself; the time in

Corollary 5.
881. Therefore the body moving in the projection likewise is moving on that surface, and
if it is moving freely attracted by some centripetal force to the centre A (Book I. (587)).
Corollary 6. [p. 491]
882. The point B corresponds to the start of the motion made on the surface, and since the
direction for the first motion on the surface is given, the perpendicular to the tangent at B
is given. Therefore let AB = f and the perpendicular to the tangent is equal to h ; then the
3
height corresponding to the speed at B is equal to c 2 .

Corollary 7.
883. Therefore the centripetal force tending towards A, which acts, as the body in the
projection BQC is moving freely, is equal to

Now the equation between u and z expresses the nature of the curve, and the rotation of
this curve thus has given rise to the proposed surface, and is therefore given.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

885. Therefore this quantity, with the differential of this

Corollary 11. [p. 492]
887. If the direction of the body is first horizontal, the tangent at B is normal to AB and
thus h = f. Now in this case the speed on the surface is equal to the speed in the

projection ; whereby if i is the value of z, and if u = f, then b − gi = c 2 .
f

Corollary 12.

888. If besides the centripetal force at B is equal to the centrifugal force, then the curve
BQC is a circle and therefore so also the curve described on the surface, and both the
motion on the surface as well as that in the projection are equal. Let it be the case, when
u = f and z = i, that dz = mdu ; as p = f and u = f and z = i in the case in which a circle is
described, then 2c3 = gmf 3 . [See (892)]
Corollary 13.
889. If there is put in place π : 1 as the ratio of the periphery to the diameter, then the
perimeter of our circle is equal to 2πf , which divided by the speed
gives the time of one period in the circle, that hence becomes equal to

pendulum completing whole isochronous oscillations with this period is equal to m in
the same hypothesis of gravity.
Corollary 14. [p. 493]

890. Therefore on the surface which is generated by
the rotation of the curve AM (Fig. 96) about the
vertical axis AL, a projected body can describe a circle
of radius LM in the same time that a pendulum of
length equal to the subnormal LS can complete a
whole oscillation.

Corollary 15.

891. Therefore if the curve AM is a parabola, all the
periods along horizontal circles in the parabolic conoid
are completed in equal times; and pendulums in the
same times by performing whole oscillations with a
length equal to half the parameter.

892. Whatever curve AM is assumed, if the centripetal force motion in the projection

Example. [p. 494]

893. Let the surface be a circular cone or AM (Fig.
96 and Fig. 97) a right line inclined at
some angle to the axis AL; whereby then z = mu
and dz = mdu. Therefore the centripetal force
tending towards A which is produced, in order that
the body projected in BQC is moving freely, is
equal to
Therefore this force is composed from a constant
force and from a force that varies inversely as the
cube of the distance from the centre A. If c = 0, then
the projection is a right line passing through A and
the centripetal force is equal to
gm
, or is
1+ m 2
constant. Therefore the body approaches A with a
uniformly accelerated motion; now the motion on
the surface of the cone agrees with the descent or
the ascent on a right line inclined equally and the
acceleration is the same. But if the projection is
curvilinear and the tangent at B is normal to AB,
then

i = mf and b − gmf = c 2 on putting AB = f. Therefore in this case we have

does not depart much from a circle ; but it has various apses, at which the tangent is
perpendicular to the radius. Now the positions of these apses has been determined by
proposition 91 of the preceding book. For since the centripetal force is

apses is equal to 180 m 3+1 degrees. Hence as m 3+1 is always greater than 13 , then the

894. I do not include here the example of the surface of the sphere, but I resolve the
motion on that boundary in the following proposition, since this matter is worthy of being
handled most carefully. For if a pendulum is not set in motion following a vertical plane,
then the body moves on the surface of a sphere and the body describes a circle or another
not less elegant curves, as becomes known from any experiment set up. Indeed the case,
in which a pendulum completes a circle, has now been published in the Acta Erud. Lips.
A. 1715, [p.242] by the most celebrated Johann Bernoulli under the title De centro
turbinationis inventa nova. [Opera omnia, Tom. 2, p. 187]. But if the curve is not
circular, no one as far as I know, has consider either the motion of this pendulum nor
determined it. [Isaac Newton had considered an analogous problem in the Principia,
London, 1687, Book. I sect. X Prop. LV and LVI, in connection with the apses of the
moon, where gravity follows the inverse square law and therefore is not constant; see

895. The rotational [or whirling] motion of a pendulum is the name given to the motion
imparted to a pendulum which is not in a vertical plane. Therefore in this case the
pendulum is not moving in the same vertical plane, but describes some curve on the
surface of the sphere of which the radius is the length of the pendulum in place. [This is
now called the spherical pendulum.]

896. Pendulums are set in motion in rotational motion ; to determine the motion and the
curved line described on the surface of a sphere.
Solution.
Since the moving body is bound by the pendulum, it moves on the surface of a sphere
of which the radius is the length of the pendulum. Let this length or the radius of the
sphere be equal to a ; from the nature of the circle AM (Fig. 96 and Fig. 97) it follows that
z = a − (a 2 − u 2 ) . Hence we have
and thus
From these is found the centripetal force attracting towards A, which put in place, in
order that the body can move freely in the projection BQC , is equal to
And this equation is obtained for the curve BQC :
which is sufficient for the construction of the projection BQC. Let the tangent at B be
perpendicular to the radius AB, which must always happen somewhere, unless the
projection is a straight line, since the centripetal force decreases with decreasing u.
Putting AB = f; then i = a − (a 2 − f 2 ) and [p. 497]

then the body is rotating in a circle, the radius of which is f, with a speed corresponding

distance from the axis, is placed at intervals with the position at which the pendulum is
closest to the axis. Q.E.I.

897. Therefore in order that the pendulum AB = a (Fig. 98) describes the circle BCDE in
g .BO 2
a rotational motion, it is necessary that the speed corresponds to the height 2.AO .

Corollary 2.

898. Now the length of the pendulum, that completes the smallest whole oscillations in
the same time, in which the period is completed in the circle BDCE, is equal to AO.

Corollary 3. [p. 498]

899. Therefore the times, in which different circles are traversed by the rotating
pendulum AB, are in the square root ratio of the heights AO.

Corollary 4.
900. Therefore since the pendulum of length a makes a maximum horizontal circle, the
radius of which is a, an infinitely great speed is required and each period is completed in
an infinitely short time.

Corollary 5.

901. If the radius of the circle BO should be very small with respect to the pendulum
AB = a, the periods of the rotational motion are in agreement with the whole oscillations
of the same pendulum.
Corollary 6.
902. If the curve described by the pendulum should not be a circle, but a close figure and
BO is very small, then the angle between two apses is 900 or a right angle.

Corollary 7.

903. Now in this case the curve described by the body is an ellipse having the centre at
A. Which can be gathered from the centripetal force, which then becomes proportional to
the distances.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 8. [p. 499]
904. Moreover since the larger the radius BO becomes, from that also the greater
becomes the angle intercepted between the two apses. And on making BO = BA, the
angle here is 1800.
Corollary 9.
905. If the angle BAO is 30 degrees, then BO = 12 BA or f = 12 a . Therefore the angle
intercepted between the two apses is 360 degrees or 990 50'. Hence this figure
13
abcdefghik, etc is of the projection in the horizontal plane (Fig. 99), in which the highest
apses are at a, c, e, g, i and the deepest at b, d, f, h, k.
Corollary 10.
906. Therefore in this figure the line of the apses is moving in succession; for each period
progresses by almost 390 in succession.EULER'S MECHANICA VOL. 2.

Corollary 11. [p. 500]
907. But if that angle BAO should be less than 30 degrees, then the progression of the
apses is less also. For whatever the angle BAO which is known at some point, I resolve
the fraction
in a series, which is the following :
Hence in one period the line of the apses is moved forwards by the angle
135 f 2
degrees
a2
as an approximation, if f is very small.
Corollary 12.
908. From these it is apparent that the movement of the line of the apses in individual
periods is almost in the square ratio of the sines of the angle BAO.
