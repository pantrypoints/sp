of the merits of the wave-theory, is omitted.] -->


11. The emission-theory shows the phenomena of shadows, especially when the source of light is merely a point.

But, on the contrary, nothing is more complicated. 

Let us suppose the surface of a body produces the shadow with a repulsive property capable of changing the direction of rays of light passing very near it.

This means that the shadows should increase in size. Towards their edges, these shadows blend a little with the illuminated area.

They are bordered with 3 very distinct colored fringes when one employs white light, and with a still more bright and-dark bands when one uses light which is practically homogeneous. 

These fringes we shall call exterior. 

Those which are observed in the midst of very narrow shadows we shall call interior fringes. 

A Newtonian will explain that the exterior fringes are produced by a force which is alternately attractive and repulsive. 

This force is sourced in the surface of the body producing the shadows. 

The Newtonian theory are not justified by experiment.


12. A magnifying-glass in front of the eye reproduces on the retina any object located at its conjugate focus.

This is the case whenever all the rays which go to make up the object are incident on the surface of the glass.

In place, then, of projecting the fringes upon a white card or a groundglass, one may observe them directly with a magnifyingglass, and he then sees them as they are at its focus.  

One has then only to look towards the luminous point and placethe glass between his eye and the opaque body in such a waythat the point where the refracted rays cross each other fallsin the middle of the pupil.

This position is recognized by thefact that the entire surface of the magnifying-glass appears tobe filled with light. This method is much preferable to theother two in that it enables us to study conveniently phenomena of diffraction in a weak light, and has, at the same time,the further advantage of allowing us to follow the exteriorfringes right up to their source. 

Using a lens of 2 mm. focus and light which is practically homogeneous, I have been able to follow these fringes very close to their origin and yet ob-serve the dark band of the fifth order. 

The interval which sep-arates this band from the edge of the shadow I have measuredon the micrometer and find it to be less than 0.015 mm., whilethe first three fringes are comprised within a space not exceed0.01 mm. ; by using a lens of shorter focus, one would doubtless still further diminish this distance. 

We may thus regardthe dark and bright bands as beginning at the very edge of theopaque body, so long as we do not push the accuracy of ourmeasures beyond the hundredth part of a millimeter an accuracy which proves to be sufficient, and which it is difficult to exceed except when the fringes are somewhat larger, as is thecase with those most frequently observed.


13. We measure the exterior fringes at any given distance from the [opaque] screen and then allow the luminous point to approach ; the fringes are observed to grow much larger. 

Meanwhile the angle whichthe incident ray passing through the origin of the fringes makes with the tangent drawn from the luminous point to the edge ofthe screen will be almost zero.

Since these fringes taketheir rise at a distance less than 0.01 mm. from the edge, the variation of this angle would not be able to sensibly affect thesize of the fringes. 

To explain this enlargement, we must there-fore assume that the repulsive force increases in proportion asthe opaque body approaches the luminous point. 

But this is impossible, for the intensity of this force can evidently dependonly upon the distance at which the light corpuscle passes theopaque body, upon the size and form of the surface of this body, upon its density, mass, or nature ; and by hypothesis these all remain constant.

But even if we suppose the origin of the dark and bright bands to lie at a greater distance from the edge of the screen, a supposition which would explain the fact that they growlarger in proportion as one approaches the luminous point, it is still impossible to make the results of experiment agree withthe formula deduced from the [Newtonian] hypothesis whichwe are here discussing.


14. The following table gives the distance between the darkest point in the dark band of the fourth order and the edge of the geometrical shadow* for different distances of the opaquebody from the luminous point.

These measures have beentaken with a micrometer eye-piece which carries in its focal plane a silk fibre, the whoje being moved by a micrometerscrew. By the aid of a head divided into one hundred parts, passing an index, fixed with reference to the screw, one is able to read the displacement of the silk thread to withinabout 0.01 mm.

Emitting only the red rays and a small portion of the orange rays. One might obtain more homogeneous light by use of a prism,but he would not be so certain as to its identity in the various observations a condition which it is very necessary to satisfy.

15. Let us represent by a and b the respective distances ofthe opaque body from the luminous point and from the micrometer ; let d be the distance from the edge of the body tothe origin of the dark band of the fourth order, and r the tan-gent of the small angle of inflection resulting from the actionof the repulsive forces. 

We then have the following expression for the distance between the edge of the geometrical shadow and the darkest point in the dark band.

Now since `r` and `d`` remain constant whatever be the distancesof the luminous point from the opaque body and from the micrometer respectively, two observations suffice to determinetheir value. Combining the first and the last observations, wefind fl? = 0.5019 mm. and r = 1.8164. 

We thus suppose that at its origin, the dark band of the fourth order is distant 0.5mm from the edge of the opaque body. 

If we substitute these values in the formula andapply it to the intermediate observations, we obtain the follow-ing values, several of which evidently differ widely from theresults of experiment.

No. of Observation


fringes are larger, the measures should be less accurate ; but in repeating them several times I find variations which at mostamount to three or four hundredths of a millimeter. Evensupposing that there were an error of one-half a millimeter in this measure, it would produce only a difference of 0.13 mm.at a distance of 1.003 m. ; so that experiment shows conclusively that the exterior fringes lie on curved lines with their convex side outwards.

The following table gives these trajectories, referred to their chords, for different series of observations, in each of whichthe distance of the opaque body from the luminous point remains constant. 

In the fourth series I suppose first that thechord joins the two extreme readings, and next I suppose it to be drawn from the edge of the opaque body itself where thedeviation of the fringes from their origin is, as we have alreadyseen, very small. In the other series the chord joins the edgeof the opaque body and the point most distant from it.

of light produce upon one another. Recently the distinguished Dr. Thomas Young has shown by a simple and ingeniousexperiment that the interior fringes are produced by the meeting of rays inflected at each side of the opaque body. Thishe proved by using a screen to intercept one of the two pencils of light; and in this way lie was able to make the interiorfringes completely vanish, whatever might be the form, mass,or nature of the screen, and whether he intercepted the lu-minous pencil before or after its passage into the shadow.

18. Brighter and sharper fringes may be produced by cut-ting two parallel slits close together in a piece of cardboardor a sheet of metal, and placing the screen thus prepared infront of the luminous point. We may then observe, by useof a magnifying -glass between the opaque body and the eye,that the shadow is filled with a large number of very sharpcolored fringes so long as the light shines through both openings at the same time, but these disappear whenever the lightis cut off from one of the slits. 

19. If we allow two pencils of light, each coming from thesame source and regularly reflected by two metallic mirrors,to meet under a very small angle, we obtain similar fringes,the colors of which are even purer and more brilliant thanbefore. 

To obtain these bands, it is necessary to be very careful that in the region where the two mirrors come into contact, or at least throughout a portion of their line of contact,,the surface of the one is not shifted sensibly past that of theother. This is necessary in order that the difference of pathtraversed by two reflected rays meeting in the area commonto the two luminous* fields may be very small.

The theory of interference alone will* In the case of white light, or even in light as homogeneous as possible, the number of fringes which one can see is always limited, because evenwhen the light has reached a degree of simplicity as great as possiblewithout too far diminishing its intensity, it is still composed of rays which are heterogeneous; and since the bright and dark bands thus produced donot all have the same size, they encroach the one upon the other in pro-portion as their order increases, and finally they completely destroy eachother ; and this is why one does not see any fringes when the differenceof paths becomes slightly sensible. Concerning the details of this ex-periment and its explanation on the principle of interference, see the article upon Light in the French translation of Thomson's Chemistry, already cited.


explain this experiment, and that the experiment calls formanipulation so delicate and effort so continued that it is almost impossible that one should strike upon it by accident.
If we raise one of the mirrors or intercept the light which it reflects either before or after reflection, the fringes disappearas in the preceding case. This furnishes still further evidencethat the fringes are produced, not by the action of the edgesof the mirrors, but by the meeting of two pencils of light.For these fringes are always at right angles to the line whichjoins the two images of the luminous point, whatever be its inclination with respect to these edges, at least throughout theextent of the area which is common to the two regularly re-flected pencils.*

20. Since the fringes which one sees in the interior ofthe shadow of a very narrow body and those which one obtains by the use of two mirrors result evidently from the mutual influence of rays of light, analogy would indicate that thesame thing ought to be true for the exterior fringes of theshadows of bodies illuminated by a point source.

The first explanation which occurs to one is that these fringes are pro-duced by the interference of direct rays with those which arereflected at the edge of the opaque body, while the interiorfringes result from the combined action of rays inflected intothe shadow from the two sides of the opaque body, these in-flected rays having their origin either at the surface or atpoints indefinitely near it. This appears to be the opinion ofMr. Young, and it was at first my o\vn opinion ; but a closerexamination of the phenomena convinced me of its falsity.

Nevertheless, I propose to follow it to its logical conclusionand to state the formula which I have derived in order to facilitate comparison of this theory with that which I offer as asubstitute. Let R, Fig. 14, be the radiant point, AA' the opaque body, andFT' either a white screen upon which the shadow of this bodyfalls or the focal plane of a magnifying-glass with which the* When the fringes extend outside, all their exterior portions resulting from the meeting of rays regularly reflected by one of the mirrors and raysinflected near the edge of the other should have different directions. If one observes this phenomenon carefully, he will see that the form andposition of the fringes are in each case in accord with the theory of interference.

fringes are observed. RT and RT' are rays tangent at theedge of the opaque body, T and T' being the limits of the ge-ometrical shadow. Let us indicate bya the distance RB from the luminouspoint to the opaque body, by b the dis-tance BO of the body from the whitescreen, and by c its diameter, AA',which we shall consider very small compared with the distances a and b. Thisassumption is made in order that wemay measure the size of the fringeseither in a plane perpendicular to RTor perpendicular to the line RC,which passes through the middle of theshadow.

With these conventions we shall consider, first, the exterior fringes. Let F be any point on the re-ceiving screen outside the shadow. The difference of pathtraversed by the direct ray, and by the ray reflected at the edgeof the opaque body, and meeting the direct ray at this point,is RA+ AF RF. Let us represent FT by x, and express inseries the values of RF, AR, and AF. Then, if we neglect all terms involving any power of x or of c higher than the second,since they are very small compared with distances a and b, theterms which contain c will disappear and we shall have for thedifference of path traversed
