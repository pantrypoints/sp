21. Let `X` be the length of a light-wave which is the distance between 2 points in the ether.

Within this length are the same kind of vibrations happening at the same time. 

Then A/2 will be the distance between 2 ether particles whose velocities of vibration are at any one instant equal but oppositely directed. 

Thus 2 trains of waves separated by an interval equal to X are in perfect accord as to their vibrations.

But when the distance between corresponding pointsis A/2, then their vibrations are directly opposed.

Accordingly, the above formula gives for the value of `x`, corresponding to the centre of the dark band of the first order, the followingvalue :

Observation shows that this is the brightest part of the first fringe.

On the same theory, the edge of the geometrical shadow, where the difference of path vanishes, should be brighter than the rest of the fringe, while this is precisely the darkest region outside the geometrical shadow. 

In general, the position of the dark and bright bands deduced from this formula is almost exactly the inverse of that determined by experiment.

This is the first difficulty presented by this theory.

To avoid it, we must suppose that the rays reflected at the edge of the screen suffer the loss of half a wave-length. 

We add A/2 to the difference of path, `d`, the general expression becomes

...

Replacing d in this formula by A/2, 3 A/2, 5 A/2, 7 A/2, etc., wehave for the values of x corresponding to dark bands of thefirst, second, third, fourth, etc., orders:

/2\b(a + d) /\b(a + b) /Q\b(a+b) . v
- ^r v <r~ V~ ^T-> V~ ^--> etc- 

These formulae agree well with the observations.

However, closer measurements show that the ratios between thesizes of the fringes derived from these expressions are not exactly correct, as we shall see later.

22. I pass now to the consideration of interior fringes produced in the shadow by the meeting of two pencils of light inflected at A and A'.

Let M, Fig. 14, be any point located in the interior of the shadow ; the intensity of the light at this point depends upon the amount of disagreement between thevibrations of the rays AM and A'M, which meet at this point, or upon the difference of path A'M AM. 

I shall denote by xthe distance MC of the point M from the middle of the shadow,and by d the difference of paths, and hence

Expanding the radicals and neglecting the higher powers of
x, since this quantity is very small compared with b, we have
dcxjb,

or x = bd/c. If in place of d in this expression we substitute successively X/2,3X/2, 5X/2, 7X/2, etc., we obtain the values of x corresponding to dark bands of the first, second, third, fourth, etc.,order, namely, b\ 3X 5b\ 7#X , 7\~> ~T ' ~T > ~z\ > etc., 2c 2c 2c 2c and consequently for the distance between the middle points oftwo consecutive dark bands, b\/c.

The general expression for n such intervals is, therefore,rib\lc. 

23. So long as the extreme fringes are sufficiently distantfrom the edges of the shadow, this formula agrees fairly well with experiment. 

But when they approach very near or passbeyond the edges, one detects a slight difference between their actual position and that deduced from the formula. 

In general, the calculated values are always a little larger than the observed.

I will explain this in the true theory of diffraction.

Also, the size of the interior fringes should be entirely independent of the distance, a, of the luminous point fromthe opaque body.

This prediction, however, is not completely verified by experiment, especially when the fringes completelyfill the shadow; their position then varies distinctly with thedistance a. 

24. According to the formula which we have just derived for the exterior fringes, their position depends upon a as well as upon b. 

Experiment showsthat, in fact, their size increases or diminishes according as theopaque body approaches or recedes from the luminous point,and that the ratios between the different sizes of one and thesame fringe deduced from the formula are precisely those givenby observation. But the most remarkable inference from thisformula is that, when a remains constant, the distance of anydark or bright band from the edge of the geometrical shadowis not directly proportional to b as in the case of interiorfringes, but varies in such a way that this band traces out, nota straight line, but a hyperbola of sensible curvature. 

This is also confirmed by experiment, as may be seen from the observations given above. Considering the striking agreement of these formulae withexperiment, it is natural to suppose that they are accurate ex-pressions of fact, and therefore natural to attribute any smalldifferences between calculated and observed values to the errorswhich are unavoidable in such delicate measurements.*

But a closer examination of the hypotheses from which theyare derived, and of the inferences derivable from them,  showsthat they do not agree with the facts of nature.

25. If the fringes at the edge of a shadow are really due tothe meeting of the direct rays with those reflected at the edgeof the screen, their intensity ought to depend upon the areaand the curvature of its surface, and the fringes produced bythe back of a razor, for instance, ought to be much more vis-
* It might appear at first sight that one would be able to adapt this theory to the ideas of Newton by introducing the principle of interference, as I have indicated above ; but besides the complication of fundamentalhypotheses and the small probability of any of them, this principle, it ap- pears to me, would lead to consequences which contradict the emissiontheory. M. Arago has remarked that the interposition of a thin transparent plate
at the edge of an opaque body sufficiently narrow to produce interior fringes in its shadow displaces these fringes and shifts them towards the side [see paper by Arago (Ann. Chim. et Phys.,\., p. 199, 1816)] where is placed the transparent plate. This being so, it follows from the principle of interference that the rays which have traversed the plate have been re- tarded in their path, because the same fringes in each case must correspondto equal intervals between the times of arrival of rays. This inference at once confirms the wave-theory and manifestly contradicts the emissiontheory, in which one is compelled to assume that light travels more rapidlyin dense than in rare media. This objection can be avoided only by substituting for difference of path difference of "fit"; but we lose all that was gained by the principle of interference in thus replacing a sharp idea by a hazy one, a satisfactory
explanation by one which does not aid our understanding of the phenomena ; for one can readily see how two light particles striking the retina at the same point may produce sensations more or less intense, according as the
interval of time which separates two consecutive impacts is sufficient to produce unison or dissonance between the vibrations at the optic nerve;while it is by no means so easy to see how this effect could be producedby a difference of "
fit " between two light particles, or how by simultaneousimpact on the optic nerve they would produce no effect at all when they were in opposite "
fits," even though their mechanical impacts were in perfect unison.

ible than those produced by the edge; but, using a magnifyingglass at a distance of some centimeters, one detects practically no difference in intensity in these two cases. This testis more easily made by using a steel plate one edge of whichis round throughout a part of its length and sharp through-out the remainder of its length, these two edges lying inthe same straight line. One is thus easily convinced thatthe fringes have the same intensity throughout their entirelength.

26. We know that under large angles of incidence dull sur-faces reflect light almost as well as polished mirrors. This is easily explained either on the emission-theory or on the wavetheory. But although one can understand how difference ofpolish cuts a small figure when the angle of incidence is large,it is not easy to see how the intensity of the reflected light canbe independent of the curvature of the reflecting surface; indeed, it is clear that as the radius of curvature diminishesthe reflected rays will diverge more and more, whatever- betheir angle of incidence.

27. Not only so, but I have convinced myself by anothersimple experiment of the incorrectness of the hypothesis whichI had first adopted, and which I am now opposing. I cut asheet of copper into the shape represented in Fig. 15, andplaced it in a dark room about four meters in front of aluminous point, and examined its shadow with a magnifyingglass. What I observed, on slowly re-ceding, was as follows: When the largefringes produced by each of the verynarrow openings CEE'C' and DFF'D'had spread out into the geometricalshadow of CDFE, which received practically only white light from each sep-arate slit, the interior fringes producedby the meeting of these two pencils oflight showed colors much sharper andFig i 5. purer than the interior fringes of the shadow of ABDO, andwere, at the same time, much brighter. On receding still farther, I noticed that the light diminished throughout thewhole of the shadow of ABFE, but much more rapidly backof EFDC than in the upper part of the shadow, so that therewas one particular instant when the intensity of the light appeared to be the same above and below, after which the fringes
remained less intense in the lower* part, although their colors were always much purer.


If, now, the only inflected light were that which grazed the edges of the opaque bodies, the fringes of the upper part oughtto be sharper and ought to show purer colors than those of the lower part ; for* the first are produced by the meeting of two systems of waves which have their centres upon the edges
AC and BD, while the others are formed by the meeting of four systems of waves having their origin at the edges C'E',
CE, DF, DF'; and this would necessarily diminish the differ- ence of intensity between the dark and bright bands, in the case of homogeneous light, or the purity of the colors, in the
case of white light, because the fringes produced by the rays
reflected and inflected at C'E' and DF would not exactly coincide with those produced by the meeting of rays coming fromCE and D'F'. Now experiment shows, as I have just said, that
exactly the reverse of this is true. One might explain on this same hypothesis how it happens that the shadow of ECDFis much brighter than that of ABDC arising from the double
source of light presented by the two edges of each slit ; but fromthis it would follow that the lower part ought always to be brighter, and we have just seen that this is not the fact. 28. From the experiments which I have just described it is evident that we cannot attribute the phenomena of diffraction
solely to rays which graze the edge of the body ; but we must, on the contrary, admit that there is an infinitude of other rays sensibly distant from the body and yet deviated from their
original direction, so as to meet and form these fringes.

29. The spreading out of a pencil of light in passing through a very narrow opening shows in an even better manner that the inflection of light occurs at a sensible distance from the edges* 

In order that this difference of intensity between the two parts of the shadow shall be as marked as possible, it is necessary that the slits CE aud DF be very narrow as compared with the distance which separates them, and that the sheet of copper should be as far away as possible from the luminous point. [In repeating this experiment, it will be found very convenient to use, in- stead of sheet copper, an unfieed photographic plate : lantern slide is best. The two slits can be cut either with a pocket-knife or, better still, by means of a
dividing engine.] 95


of the diaphragm. It was in the consideration of this phenomenon that I discovered the error into which I had previouslyfallen. When one brings the edges of two opaque screens veryclose together in front of a luminous point in a dark room, heobserves that the region illuminated by the aperture greatly in-creases. Such screens were Newton's two knife-edges. I shallsuppose, as in his- experiment, that the edges of the apertureare thin and perfectly sharp ; not that this has any effect uponthe phenomena, but simply for making clearer the conclusionwhich is to be drawn. The small number of rays which grazethese sharp edges, being spread out over a rather large area,could produce only an insensible amount of illumination, or, atmost, an exceedingly feeble light, and in the midst of it oneought to see a bright band traced out by the pencil of directrays. This, however, is not the fact ; for white light of almostuniform intensity fills a space much larger than the projectionof the aperture,* and gradually grows weaker, shading into thedark bands of the first order. It was doubtless in order to ac-count for the large amount of light inflected that Newton supposed the action of the body upon rays of light to extend tosensible distances, but this hypothesis will not bear carefulscrutiny.

30. If the expansion of a pencil of light which passes througha narrow opening were brought about by attractive and repulsive forces having their origin at the edges of the aperture, theintensity of these forces, and consequently their effect uponthe light, would necessarily vary with the nature, the mass, andthe surface of the edges of the screen. All forces produced bya body acting at a sensible distance and taking their rise in anyconsiderable extent of its mass or its surface would dependupon the relative positions and upon the number of particlescontained within this sphere of activity, or, what is the samething, upon the shape of the surface. If, then, the phenomenain question are due to the action of such forces, one would ex-pect that, on placing a sharp body opposite a round body, therays of light would be inflected more to the one side than the* The illuminated space increases so rapidly in comparison with the width. of the conical projection of the aperture as the receiving screen recedes fromthe aperture, and likewise when the aperture itself is further withdrawnfrom the luminous point, that by making these two distances sufficiently great one can obtain the same effect with an opening of any size. 96

other ; but, as I have shown by a very simple experiment, this
is not the fact. I passed a pencil of rays between two steel plates whose vertical edges were brought very close togetherand were carefully straightened throughout their entire length.
A part of each edge was sharp, the rest of it round, and these edges were arranged so that the round portion of one plate cor- responded to the sharp one of the other. Thus, if a sharp edgewere located on the right in the upper part of the opening, an- other was located on the left in the lower part, so that if there
had been any difference in the action of the two edges upon the
rays, I should have noticed it in the relative positions of theupper and lower parts of the bright interval at the middle, andespecially in the fringes in that neighborhood, as they would be
interrupted at the point of passage from the sharp to the roundedge ;. but, on observing them closely, I noted that they wereperfectly straight throughout their entire length, even at the
bright interval in the middle, exactly in the same way as whentwo edges of the same kind are opposed one to the other. Theexperiment may be varied by using plates made of two different substances, but the result* obtained will certainly remain the same.
31. All the experiments which I have tried so far haveshown that the nature of the body interposed has in otherrespects no more influence upon the inflection of light than is exerted by the mass or the shape of the two edges. I shall
cite only one experiment, in which I have taken every precaution necessary to determine the correctness of this principle,
which, indeed, is already well established by the precedingexperiment.
I covered an unsilvered mirror with a layer of India inkspread over a thin layer of paper, forming together a thicknessof one-tenth of a millimeter. With a sharp point I traced twoparallel lines, and then carefully removed from between these two lines the paper and the India ink which adhered to the
surface of the glass. This aperture, as measured by the microm-* Messrs. Berthollet and Mains found a long while ago that the nature
of the body had no effect upon the diffraction of light. For screens they
employed plates composed of different substances, with edges made up,
for instance, of very dense metal and a piece of ivory ; but they had no means of observation so convenient and accurate iis mine, and consequently one might suspect that some small difference might have escaped them. G 97

eter, was 1.17 mm. I then placed opposite each other twocopper cylinders, each having a diameter of 14.5 mm., and bymeans of a graduated wedge I made the interval between thesecylinders also 1.1? mm. The cylinders, placed alongside theblackened glass, were at a distance of 4.015 m. from the lumi-nous point, and at a distance of 1.663 m. from the micrometer.I then measured the size of the fringes produced by these twoopenings, and found that they were absolutely the same. Thefollowing are the results of the two observations made withwhite light : The distance between the darkest point ~\ mm.of the two dark bands of the first I First reading, 1.49order at the point of separation of [Second reading,

It is hardly possible that two sets of circumstances shoulddiffer more than these as regards the mass and the nature ofthe edges of the aperture. In the one case there is a singlelayer of India ink producing the fringes, for the glass to whichit adheres completely fills the aperture ; in the other case wehave two massive cylinders of copper, 14.5 mm. in diameter,giving us an aperture whose edges have very considerablemasses and areas, but we observe 110 difference in the expansion of the pencil of light. 

32. It is therefore certain that the phenomena of diffractiondo not at all depend upon the nature, the mass, or the shape ofthe body which intercepts the light,* but only upon the size ofthe intercepting body or upon the size of the aperture throughwhich it passes. We must, therefore, reject any hypothesiswhich assigns these phenomena to attractive and repulsive* This is so, at least provided one does not consider the shadow too closeup to the edge of the screen, or provided the surface grazed by the rays oflight has not too large an area compared with this distance ; for in thiscase it may happen that the reflected rays sensibly affect the phenomenonas, for instance, occurs when the surface grazed by the rays is a planemirror of one or two decimeters in size and when one observes the fringesat a short distance. 

Besides, there would then be successive diffractionsover an area too considerable for one to neglect.

forces whose action extends to a distance from the body as great as that at which rays are inflected. We are equallyunable to admit that diffraction is caused by a shallow atmosphere which has the same thickness as the sphere of activity of these forces, and whose refractive index differs from that ofthe neighboring medium ; for this second hypothesis, like thefirst, would lead us.'to think that the inflection of light oughtto vary with the form and the nature of the edge of the screen, and ought not to be the same, for instance, at the edge and at the back of a razor. Now, on the emission-theory it is impossible to explain in any other manner the expansion of a beam of light passing through a narrow opening, and this expansion is a well-established fact.* Consequently, the phenomena of dif- fraction cannot be explained on the emission-theory.
