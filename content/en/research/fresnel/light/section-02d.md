57. Let the waves from any luminous point be partly intercepted by an opaque body `AG`.

This screen is so large that no light comes around the edge `G`.

We need consider only that part of the wavewhich lies to the left of the point `A`. 

Let `DB` represent the plane on which are received the shadow and its fringes.

The problem then is to find the intensity of the light at any point `P` in this plane.

The circle `AMI` has center `C` with a radius `CA`.

It represents the light-wave when it is partly intercepted by the opaque body.

It is from this position of the wave that I have computed the resultant of the sec- ondary waves sent to the point P.. 

If we consider the wave in an earlier position, say A'MT, i.t then becomes necessary to calculate the effect of the obstacle on each of the secondary waves arising from the arc A'MT

If we consider the wave in a later position, say `A"M"I"`, it becomes necessary to first determine the intensities of its various points, for they are no longer equal, having been changed by the inter- position of the screen. 

In this case the computation is vastly more complicated, possibly quite impracticable. 

If, however, we consider the wave at the instant it Fig. 19 reaches A, the process is simple ; for then all parts of the wavehave the same intensity.

Not only so, but none of the secondary waves are now affected by the opaque screen. Howevernumerous the subdivisions into which we may consider theseelementary waves divided, it is evident that the number will be the same for each, since they are transmitted freely in all directions. And, therefore, we need only consider the axes of these pencils of split rays?, e., the straight lines drawn fromthe various points on the wave AMI to the point P. The dif- ferences of length in these direct rays are the differences of path traversed by the elementary or partial resultants meetingat P.*

In order to compute the total effect, I refer these partial re- sultants to the wave emitted by the point M on the straight line CP, and to another wave displaced a quarter of a wave-lengthwith reference to the preceding problem. We shall consider only a section of the wave madeby a plane perpendicular to the edge of the screen, and shallindicate by dz an element, nn', of the primary wave, and by z its distance from the point M. 

<!-- This is the process already employed (p. 101) in the general solution of the interference. -->


These, as I have shown, suffice todetermine the position and the relative intensities of the brightand dark bands. The distance nS included between the waveAMI and the tangential arc, EMF, described about the point Pas centre is

...

where. a and b are, as before, the distances 

...
<!-- ab

If we denote the wave-length by X, we have forthe component in question, referred to the wave leaving thepoint M, the following expression

<!-- dz cos ( TT -
) ; \ abX J
'  -->

while for the other component,* referred to a wave displaced aquarter of a wave-length from the first, we have If, now, we take the sum of all similar components of all theother elements, we shall have:

<!--  rdz cos , +
and rdz siri J ab\ I J ab\ -->

Hence the intensity of the vibration at P resulting from all these small disturbances is

...

The intensity of the sensation, being proportional to the square of the speeds of the particles, is

...

This is what I have called the intensity of the light, while reserving the expression intensity of vibration to designate the speed of an ether particle during its oscillation. *

<!-- [ TJiese expressions for amplitude follow directly from sec. 40, when in the
ke a. 120
general expressionfor velocity we make ao, a'=dz, and c=^- .] -->


58. In the case we are now considering, where the body, AG,is so large that we can neglect any light coming around theedge G, the integration extends from A to infinity on the sidetowards I. This integral naturally divides into two parts, oneextending from A to M, the other from M to infinity. Thislatter integral remains constant, while the former varies withthe position of the point P. This variation, indeed, is the de-termining factor in the size and relative intensity of the brightand dark bands. 

The integrals

dz sin may be evaluated in finite terms when the limits of z are takenat zero and infinity ; but between any other limits their valuescan be expressed only in terms of a series or by means of partial integration.


The latter method seems to me more convenient, and I have,therefore, employed it in the computation of the followingtable, where the limits of integration are taken so close togetherthat we can neglect the square of half the arc included betweenthem.*

This arc here amounts to ^ of a quadrant, since this fur- nishes results of an accuracy greater than is attainable in the observations.

In place of the integrals mentioned above, I havesubstituted fdv sin qv"

/v To pass from one of these forms to the other is a simplematter.

[Following is a derivation of these formulae, which Verdet found in one of Fresnel's journals. Let the limits of integration he denoted by a and a -f 2p. Put v=a+p-\-u. Then du=dv ; and when v=a, u=p; but whenv=a+2p, u=+p.

Either of the integrals idv cos qv* and jdv sin qv* taken from zero to infinity have the value -3-. We may thus by the aid of the above table find the intensity of light corresponding to any given position of the point P, or, what is the samething, corresponding to any definite value of v, where v is one limit of integration and infinity the other.

We have only to take from the table the values of

<!-- J

using the value of v as an argument, then add to each , andfinally take the sum of their squares.


59. Simple inspection of this table shows a periodic changein the intensity of light as one leaves the geometrical shadow.

To obtain the values of v corresponding to maxima and minima,i. e., the brightest and darkest points in the respective bright and dark bands, I take from the table the numbers which mostnearly correspond to them and then compute the corresponding intensities. Finally, by means of these data and a simple
formula of approximation, I determine with sufficient accu- racy the values of v. which give maxima and minima.

Let us represent by * the approximate value of v taken di- rectly from the table, by / and Y the corresponding values of _[_ jdv cos qv* and i+jdv sin qv*, and by t the small arc by which v must be increased in order to give the maximum or minimum of light. 

Neglecting the square of t, we find that the following formula gives the value of t which yields a maximum or a minimum.

If in this formula we substitute the numbers taken from the
table, we obtain the following results :
either integral. The successive values of v employed in the first column
are 6=0.1,
0=0.2,
v=0.3,
etc. The same remark applies to the following tables. [E. Verdet.] 124

or, substituting for z,

This radical, it may be remarked, is exactly the distancebetween the edge of the geometrical shadow and that point which corresponds to a difference* of a quarter of a wave-lengthbetween the direct ray and the ray coming via the edge of theopaque screen. But this is precisely what might have beenpredicted, inasmuch as the corresponding value of v [viz., the quadrant] has been taken as unity in the table of numericalvalues of 

<!-- jdv cos qv

If in the formula

...
<!-- V 2a~ -->


we substitute for n the value corresponding to a minimum of the first order i. e., to the darkest part of the first dark band,we have

z = 1.873


61. If, however, we assume that the fringes are producedby the meeting of the direct rays with those reflected at theedge of the opaque screen, and if we suppose further that thereflected rays lose half a wave-length, we have [section 20] for the same band or x=

Accordingly, these two quantities are in the ratio of 2 to 1.873. The second is measurably smaller than the first, differing as they do by nearly a fifteenth; so that by accurate observations on homogeneous light of well-determined wave-length onemight distinguish between these two theories by means of experiment.


62. The method which I at first thought best adapted to the determination of the wave-length was to measure the size of the fringes produced by two mirrors slightly inclined to oneanother, and also the distance between the two images of theluminous point; but the slightest curvature in the mirrorsdiminishes the accuracy, and so I preferred to use the bands* [The general expression for this difference of path, d, has been given
above section 20. ax* ~2b(a+b)' Put d=, and we haw the value of x in question.] 127


produced by a narrow slit combined with the cylindrical lensof which I have already spoken. We have already found thatthe distance between any two consecutive dark bands, either tothe right or the left of the aperture, is , where X is the wavec length, c the width of the aperture, and b its distance from themicrometer. The distance between the two dark bandsofthe first order is just twice this amount. With these data, itis an easy matter to determine X from measurements on thefringes.

The following table gives the results of five observations ofthis kind, together with the wave-lengths computed from them.In order to describe all the conditions of the experiment,Iinclude in the table the various values of #, the distance fromthe luminous point to the screen, even though this quantityisnot employed in the  calculation. 

These measures have beenmade with practically homogeneous red light, obtained by useof the same colored glass which, for the purpose of gettingresults that are comparable, I have used in all my observations. Each measure recorded in the table is the mean of fourobservations.


65. Having thus, by means of simple and well-known methods, verified the wave-length determination made with the
single slit and cylindrical lens, I have used this same value to compute the exterior fringes by use of the formula

<!-- S = IH>+*)*X
, 2a -->

substituting for w those values of v which, according to the
table, give maxima and minima.

The table on page 130 summarizes the results of calculation
and observation. In my experiments I have measured the
positions of the minima only, because I considered this a sufficient test of the theory, and because my eye can determine the darkest point of a dark band with greater accuracy than it canset upon the brightest point of a bright baud.

[Only every fifth observation in the table is reproduced.]

More striking agreement between theory and experimentcould scarcely be expected. W^hen these small differences are compared with the quantities measured, and when the great variations in the quantities a and b are noted, one can no longer doubt that the integrals which led to these Jesuits accurately describe the law governing the phenomena. 

The probability in favor of the new theory is still further increased by the fact that the wave-length here employed has been deduced fromdifferent and simpler phenomena.

[Four pages, devoted to a description of some experimental precautions and to a computation of exterior fringes on Young'shypothesis of reflection from the edge of the opaque body, are here omitted.}

68. Both the formation and the position of the exterior fringes can be explained in a satisfactory manner by considering them as produced by the meeting of aninfinitely great number of secondary waves which originate onthat part of the primary wave which is not intercepted by the opaque screen.

From this view it follows that the light whichis inflected into the shadow ought not to produce any bright or dark band, but ought to diminish gradually in intensity, provided the screen is sufficiently large to allow no light to goaround the other side; and this is true, even though this inflected light, like that which gives rise to the exterior fringes, is the resultant of an infinitude of secondary waves. This will

by taking the sums of the squares of the corresponding numbersand subtracting ^. In spite of the inaccuracy introduced by the method of partial integration employed in the first table, it is seen that the intensity of light diminishes rapidly as v increases, presenting none of the maxima and minima observed outside of the shadow.


### Intensities Of Light Diffracted Into The Shadow Under Different Angles

Values of v 

and therefore


69. By the aid of these formulae we can find the value of thedistance x or the angle x/b of the inflected ray correspondingto the various values of #; and vice versa, if x or the slant x/bbe given, we can find v, and thus determine the intensity of theinflected light. One striking inference from this formula,\ a, is that the values of x are not directly pro6(1 portional to those of b, but are related to them as the ordinatesof a hyperbola are to its abscissas. It thus follows that pointsof equal intensity along the edge of the geometrical shadow donot lie upon a straight line as we vary b, but upon a hyperbolaof appreciable curvature, like the corresponding loci in exteriorfringes.

70. I have not yet succeeded in verifying by direct experiment the ratios of intensity in the inflected light as predictedby the theory of interference applied to the principle of Huygens. 

A measurement of this kind is very difficult [foot-noteomitted], and I hardly think that one would be able to reachthe same accuracy as in the determination of the darkest andbrightest points in fringes. The results already obtained forfringes, however, appear to me as verifications indirect, itmust be confessed of these very ratios of intensity; forwhenever the positions of maxima and minima have been de-duced from the general expression for the intensity of lightand have been found to coincide accurately with experiment,it becomes more and more probable that this integral correctly represents all the variations of intensity in the inflectedlight.

71. In the case of exterior fringes one may, as we have seen,use the table of maxima and minima to compute the positionsof the darkest and brightest points in the dark and bright bandsfor all values of a and b. This, however, is not the case withregard to the interior fringes in the shadow of a narrow bodyor in the case of a narrow aperture. 

The limits of the integralvary all the while, and it is therefore impossible to give generalresults applicable to every case, so that one is obliged to deter-mine the maxima and minima for each particular case, using the table, which gives the numerical values of j

<!-- dv cos qv
2 and/ dv sin qv

.  -->

I propose to give the results of all the computations of this kind which, up to the present, I have made for the purpose of testing the theory. They are very long, and I havenot been able to finish as many as I had desired, but this lack in quantity is, perhaps, compensated by the variety of the cases which I have studied, for in trying the theory on the observations, I have, by preference, selected cases in which the disposi- tion of the fringes is somewhat unusual.

72. first, I propose to consider the case of a narrowaperture which presents at once the
case of exterior and interior fringes.

Let C be a luminous point, AG a narrow aperture whose edges A and G are straight and parallel ; let BD be the central projection of this aperture upon the plane in which the fringes are observed,
and P be any point in this plane
at which the intensity is to be determined.

For this purpose we must integrate 

<!-- // g* dz cos ( 2q
and
''(ab]\
ab\ I
I dz sin l*2q ab\ 1  -->

between the limits A and G, afterwards taking the sum of thesquares of these integrals. 


This will give us the intensity of light at the point P, but we must not forget that the origin
from which z is measured lies upon the direct line CP, andthat therefore the two limits A and G correspond to z=MGand z= AM. The next step is to compute the correspondingvalues of v from the formula
/2 v=zyor


where x is the distance from the point P to the edge of thegeometrical shadow. From the table of integrals,

<!-- / dv cos qv
2 and / dv sin qv
2
,  -->

we then find the values most nearly corresponding to those of v. Let us call t the difference between the value for which theintegral is desired and the. number i [for which it is computed]in the table. The proper integral can then be found by meansof the formulas of approximation.

Having made this computation for the two values of v whichrepresent the edges A and G- of the aperture, if the point is in-side we add these integrals; if, however, it is on the outside,we subtract them ; and, lastly, take the sum of the squares ofthe two numbers thus found. In like manner, one finds theintensity of the light for any other point whose position is given, and in comparing these various results the positions ofmaxima and minima may be found.
[Half a page concerning the method of interpolation is hereomitted.]


73. In order to apply this method of computation to the ob-servations, I first determined the tabulary value of c, that is tosay, the size of the aperture, by means of the formula
f, = /2(a V

so that I thus obtained the tabular interval between the limits.By a few easy trials I find between what numbers of the tablethe maxima and minima lie ; afterwards I determine their posi-tion more accurately by the process which I have just described. Having thus obtained the values of v corresponding tomaxima or minima, I subtract them from the half of the tabularyvalue of c, in order to refer them to the middle of the aperture.And, last of all, the for inn hi 2a
gives me the distance of these same maxima or minima fromthe middle of the projection of aperture, which is the point ofreference used in my observations.
