Erasistratus writes about nutrition in book 2 of his “General Principles.”

 <!-- fails to escape this same difficulty.  -->

He believes that matter tends to fill a vacuum. But he only believed it for the veins and their contained blood.211 

When blood is running through the veins, an absolutely empty space cannot result.

<!-- (for this was what he overlooked) -->
The veins cannot collapse because the adjoining quantum of fluid flows in and fills the place of the fluid evacuated. 

The veins are nourished this way.
- They get the benefit of the blood which they contain. 

<!-- But how about the nerves?212  -->

The nerves do not contain blood.

He says that a nerve has within itself veins and arteries, like a rope woven by Nature out of 3 different strands. 

If the nerve contains within itself a blood-vessel, it will no longer need the adventitious flow of other blood from the real adjacent vein.

This fictitious vessel, perceptible only in theory, will suffice it for nourishment.

This small vessel will nourish itself. 

But it will not be able to nourish this adjacent simple nerve or artery, unless these have some innate proclivity for attracting nutriment. 

How could the simple nerve attract its nourishment like the composite veins?

 <!-- by virtue of the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled? -->

According to Erasistratus, a nerve has a cavity that is not occupied with blood, but with psychic pneuma 

<!-- 215 -->

The nutriment is introduced, not into this cavity, but into the nerve-vessel containing it. This creates nourishment and growthh. 

<!-- How then is it introduced? -->

This simple nerve is so small.

<!-- —as are also the other two—that  -->

If you prick it at any part with the finest needle you will tear the whole three of them at once.

It cannot have empty space inside it. 

<!-- Thus there could never be in it a perceptible space entirely empty. -->

And an emptied space which merely existed in theory could not compel the adjacent fluid to come and fill it.

Is this small elementary nerve one and continuous? 

Or does it consist of many small bodies, such as those assumed by Epicurus, Leucippus, and Democritus?

<!-- 216  -->

The Erasistrateans are at variance on this subject.

1. Some think that it is one and continuous since it is simple.

In this case, what is evacuated from it in the so-called insensible transpiration of the physicians will leave no empty space in it.

Otherwise it would not be one body but many, separated by empty spaces.

2. Some think that it is made up of yet other elementary bodies.*

{{< n n="They are both correct" >}}

In this case, we have “escaped by the back door” according to Asclepiades. This is because this postulates inharmonious elements.

This makes Nature “inartistic”.

<!-- ; for this necessarily follows the assumption of such elements. -->

This is why I think that some of the Erasistrateans have very foolishly reduced the simple vessels to elements such as these.

Yet it does not matter because Erasistratus's theory of nutrition is absurd.

They believe that the large perceptible nerves are made up of these minute simple vessels.

But it is impossible for any “refilling of a vacuum” if the nerves are simple and continuous.
- This is because no vacuum can occur in a continuum even if anything does run away.*

{{< n n="Galen is unable to understand that immaterial energy can create nourishment" >}}

This is because the parts left come together (as is seen in the case of water) and again become one, taking up the whole space of that which previously separated them. 


“Refilling” is also impossible if the nerves are made up of small bodies since none of their elements need it. 

This is because the refilling principle only holds for perceptible things, and not for theoretical ones.  

Erasistratus acknowledges this.

He says that his nerves are not such a vacuum interspersed in small portions among the corpuscles.

Instead, this vacuum is clear, perceptible, complete in itself, large in size, and evident.

He writes: “there cannot be a perceptible space which is entirely empty”

<!-- or however else one cares to term it (for, what Erasistratus himself says is, that 
 while I, for my part, being abundantly equipped with terms which are equally elucidatory, at least in relation to the present topic of discussion, have added them as well). -->


Some Erasistrateans reduce the vessel called primary and simple into other elementary bodies.
- They should give up their opinion because they are also at variance with Erasistratus in this matter. 

Their hypothesis could not escape the difficulty regarding nutrition.
- It is not even in consonance with the view of Erasistratus.

<!-- when it declares that what he calls simple and primary is composite, and when it destroys the principle of Nature’s artistic skill.217  -->

For, if we do not grant a certain unity of substance218 to these simple structures as well, and if we arrive eventually at inharmonious and indivisible elements,219 we shall most assuredly deprive Nature of her artistic skill, as do all the physicians and philosophers who start from this hypothesis. 

For, according to such a hypothesis, Nature does not precede, but is secondary to the parts of the animal.

It is not the province of what comes secondarily, but of what pre-exists, to shape and to construct.

The faculties of Nature that shapes the animal and makes it grow and receive nourishment are present from the seed onwards.

Whereas none of these inharmonious and non-partite corpuscles contains within itself any formative, incremental, nutritive, or, in a word, any artistic power; it is, by hypothesis, unimpressionable and untransformable, whereas, as we have previously shown, none of the processes mentioned takes place without transformation, alteration, and complete intermixture. 

Owing to this necessity, those who belong to these sects are unable to follow out the consequences of their supposed elements.

They are all forced to declare Nature devoid of art. 

<!-- It is not from us, however, that the Erasistrateans should have learnt this, but from those very philosophers who lay most stress on a preliminary investigation into the elements of all existing things. -->



It is foolish for Erasistratus to assume Nature is artistically creative, while at the same time it breaks up substance into insensible, inharmonious, and untransformable elements.

If, however, he will grant that there occurs in the elements a process of alteration and transformation, and that there exists in them unity and continuity, then that simple vessel of his (as he himself names it) will turn out to be single and uncompounded. 

The simple vein will receive nourishment from itself, and the nerve and artery from the vein.

How, and in what way? 

<!-- For, when we were at this point before, we drew attention to the disagreement among the Erasistrateans and  -->

I showed that the nutrition of these simple vessels was impracticable according to the teachings of both parties, although we did not hesitate to adjudicate in their quarrel and to do Erasistratus the honour of placing him in the better sect.


I follow the doctrine which assumes this elementary nerve is a single, simple, and unified structure.

 <!-- and let us consider how it is to be nourished; for what is discovered here will at once be found to be common also to the school of Hippocrates. -->

It seems to me that our enquiry can be most rigorously pursued in subjects who are suffering from illness and have become very emaciated, since in these people all parts of the body are obviously atrophied and thin, and in need of additional substance and feeding-up; for the same reason the ordinary perceptible nerve, regarding which we originally began this discussion, has become thin, and requires nourishment. 

Now, this contains within itself various parts, namely, a great many of these primary, invisible, minute nerves, a few simple arteries, and similarly also veins. 

Thus, all its elementary nerves have themselves also obviously become emaciated; for, if they had not, neither would the nerve as a whole; and of course, in such a case, the whole nerve cannot require nourishment without each of these requiring it too. 

If on the one hand they stand in need of feeding-up, and if on the other the principle of the refilling of a vacuum can give them no help—both by reason of the difficulties previously mentioned and the actual thinness, as I shall show—we must then seek another cause for nutrition.

How is it, then, that the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled is unable to afford nourishment to one in such a condition? 

Because its rule is that only so much of the contiguous matter should succeed as has flowed away. 

This is sufficient for nourishment in the case of those who are in good condition, for, in them, what is presented must be equal to what has flowed away. 

But in the case of those who are very emaciated and who need a great restoration of nutrition, unless what was presented were many times greater than what has been emptied out, they would never be able to regain their original habit.

It is clear, therefore, that these parts will have to exert a greater amount of attraction, in so far as their requirements are greater. And I fail to understand how Erasistratus does not perceive that here again he is putting the cart before the horse. 

Because, in the case of the sick, there must be a large amount of presentation228 in order to feed them up, he argues that the factor of “refilling”227 must play an equally large part. 

How could much presentation take place if it were not preceded by an abundant delivery229 of nutriment? 

If he calls the conveyance of food through the veins delivery, and its assumption by each of these simple and visible nerves and arteries not delivery but distribution, as some people have thought fit to name it, and then ascribes conveyance through the veins to the principle of vacuum-refilling alone, let him explain to us the assumption of food by the hypothetical elements.231 

There is no such thing as the refilling of a vacuum especially where the parts are very attenuated.

Erasistratus writes about these cases in Book 2 of his “General Principles”: 

{{< q a="Erasistratus" >}}
In the ultimate simple [vessels], which are thin and narrow, presentation takes place from the adjacent vessels. The nutriment is attracted through the sides of the vessels and deposited in the empty spaces left by the matter which has been carried away.
{{< /q >}}


I accept the words “through the sides.” 

This is because if the simple nerve took in food through its mouth it would not be able to distribute it through its whole substance simce its mouth is dedicated to the psychic pneuma.232 

<!-- were actually to take in the food through its mouth,  -->

It can, however, take it in through its sides from the adjacent simple vein.

{{< q a="Erasistratus" >}}
The nutriment being attracted through the sides of the vessels
{{< /q >}}


I accept this.

 <!-- in Erasistratus’s statement the expression which precedes “through the sides.”  -->

I agree that it is attracted. But this is not through the tendency of evacuated matter to be replaced.
