{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
We should distinguish between heavy bodies in motion and the same bodies at rest.

A large stone placed in a balance not only acquires additional weight by having another stone placed upon it, but even by the addition of a handful of hemp its weight is augmented 6-10 ounces according to the quantity of hemp. 

But if you tie the hemp to the stone and allow them to fall freely from some height, do you believe that the hemp will press down upon the stone and thus accelerate its motion or do you think the motion will be retarded by a partial upward pressure? 

One always feels the pressure upon his shoulders when he prevents the motion of a load resting upon him; but if one descends just as rapidly as the load would fall how can it gravitate or press upon him? Do you not see that this would be the same as trying to strike a man with a lance when he is running away from you with a speed which is equal to, or even greater, than that with which you are following him? 

You must therefore conclude that, during free and natural fall, the small stone does not press upon the larger and consequently does not increase its weight as it does when at rest.

{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
But what if we should place the larger stone upon the smaller?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Its weight would be increased if the larger stone moved more rapidly.

When the small stone moves more slowly it retards to some extent the speed of the larger.

The combination of the two, which is a heavier body than the larger of the two stones, would move less rapidly.

This is contrary to your hypothesis.

We infer therefore that large and small bodies move with the same speed provided they are of the same specific gravity.

<!-- Your discussion is really admirable; yet I do not find it easy to believe that a bird-shot falls as swiftly as a cannon ball. -->

Why not say a grain of sand as rapidly as a grindstone? 

But, Simplicio, I trust you will not follow the example of many others who divert the discussion from its main intent and fasten upon some statement of mine which lacks a hair’s-breadth of the truth and, under this hair, hide the fault of another which is as big as a ship’s cable. 

Aristotle says that “an iron ball of one hundred pounds falling from a height of one hundred cubits reaches the ground before a one-pound ball has fallen a single cubit.” 

I say that they arrive at the same time. 

The larger outstrips the smaller by 2 finger-breadths. When the larger has reached the ground, the other is short of it by two finger-breadths.

Now you would not hide behind these two fingers the ninety-nine cubits of Aristotle, nor would you mention my small error and at the same time pass over in silence his very large one. 

Aristotle declares that bodies of different weights, in the same medium, travel (in so far as their motion depends upon gravity) with speeds which are proportional to their weights; this he illustrates by use of bodies in which it is possible to perceive the pure and unadulterated effect of gravity, eliminating other considerations, for example, figure as being of small importance [minimi momenti], influences which are greatly dependent upon the medium which modifies the single effect of gravity alone. Thus we observe that gold, the densest of all substances, when beaten out into a very thin leaf, goes floating through the air; the same thing happens with stone when ground into a very fine powder. 

But if you wish to maintain the general proposition you will have to show that the same ratio of speeds is preserved in the case of all heavy bodies, and that a stone of twenty pounds moves ten times as rapidly as one of two; but I claim that this is false and that, if they fall from a height of fifty or a hundred cubits, they will reach the earth at the same moment.

{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
The result would be different if the fall took place not from a few cubits but from some thousands of cubits.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
If this were what Aristotle meant you would burden him with another error which would amount to a falsehood; because, since there is no such sheer height available on earth, it is clear that Aristotle could not have made the experiment; yet he wishes to give us the impression of his having performed it when he speaks of such an effect as one which we see.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
In fact, Aristotle does not employ this principle, but uses the other one which is not, I believe, subject to these same difficulties.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
But the one is as false as the other; and I am surprised that you yourself do not see the fallacy and that you do not perceive that if it were true that, in media of different densities and different resistances, such as water and air, one and the same body moved in air more rapidly than in water, in proportion as the density of water is greater than that of air, then it would follow that any body which falls through air ought also to fall through water. But this conclusion is false inasmuch as many bodies which descend in air not only do not descend in water, but actually rise.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
I do not understand the necessity of your inference; and in addition I will say that Aristotle discusses only those bodies which fall in both media, not those which fall in air but rise in water.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
The arguments which you advance for the Philosopher are such as he himself would have certainly avoided so as not to aggravate his first mistake. But tell me now whether the density [corpulenza] of the water, or whatever it may be that retards the motion, bears a definite ratio to the density of air which is less retardative; and if so fix a value for it at your pleasure.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
Such a ratio does exist; let us assume it to be ten; then, for a body which falls in both these media, the speed in water will be ten times slower than in air.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
I shall now take one of those bodies which fall in air but not in water, say a wooden ball, and I shall ask you to assign to it any speed you please for its descent through air.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
Let us suppose it moves with a speed of 20.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
This speed bears to some smaller speed the same ratio as the density of water bears to that of air.

The value of this smaller speed is two.

So that really if we follow exactly the assumption of Aristotle we ought to infer that the wooden ball which falls in air, a substance ten times less-resisting than water, with a speed of 20 would fall in water with a speed of 2, instead of coming to the surface from the bottom as it does; unless perhaps you wish to reply, which I do not believe you will, that the rising of the wood through the water is the same as its falling with a speed of two. 

But since the wooden ball does not go to the bottom, I think you will agree with me that we can find a ball of another material, not wood, which does fall in water with a speed of two.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
Undoubtedly we can. But it must be of a substance considerably heavier than wood.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
That is it exactly. 

But if this second ball falls in water with a speed of two, what will be its speed of descent in air? If you hold to the rule of Aristotle you must reply that it will move at the rate of twenty; but twenty is the speed which you yourself have already assigned to the wooden ball; 

Hence this and the other heavier ball will each move through air with the same speed. But now how does the Philosopher harmonize this result with his other, namely, that bodies of different weight move through the same medium with different speeds—speeds which are proportional to their weights? 

But without going into the matter more deeply, how have these common and obvious properties escaped your notice? Have you not observed that two bodies which fall in water, one with a speed a hundred times as great as that of the other, will fall in air with speeds so nearly equal that one will not surpass the other by as much as one hundredth part? Thus, for example, an egg made of marble will descend in water one hundred times more rapidly than a hen’s egg, while in air falling from a height of twenty cubits the one will fall short of the other by less than 4 finger-breadths. 

In short, a heavy body which sinks through ten cubits of water in three hours will traverse ten cubits of air in one or two pulse-beats; and if the heavy body be a ball of lead it will easily traverse the ten cubits of water in less than double the time required for ten cubits of air.

The argument does not bear against the existence of a vacuum.

But if it did, it would only do away with vacua of considerable size which neither I nor, in my opinion, the ancients ever believed to exist in nature.

Although they might possibly be produced by force [violenza] as may be gathered from various experiments whose description would here occupy too much time.
