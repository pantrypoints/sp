In nature, the oldest topic is motion.

I have noted that the free motion [naturalem motum] of a heavy falling body is continuously accelerated.

But to just what extent this acceleration occurs has not yet been announced.

No one has yet pointed out that the distances traversed, during equal intervals of time, by a body falling from rest, stand to one another in the same ratio as the odd numbers beginning with unity.

Missiles and projectiles follow a curved path.
- However, no one has pointed out that this path is a parabola. 

I have proven this among others.

My work is the start if a new science.

This discussion is divided into 3 parts

1. Steady or uniform motion
2. Accelerated motion
3. Violent motions and with projectiles.


## Uniform Motion

In dealing with steady or uniform motion, we need a single definition which I give as follows:

### Definition

By steady or uniform motion, I mean one in which the distances traversed by the moving particle during any equal intervals of time, are themselves equal.

Caution

The old definition defined steady motion simply as one in which equal distances are traversed in equal times. I add the word “any” that means all equal intervals of time.

For it may happen that the moving body will traverse equal distances during some equal intervals of time and yet the distances traversed during some small portion of these time-intervals may not be equal, even though the time-intervals be equal.

From the above definition, four axioms follow, namely:


### Axiom 1

In the case of one and the same uniform motion, the distance traversed during a longer interval of time is greater than the distance traversed during a shorter interval of time.

### Axiom 2

In the case of one and the same uniform motion, the time required to traverse a greater distance is longer than the time required for a less distance.

### Axiom 3

In one and the same interval of time, the distance traversed at a greater speed is larger than the distance traversed at a less speed.

### Axiom 4

The speed required to traverse a longer distance is greater than that required to traverse a shorter distance during the same time-interval.


### Theorem 1, Proposition 1

If a moving particle, carried uniformly at a constant speed, traverses two distances the time-intervals required are to each other in the ratio of these distances.

Let a particle move uniformly with constant speed through two distances AB, BC, and let the time required to traverse AB be represented by DE; the time required to traverse BC, by EF; then I say that the distance AB is to the distance BC as the time DE is to the time EF.


Fig. 40

Let the distances and times be extended on both sides towards G, H and I, K; let AG be divided into any number whatever of spaces each equal to AB, and in like manner lay off in DI exactly the same number of time-intervals each equal to DE. 

Again lay off in CH any number whatever of distances each equal to BC; and in FK exactly the same number of time-intervals each equal to EF; then will the distance BG and the time EI be equal and arbitrary multiples of the distance BA and the time ED; and likewise the distance HB and the time KE are equal and arbitrary multiples of the distance CB and the time FE.

Since DE is the time required to traverse AB, the whole time EI will be required for the whole distance BG, and when the motion is uniform there will be in EI as many time-intervals each equal to DE as there are distances in BG each equal to BA; and likewise it follows that KE represents the time required to traverse HB.

Since, however, the motion is uniform, it follows that if the distance GB is equal to the distance BH, then must also the time IE be equal to the time EK; and if GB is greater than BH, then also IE will be greater than EK; and if less, less.

There are then 4 quantities:

1. AB
2. BC
3. DE
4. EF

The time IE and the distance GB are arbitrary multiples of the first and the third, namely of the distance AB and the time DE.

But it has been proved that both of these latter quantities are either equal to, greater than, or less than the time EK and the space BH, which are arbitrary multiples of the second and the fourth. Therefore the first is to the second, namely the distance AB is to the distance BC, as the third is to the fourth, namely the time DE is to the time EF.
