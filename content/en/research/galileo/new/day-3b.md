## Theorem 2, Proposition 2

If a moving particle traverses 2 distances in equal intervals of time, these distances will bear to each other the same ratio as the speeds. 

Conversely if the distances are as the speeds then the times are equal.

Referring to Fig. 40, let AB and BC represent the two distances traversed in equal time-intervals, the distance AB for instance with the velocity DE, and the distance BC with the velocity EF. 

Then the distance `AB` is to the distance BC as the velocity DE is to the velocity EF. For if equal multiples of both distances and speeds be taken, as above, namely, `GB` and `IE` of `AB` and DE respectively, and in like manner HB and KE of BC and EF, then one may infer, in the same manner as above, that the multiples GB and IE are either less than, equal to, or greater than equal multiples of BH and EK. Hence the theorem is established.



## Theorem 3, Proposition 3

In the case of unequal speeds, the time-intervals required to traverse a given space are to each other inversely as the speeds.

Let the larger of the two unequal speeds be indicated by A; the smaller, by B.

Let the motion corresponding to both traverse the given space `CD`. 

The time required to traverse the distance CD at speed A is to the time required to traverse the same distance at speed B, as the speed B is to the speed `A`. 

For let `CD` be to `CE` as `A` is to `B`.

Then, from the preceding, it follows that the time required to complete the distance `CD` at speed `A` is the same as the time necessary to complete `CE` at speed `B`.

But the time needed to traverse the distance `CE` at speed `B` is to the time required to traverse the distance `CD` at the same speed as `CE` is to CD; therefore the time in which `CD` is covered at speed `A` is to the time in which `CD` is covered at speed `B` as `CE` is to `CD`, that is, as speed B is to speed `A`.

## Theorem 4, Proposition 4

If 2 particles are carried with uniform motion, but each with a different speed, the distances covered by them during unequal intervals of time bear to each other the compound ratio of the speeds and time intervals.

Let the 2 particles which are carried with uniform motion be E and F and let the ratio of the speed of the body E be to that of the body F as A is to `B`. 

But let the ratio of the time consumed by the motion of `E` be to the time consumed by the motion of `F` as `C` is to `D`. 

Then, I say, that the distance covered by `E`, with speed `A` in time `C`, bears to the space traversed by `F` with speed `B` in time `D` a ratio which is the product of the ratio of the speed `A` to the speed `B` by the ratio of the time `C` to the time `D`. 

For if `G` is the distance traversed by E at speed A during the time-interval C, and if G is to I as the speed A is to the speed B; and if also the time-interval `C` is to the time-interval `D` as `I` is to `L`, then it follows that I is the distance traversed by F in the same time that G is traversed by E since G is to I in the same ratio as the speed A to the speed B.

Since `I` is to `L` in the same ratio as the time-intervals `C` and `D`, if `I` is the distance traversed by `F` during the interval `C`, then `L` will be the distance traversed by `F` during the interval `D` at the speed `B`.


Fig. 42

But the ratio of G to L is the product of the ratios G to I and I to L, that is, of the ratios of the speed A to the speed B and of the time-interval C to the time-interval D.

## Theorem 5, Proposition 5

If 2 particles are moved at a uniform rate, but with unequal speeds, through unequal distances, then the ratio of the time-intervals occupied will be the product of the ratio of the distances by the inverse ratio of the speeds.

Let the two moving particles be denoted by A and B, and let the speed of A be to the speed of B in the ratio of V to T; in like manner let the distances traversed be in the ratio of S to R; then I say that the ratio of the time-interval during which the motion of A occurs to the time-interval occupied by the motion of B is the product of the ratio of the speed T to the speed V by the ratio of the distance S to the distance R.


Fig. 43

Let `C` be the time-interval occupied by the motion of `A`, and let the time-interval `C` bear to a time-interval E the same ratio as the speed `T` to the speed `V`.

Since `C` is the time-interval during which `A`, with speed `V`, traverses the distance `S` and since `T`, the speed of `B`, is to the speed `V`, as the time-interval `C` is to the time-interval `E`, then E will be the time required by the particle `B` to traverse the distance `S`. 

If we let the time-interval `E` be to the time-interval `G` as the distance `S` is to the distance R, then it follows that G is the time required by B to traverse the space `R`. 

Since the ratio of C to G is the product of the ratios C to E and E to G (while also the ratio of C to E is the inverse ratio of the speeds of A and B respectively, i. e., the ratio of T to V); and since the ratio of E to G is the same as that of the distances S and R respectively, the proposition is proved.


## Theorem 6, Proposition 6

If 2 particles are carried at a uniform rate, the ratio of their speeds will be the product of the ratio of the distances traversed by the inverse ratio of the time-intervals occupied.

Let `A` and `B` be the two particles which move at a uniform rate; and let the respective distances traversed by them have the ratio of V to T, but let the time-intervals be as `S` to `R`. 

Then I say the speed of A will bear to the speed of B a ratio which is the product of the ratio of the distance V to the distance T and the time-interval R to the time-interval `S`.

Fig. 44

Let `C` be the speed at which `A` traverses the distance `V` during the time-interval `S`.

Let the speed `C` bear the same ratio to another speed E as V bears to T; then E will be the speed at which B traverses the distance T during the time-interval `S`. 

If now the speed `E` is to another speed `G` as the time-interval `R` is to the time-interval `S`, then G will be the speed at which the particle B traverses the distance T during the time-interval R. 

Thus, we have the speed `C` at which the particle `A` covers the distance V during the time S and also the speed G at which the particle B traverses the distance `T` during the time `R`. 

The ratio of `C` to `G` is the product of the ratio C to E and E to G; the ratio of C to E is by definition the same as the ratio of the distance V to distance `T`.

The ratio of `E` to `G` is the same as the ratio of R to S. Hence follows the proposition.

The preceding is what Galileo has written about uniform motion.

We pass now to a new and more discriminating consideration of naturally accelerated motion, such as that generally experienced by heavy falling bodies; following is the title and introduction.

## Naturally Accelerated Motion

The properties belonging to uniform motion have been discussed in the preceding section; but accelerated motion remains to be considered.

We must have a definition that best fits natural phenomena.

For anyone may invent an arbitrary type of motion and discuss its properties; thus, for instance, some have imagined helices and conchoids as described by certain motions which are not met with in nature, and have very commendably established the properties which these curves possess in virtue of their definitions; 

But we have decided to consider the phenomena of bodies falling with an acceleration such as actually occurs in nature and to make this definition of accelerated motion exhibit the essential features of observed accelerated motions. And this, at last, after repeated efforts we trust we have succeeded in doing. 

In this belief we are confirmed mainly by the consideration that experimental results are seen to agree with and exactly correspond with those properties which have been, one after another, demonstrated by us. Finally, in the investigation of naturally accelerated motion we were led, by hand as it were, in following the habit and custom of nature herself, in all her various other processes, to employ only those means which are most common, simple and easy.

For I think no one believes that swimming or flying can be accomplished in a manner simpler or easier than that instinctively employed by fishes and birds.

When, therefore, I observe a stone initially at rest falling from an elevated position and continually acquiring new increments of speed, why should I not believe that such increases take place in a manner which is exceedingly simple and rather obvious to everybody? 

If now we examine the matter carefully we find no addition or increment more simple than that which repeats itself always in the same manner. 

This we readily understand when we consider the intimate relationship between time and motion; for just as uniformity of motion is defined by and conceived through equal times and equal spaces (thus we call a motion uniform when equal distances are traversed during equal time-intervals), so also we may, in a similar manner, through equal time-intervals, conceive additions of speed as taking place without complication; thus we may picture to our mind a motion as uniformly and continuously accelerated when, during any equal intervals of time whatever, equal increments of speed are given to it. 

Thus if any equal intervals of time whatever have elapsed, counting from the time at which the moving body left its position of rest and began to descend, the amount of speed acquired during the first two time-intervals will be double that acquired during the first time-interval alone; so the amount added during three of these time-intervals will be treble; and that in four, quadruple that of the first time-interval. To put the matter more clearly, if a body were to continue its motion with the same speed which it had acquired during the first time-interval and were to retain this same uniform speed, then its motion would be twice as slow as that which it would have if its velocity had been acquired during two time-intervals.

Thus, we shall not be far wrong if we put the increment of speed as proportional to the increment of time; hence the definition of motion which we are about to discuss may be stated as follows: A motion is said to be uniformly accelerated, when starting from rest, it acquires, during equal time-intervals, equal increments of speed.
