<!-- I shall willingly pause, for I run the same risk too, and am on the verge of getting

I submit to the latter more willingly, as I am better satisfied with your architectonic and general discourse than with that of Aristotle. 

For yours satisfies me without the least misgiving, while the other blocks me in some way at every turn. 

Nor do I know why Simplicio should not be quickly satisfied with the argument you put forward to prove that motion in a straight line can have no place in nature, so long as we suppose the parts of the universe to be disposed in the best arrangement and perfectly ordered.
/r >}} -->

<!-- Stop there, Sagredo. for now a way occurs to me in which Simplicio may be given satisfaction, provided only that he does not wish to stay so closely tied to every phrase of Aristotle's as to hold it sacrilege to depart from a single one of them. -->

Only circular motion or rest can lead to the optimum placement and perfect order of the parts of the universe as to their local situation.

<!-- As to motion by a straight line, I do not see how it can be of use for anything except to restore to their natural location such integral bodies as have been accidentally removed and separated from their whole, as we have just said. -->

Let us now consider the whole terrestrial globe. What can happen to make it and the other world bodies keep themselves in the natural and best disposition?

It is either:
- at rest and remains perpetually immovable in its place, or
- it stays always in its place but revolves itself or
- it goes about a center, moving along the circumference of a circle

Of these, Aristotle and Ptolemy and all their followers say that it is the first which has always been observed.

So how can something not moving create a downward motion?

<!--  and which will be forever maintained; that is, perpetual rest in the same place. Now why, then, should they not have said from the start
that its natural property is to remain motionless, rather than making its natural motion
downward, a motion with which it never did and never will move?  -->


Nature uses straight line to restore particles of earth, water, air, fire, and every other integral mundane body to their whole when any of them are separated and transported into some improper place.
- This is unless it can be restored by finding some more appropriate circular motion. 

I think that this original position is better than to attribute straight motion as an intrinsic and natural principle of the elements. 

<!-- fits all the consequences much better, even by Aristotle's own method, -->

The Peripatetic believes that:
- celestial bodies are incorruptible and eternal
- the terrestrial globe is corruptible and mortal
- but there will not come a time when, the sun and moon and other stars continuing their existence and their operations, the earth will be annihilated along with the rest of the elements

<!-- and I am certain that he would answer, No.  -->

Therefore generation and corruption belong to the very small and superficial parts, and not to the whole.

<!-- ; indeed, to  which are insensible in comparison to the whole mass.  -->

Aristotle argues generation and corruption from the contrariety of straight motions.

So let us grant such motions to the parts, which alone change and decay.

But the whole globe and sphere of the elements will have either circular motion or perpetual rest.

 <!-- continuance in its proper place -- the only tendencies fined for the perpetuation and maintenance of perfect order. -->

What is thus said of earth may be said as reasonably of fire and of the greater part of the air, to which elements 

The Peripatetics are forced to:
- assign an intrinsic and natural motion
- abolish from nature that motion with which they move, have moved, and are to be moved perpetually. 

 <!-- one with which they were never moved and never will be, and to  -->


This is because they assign an upward motion to air and fire.
- This is a motion that never belongs to the said elements, but only to some of their particles
- This only happens to restore them to perfect arrangement when they are out of their natural places

On the other hand, they call circular motion (with which they are incessantly moved) preternatural to them, forgetting what Aristotle has said many times, that nothing violent can last very long.

To all these things we have the most suitable answers, which I omit for the present in order that we may come to the particular reasons and sensible experiments which should be finally preferred, as Aristotle well says, above anything that can be supplied by human argument.

{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
So which of 2 general arguments has the more probability?

1. Aristotle writes that sublunar bodies are by nature generable and corruptible, etc.

Therefore they are very different in essence from celestial bodies, these being invariant, ingenerable, incorruptible, etc. This argument is deduced from differences of simple motions. 

2. Salviati assumes the integral parts of the world to be disposed in the best order, and as a necessary consequence excludes straight motions for simple natural bodies as being of
no use in nature.

He takes the earth to be another of the celestial bodies, endowed with all the prerogatives that belong to them.

The latter reasoning suits me better up to this point than the other. 

Therefore let Simplicio be good enough to produce all the specific arguments, experiments, and observations, both physical and astronomical, by which one may be fully persuaded that the earth differs from the celestial bodies, is immovable, and is located in the center of the universe, or anything else that would exclude the earth from being movable like a planet such as Jupiter, or the moon, etc. 

<!-- And you, Salviati, have the kindness to reply step by step. -->
