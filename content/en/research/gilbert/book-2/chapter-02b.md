<!-- Right subjection is that from which is emitted the emanation which attracts and which in mixtures often lies hidden on account of their lack of form, by reason of which they are often different in act from what they are in potency.  -->

Hairs and twigs move towards amber and towards diamond not because they are hairs, but because they have air in them which:
- is attracted
- has some relation to that which attracts it

Diamond and amber have this principle common to both. 

This is why Fracastorio is wrong.

If he had observed by many experiments that all bodies are drawn to electricks except those which are aglow and aflame, and highly rarefied then he would never have given a thought to such things. 

<!-- It is easy for men of acute intellect, apart from experiments and practice, to slip and err.  -->

<!-- SOme maintain that:
- these same substances are not similar, but to be substances near akin and hold that on that account a thing moves towards another, its like, by which it is brought to more perfection. 

But these are ill-considered views. -->

For towards all electricks all things move except such as are aflame or are too highly rarefied, as air, which is the universal effluvium of this globe and of the world. 

Vegetable substances draw moisture by which their shoots are rejoiced and grow.

From analogy with that, however, Hippocrates, in his De Natura Hominis, Book I., wrongly concluded that the purging of morbid humour took place by the specifick force of the drug. 

Concerning the action and potency of purgatives we shall speak elsewhere. 

Wrongly also is attraction inferred in other effects; as in the case of a flagon full of water, when buried in a heap of wheat, although well stoppered, the moisture is drawn out; since this moisture is rather resolved into vapour by the emanation of the fermenting wheat, and the wheat imbibes the freed vapour. 

Nor do elephants' tusks attract moisture, but drive it into vapour or absorb it. 

Thus then very many things are said to attract, the reasons for whose energy must be sought from other causes. 

Amber in a fairly large mass allures, if* it is polished; in a smaller mass or less pure it seems not to attract without friction. 

But very many electricks (as precious stones and some other substances) do not attract at all unless rubbed. 

On the other hand, many gems and other bodies, are polished, yet do not allure, and by no amount of friction are they aroused.

Thus the emerald, agate, carnelian, pearls, jasper, chalcedony, alabaster, porphyry, coral, the marbles, touchstone, flint, bloodstone, emery[131], do not acquire any power; nor do bones, or ivory, or the hardest woods, as ebony, nor do cedar, juniper, or cypress; nor do metals, silver, gold, brass, iron, nor any loadstone, though many of them are finely polished and shine. 

On the other hand, there are some other polished substances of which we have spoken before, toward which, when they have been rubbed, bodies incline. 

<!-- This we shall understand only when we have more closely looked into the prime origin of bodies.  -->

All admit that the mass of the earth, or rather the structure and crust of the earth, consists of a twofold material:

1. Fluid and humid matter
2. More consistent and dry matter

From this twofold nature or the more simple compacting of one, various substances take their rise among us, which originate in greater proportion now from the earthy, now from the aqueous nature. 

Those substances which have received their chief growth from moisture, whether aqueous or fatty, or have taken on their form by a simpler compacting from them, or have been compacted from these same materials in long ages, if they have a sufficiently firm hardness, if rubbed after they have been polished and when they remain bright with the friction—towards those substances everything, if presented to them in the air, turns, if its too heavy weight does not prevent it. 

For amber has been compacted of moisture, and jet also. Lucid gems are made of water; just as Crystal[132], which has been concreted from clear water, not {52}always by a very great cold, as some used to judge, and by very hard frost, but sometimes by a less severe one, the nature of the soil fashioning it, the humour or juices being shut up in definite cavities, in the way in which spars are produced in mines. 

So clear glass is fused out of sand, and from other substances, which have their origin in humid juices. 

But the dross of metals, as also metals, stones, rocks, woods, contain earth rather, or are mixed with a good deal of earth; *and therefore they do not attract. Crystal, mica, glass, and all electricks do not attract if they are burnt or roasted; for their primordial supplies of moisture perish by heat, and are changed and exhaled. 

All things therefore which have sprung from a predominant moisture and are firmly concreted, and retain the appearance of spar and its resplendent nature in a firm and compact body, allure all bodies, whether humid or dry. 

Those, however, which partake of the true earth-substance or are very little different from it, are seen to attract also, but from a far different reason, and (so to say) magnetically; concerning these we intend to speak afterwards. 

But those substances which are more mixed of water and earth, and are produced by the equal degradation of each element (in which the magnetick force of the earth is deformed and remains buried; while the watery humour, being fouled by joining with a more plentiful supply of earth, has not concreted in itself but is mingled with earthy matter), can in no way of themselves attract or move from its place anything which they do not touch. 

On this account metals, marbles, flints, woods, herbs, flesh, and very many other things can neither allure nor solicit any body either magnetically or electrically. (For it pleases us to call that an electrick force, which hath *its origin from the humour.) 

But substances consisting mostly of humour, and which are not very firmly compacted by nature (whereby do they neither bear rubbing, but either melt down and become soft, or are not levigable, such as pitch, the softer kinds of resin, camphor, galbanum, ammoniack[133], storax, asafœtida, benzoin, asphaltum, especially in rather warm weather) towards them small bodies are not borne; for without rubbing most electricks do not *emit their peculiar and native exhalation and effluvium. 

The resin turpentine when liquid does not attract; for it cannot be rubbed; but if it has hardened into a mastick it does attract. But now at length we must understand why small bodies turn towards those substances which have drawn their origin from water; by what force and with what hands (so to speak) electricks seize upon kindred natures. 

In all bodies in the world two causes or principles have been laid down, from which the bodies themselves were produced, matter and form[134]. 

Electrical motions become strong from matter, but magnetick from form chiefly.

They differ widely from one another and turn out unlike, since the one is ennobled by numerous virtues and is prepotent; the other is ignoble and of less potency, and mostly restrained, as it were, within certain barriers; and therefore that force must at times be aroused by attrition or friction, until it is at a dull heat and gives off an effluvium and a polish is induced on the body. For spent air, either blown out of the mouth or given* off from moister air, chokes the virtue. 

If either a sheet of paper or a piece of linen be interposed, there will be no movement. But a loadstone, without friction or heat, whether dry or suffused with moisture, as well in air as in water, invites magneticks, even with the most solid bodies interposed, even planks of wood or pretty thick slabs of stone or sheets of metal. A loadstone appeals to magneticks* only; towards electricks all things move.

A loadstone raises great weights.

So that if there is a loadstone weighing two ounces and strong, it attracts half an ounce or a whole ounce. An electrical substance only attracts very small weights; as, for instance, a piece of amber of three ounces weight, when rubbed, scarce raises a fourth part of a grain of barley.

But this attraction of amber and of electrical substances must be further investigated; and since there is this particular affection of matter, it may be asked why is amber rubbed, and what affection is produced by the rubbing, and what causes arise which make it lay hold on everything? 

As a result of friction it grows slightly warm and becomes smooth; two results which must often occur together. 

A large polished fragment of amber or jet attracts indeed, even without friction, but less strongly; but if it be brought gently near a flame or a live coal, so that it equally becomes warm, it does not attract small bodies because* it is enveloped in a cloud from the body of the flaming substance, which emits a hot breath, and then impinges upon it vapour from a foreign body which for the most part is at variance with the nature of amber. 

Moreover the spirit of the amber which is called forth is enfeebled by alien heat; wherefore it ought not to have heat excepting that produced by motion only and friction, and, as it were, its own, not sent into it by other bodies.

For as the igneous heat emitted from any burning substance cannot be so used that electricks may acquire their force from it.

So also heat from the solar rays does not fit an electrick by the loosening of its* right material, because it dissipates rather and consumes it (albeit a body which has been rubbed retains its virtue longer exposed to the rays of the sun than in the shade; because in the shade the effluvia are condensed to a greater degree and more quickly). 

Then again the fervour from the light of the Sun aroused by means of a* burning mirror confers no vigour on the heated amber[136]; indeed it dissipates and corrupts all the electrick effluvia. 

Again, burning* sulphur and hard wax, made from shell-lac, when aflame do not allure; for heat from friction resolves bodies into effluvia, which flame consumes away.

For it is impossible for solid electricks to be resolved into their own true effluvia otherwise than by attrition, save {54}in the case of certain substances which by reason of innate vigour emit effluvia constantly. 

They are rubbed with bodies which do not befoul their surface, and which produce a polish, as pretty stiff silk or a rough wool rag which is as little soiled as possible, or the dry palm. 

Amber also is rubbed with amber, with diamond, and with glass, and numerous other substances. 

Thus these are electricks manipulated.

What moves in it?

Is it the body itself, inclosed within its own circumference? 

Or is it something imperceptible to us, which flows out from the substance into the ambient air?
