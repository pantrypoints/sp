What are magnetick circles and limits?

Astronomers settled upon certain circles and definite limits in the sky in order to:
- understand and observe methodically the motion of the planets and the revolution of the heavens
- accurately describe the celestial attire of the fixed stars
- delineate the varied face of the earth and the beauty of its districts

But we differ from them.

We recognize those limits and circles and have found many fixed by nature, not merely conceived by the imagination, both in the earth and in our terrella. 

Astronomers mark out the earth chiefly by means of the æquator and the poles.

Those limits have been arranged and marked out by nature. 

The meridians also indicate straight paths from pole to pole through distinct points on the æquator; by which way the magnetick virtue directs its course and moves. 

But the tropics and arctic circles, as also the parallels, are not natural limits placed on the earth; but all parallel circles indicate a certain agreement of the lands situated in the same latitude, or diametrically opposite. All these the Mathematicians use for convenience, painting them on globes and maps. 

In like manner also in a terrella all these are required; not, however, in order that its exterior appearance may be geographically delineated, since the loadstone may be perfect, even, and uniform on all sides. 

There are no upper and lower parts in the earth, nor are there in a terrella; unless perchance some one considers those parts superior which are in the periphery, and those inferior which are situated more towards the centre.


## Chapter 9: The Equinoctial Circle of the Earth and of a Terrella

The æquinoctial circle is equidistant from both poles, cutting the world in the middle.

It measures the motions of their primum mobile or tenth sphere, and is named the zone of the primum mobile. 

It is called æquinoctial because when the sun stands in it (which must happen twice in the year) the days are equal to the nights. 

That circle is also spoken of as æquidialis, wherefore it is called by the Greeks ἰσημερινός. 

In like manner, it is also properly called Æquator, because it divides the whole frame of the earth between the poles into equal parts. 

So also an æquator may be rightly assigned to a terrella, by which its power is naturally divided, and by the plane of which permeating through its centre, the whole globe is divided into equal parts both in quantity and strength (as if by a transverse septum) between verticities on both sides imbued with equal vigour.



## Chapter 10: Magnetick Meridians of the Earth

Meridians have been thought out by the geographer, by means of which he might both distinguish the longitude and measure the latitude of each region. 

But the magnetick meridians are infinite, running in the same direction also, through fixed and opposite limits on the æquator, and through the poles themselves. 

On them also the magnetick latitude is measured, and declinations are reckoned from them; and the fixed direction in them tends to the poles, unless it varies from some defect and the magnetick is disturbed from the right way. 

What is commonly called a magnetick meridian is not really magnetick, nor is it really a meridian.

But it is understood to pass through the termini of the variation on the horizon. 

The variation is a depraved deviation from a meridian, nor is it fixed and constant in various places on any meridian.
