Conceive a small round plate, concave in shape, of the breadth of a digit to be applied to the convex polar surface of a loadstone and skilfully attached.

Or a piece of iron shaped like an acorn, rising from the base into an obtuse cone, hollowed out a little and fitted to the surface of the stone, to be tied to the loadstone. Let the iron be the best steel, smoothed, shining, and even.

A loadstone with such an appliance, which before only bore four ounces of iron, will now raise twelve. But the greatest force of a combining or rather united nature is seen when two loadstones, armed with iron caps, are so joined by their concurrent (commonly called contrary) ends, that they mutually *attract and raise one another. 

In this way a weight of twenty ounces is raised, when either stone unarmed would only allure four ounces of iron. 

Iron unites to an armed loadstone more firmly than to a loadstone; and on that account raises greater weights, because the pieces of iron stick more pertinaciously to one that is armed. 

For by the near presence of the magnet they are cemented together, and since the armature[173] conceives a magnetick vigour from its presence and the other conjoined piece of iron is at the same time endued with vigour from the presence of the loadstone, they are firmly bound together. 

Therefore by the mutual contact of strong pieces of iron, the cohesion is strong. 

Which thing is also made clear and is exhibited by means of rods sticking together, Bk. 3, chap 4.

And also when the question of the concretion of iron dust into a united body was discussed. For this reason a piece of iron set near a loadstone draws away any suitable piece of iron from the loadstone, if only it touch the iron; otherwise it does not snatch it away, though in closest proximity. 

For magnetick pieces of iron within the orbe of virtue, or near a loadstone, do not rush together with a greater endeavour[175] than the iron and the magnet; but joined they are united more strongly and, as it were, cemented together, though the substance remain the same with the same forces acting.
