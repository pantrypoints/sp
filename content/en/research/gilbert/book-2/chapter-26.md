Why is there more love between iron and loadstone than between loadstone and loadstone, or between iron and iron, when close to the loadstone, within its orbe of virtue?


Magnet attracts magnet, not in every part and on every side with equal conditions, as iron, but at one and a fixed point.

Therefore, the poles of both must be exactly disposed, otherwise they do not cleave together duly and strongly. 

But this disposition is not easy and expeditious; wherefore a loadstone seems not to conform to a loadstone, when nevertheless they agree very well together. 

A piece of iron by the sudden impression of a loadstone is not only allured by the stone, but is renewed, its forces being drawn forth; by which it follows and solicits the loadstone with no less impulse, and even leads another piece of iron captive. 

Let there be a small iron spike above a loadstone clinging firmly to it.

If you apply an unmagnetized rod of iron to the spike, not, however, so that it touches the stone, you will see the spike when it has touched the iron, leaving the loadstone, follow the rod, try to grasp it by leaning toward it, and (if it should touch it) cleave firmly to it: for a piece of iron, when united and joined to another piece of iron placed within the orbe of virtue of the loadstone, draws it more strongly than does the loadstone itself. 

The natural magnetick virtue, confused and dormant in the iron, is aroused by the loadstone, is linked to the loadstone, and rejoices with it in its primary form; then smelted iron becomes a perfect magnetick, as robust as the loadstone itself. 

For as the one imparts and stirs, so the other conceives, and being stirred remains in virtue, and pours back the forces also by its own activity. 

But since iron is more like iron than loadstone, and the virtue in both pieces of iron is exalted by the proximity of the loadstone, so in the loadstone itself, in case of equal strength, likeness of substance prevails, and iron gives itself up rather to iron, and they are united by their very similar homogenic powers. 

Which thing happens not so much from a coition, as from a firmer unition; and a knob or snout of steel, fixed skilfully on the pole of the stone, raises greater weights of iron than the stone of itself could. 

When steel or iron is smelted from loadstone or iron ore, the slag and corrupt substances are separated from the better by the fusion of the material; whence (in very large measure) that iron contains the nature of the earth, purified from alien flaw and blemish, and more homogenic and perfect, though deformed by the fusion.

When that material indeed is provoked by a loadstone, it conceives the magnetick virtues, and within their orbe is raised in strength more than the weaker loadstone, which with us is often not free from some admixture of impurities.
