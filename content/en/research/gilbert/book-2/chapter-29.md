Quite similar in potency are those stones which are of the same mine, and not corrupted by adjacent ores or veins. 

Nevertheless that which excels in size shows greater powers, since it seizes greater weights and has a wider orbe of virtue. 

For a loadstone weighing one ounce does not lift a large nail as does one weighing a pound, nor does it rule so widely, nor extend its forces; and if from a loadstone of a pound weight a portion is taken away, something of its power will be seen to go also; for when a portion is abstracted the virtue is lessened. 

But if that part is properly applied and united to it, though it is not fastened to nor grown into it, yet by the application it obtains its pristine power and its vigour returns. 

Sometimes, however, when a part is taken away, the virtue turns out to be stronger on account of the *bad shape of the stone, namely, when the vigour is scattered through inconvenient angles. 

In various species the ratio is various, for one stone of a drachm weight draws more than another of twenty pounds. Since in very many the influence is so effete that it can hardly be perceived, those weak stones are surpassed by prepared pieces of clay.

If a stone of the same species and goodness weighing a drachm would seize upon a drachm of iron, would a stone of an ounce weight seize on an ounce, a pound on a pound, and so on? 

This is true.

For it both strains and remits its strength proportionately, so that if a loadstone, one drachm of which would attract one drachm of iron, were in equal proportion applied either to a suitably large obelisk or to an immense pyramid of iron, it would lift it directly in such proportion and would draw it towards itself with no greater effort of its nature or trouble than a loadstone of a drachm weight embraces a drachm. But in all such experiments as this let the vigour of the magnets be equal.

Let there be also a just proportion in all of the shapes of the stones, and let the shape of the iron to be attracted be the same, and the goodness of the metal, and let the position of the poles of the loadstones be most exact. This is also no less true in the case of an armed loadstone than of an unarmed one. 

For the sake of experiment, let there be given a loadstone of 8 ounces weight, which when armed lifts twelve ounces of iron.

If you cut off from that loadstone a certain portion, which when it has been reduced to the shape of the former whole one is then only of two ounces, such a loadstone armed lifts a piece of iron applied to it of 3 ounces, in proportion to the mass. 

In this experiment also the piece of iron of three ounces ought to have the same shape as the former one of twelve ounces; if that rose up into a cone, it is necessary that this also in the ratio of its mass should be given a pyramidal shape proportioned to the former.



## Chapter 30: The Shape and Mass of the Iron are of most importance in coition.

Observation has shown above that the shape and mass of the loadstone have great influence in magnetick coitions; likewise also the shape and mass of the iron bodies give back more powerful and steady forces. 

Oblong iron rods are both drawn more quickly to a loadstone and cleave to it with greater obstinacy than round or square pieces, for the same reasons which we have proven in the case of the loadstone. 

But, moreover, this is also worthy of observation, that a smaller piece of iron, to which is hung a weight of another material, so that it is altogether in weight equal to another large whole piece of iron of a right weight (as regards the strength of the loadstone), is not lifted by the loadstone as the larger piece of iron would be. 

For a smaller piece of iron does not join with a loadstone so firmly, because it sends back less strength, and only that which is magnetick conceives strength; the foreign material hung on cannot acquire magnetick forces.


## Chapter 31. Long and Round Stones

Pieces of iron join more firmly with a long stone than with a round one, provided that the pole of the stone is at the extremity and end of its length; because, forsooth, in the case of a long stone, a magnetick is directed at the end straight towards the body in which the virtue proceeds in straighter lines and through the longer diameter. 

But a somewhat long stone has but little power on the side, much less indeed than a round one. It is demonstrable[180], indeed, that at A and B the coition is stronger in a round stone than at C and D, at like distances from the pole.

Long and Round Stones.
