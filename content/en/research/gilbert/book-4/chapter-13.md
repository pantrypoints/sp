This is partly from:
- error and inexperience
- the imperfections of the instruments
- the sea being seldom so calm that the shadows or lights can remain quite steady on the instruments.

After the variation of the compass had first been noticed, some diligent navigators took pains to investigate the difference of aspect of the mariners' compass. 

Yet, to the great detriment of the nautical art, this has not been done properly. 

They have:
- not understood any accurate method
- used bad instruments

They merely followed some conjecture from an ill-formed opinion as to some prime meridian or magnetick pole.

 <!-- whilst others again transcribe from others, and parade these observations as their own; and they who, very unskilful themselves, first of all committed their observations to writing are, as by the prerogative of time, held in esteem by others, and their posterity does not think it safe to differ from them.  -->

Hence in long navigations, especially to the East Indies, the records by the Portuguese of the deviating compass are seen to be unskilful.

They are in error in very many things, and do not rightly understand the construction of the Portuguese compass (the lily of which diverges by half a rumbe from the needles toward the west), nor its use in taking the variation. 

They show the variation of the compass in different places, it is uncertain whether they measure the deviation by a true meridional compass or by some other whose needles are displaced from the lily.

The Portuguese make use of the Portuguese compass, whose magnetick needles are fixed aside from the lily by half of one rumbe toward the east.

Moreover on the sea the observation of the variation is a matter of great difficulty, on account of the motion of the ship and the uncertainty of the deviation, even with the more skilful observers, if they use the best made instruments hitherto known and used. 

Hence there arise different opinions on the magnetick deviation.

For instance, near the Island of St. Helena the Portuguese Rodriguez de Lagos measures half a rumbe. 

The Dutch in their nautical log fix it at a whole rumbe. Kendall, the expert Englishman, with a true meridional compass admits only a sixth part of a rumbe. 

A little to the East of Cape Agullias Diego Alfonso makes no variation.

He shows by an Astrolabe that the compass remains in the true meridian. Rodriguez shows that the compass at Cape Agulhas has no variation if it is of Portuguese construction, in which the needles are inclined half a rumbe to the East. And there is the same confusion, negligence, and vanity in very many other instances.


## Chapter 14. The variation under the æquinoctial line, and near it.

In the North the magnetick needle varies because of the Boreal eminences of the continent; in the South because of the Austral; at the æquator, if the regions on both sides were equal, there would be no variation. 

But because this rarely happens some variation is often observed under the æquator; and even at some distance from the æquator of three or 4 degrees toward the North, there may be a variation arising from the south, if those very wide and influential southern continents be somewhat near on one side.
