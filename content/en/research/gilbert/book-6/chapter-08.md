Primitive mathematicians did not pay attention to the inequælities of the years. They made no distinction between the æquinoctial, or solstitial revolving year, and that which is taken from some one of the fixed stars. 

Even the Olympick years, which they used to reckon from the rising of the dogstar, they thought to be the same as those counted from the solstice. 

Hipparchus of Rhodes was the first to call attention to the fact that these differ from each other, and discovered that the year was longer when measured by the fixed stars than by the æquinox or solstice: whence he supposed that there was in the fixed stars also some motion in a common sequence; but very slow, and not at once perceptible. 

After him Menelaus, a Roman geometer, then Ptolemy, and long afterward Mahometes Aractensis, and several more, in all their literary memoirs, perceived that the fixed stars and the whole firmament proceeded in an orderly sequence, regarding as they did the heaven, not the earth, and not understanding the magnetical inclinations. 

It comes rather from a rotatory motion of the Earth's axis, than that that eighth sphære (so called) the firmament, or non-moving empyrean, revolves studded with innumerable globes and stars, whose distances from the Earth have never been proved by anyone, nor can be proved (the whole universe gliding, as it were). 

<!-- And surely it should seem much more likely that the appearances in the heavens should be clearly accounted for by a certain inflection and inclination of the comparatively small body of the Earth, than by the setting in motion of the whole system of the universe; especially if this motion is to be regarded as ordained solely for the Earth's advantage: While for the fixed stars, or for the planets, it is of no use at all. For  -->

This motion the rising and settings of stars in every Horizon, as well as their culminations at the height of the heavens, are shifted so much that the stars which once were vertical are now some degrees distant from the zenith. 

For nature has taken care, through the Earth's soul or magnetick vigour, that, just as it was needful in tempering, receiving, and warding off the sun's rays and light, by suitable seasons, that the points toward which the Earth's pole is directed should be 23 degrees and more from the poles of the Ecliptick: 

So now for moderating and for receiving the luminous rays of the fixed stars in due turn and succession, the Earth's poles should revolve at the same distance from the Ecliptick at the Ecliptick's arctick circle; or rather that they should creep at a gentle pace, that the actions of the stars should not always remain at the same parallel circles, but should have a rather slow mutation. For the influences of the stars are not so forceful as that a swifter course should be desired.

Slowly, then, is the Earth's axis inflected; and the stars' rays, falling upon the face of the Earth, shift only in so long a time as a diameter of the arctick or polar circle is extended: whence the star at the extremity of the tail of the Cynosure, which once was 12 degrees 24 minutes (namely, in the time of Hipparchus) distant from the pole of the universe, or from that point which the pole of the Earth used to face, is now only 2 degrees and 52 minutes distant from the same point; whence from its nearness it is called by the moderns Polaris. Some time it will be only ½ degree away from the pole: afterward it will begin to recede from the pole until it will be 48 degrees distant; and this, according to the Prutenical tables, will be in Anno Domini 15000. 

Thus Lucida Lyræ (which to us southern Britons now almost culminates) will some time approach to the pole of the world, to about the fifth degree. 

So all the stars shift their rays of light at the surface of the Earth, through this wonderful magnetical inflection of the Earth's axis. 

Hence come new varieties of the seasons of the year, and lands become more fruitful or more barren; hence the characters and manners of nations are changed; kingdoms and laws are altered, in accordance with the virtue of the fixed stars as they culminate, and the strength thence received or lost in accordance with the singular and specifick nature of each; or on account of new configurations with the planets in other places of the Zodiack; on account also of risings and settings, and of new concurrences at the meridian. 

The Præcession of the æquinoxes arising from the aequable motion of the Earth's pole in the arctick circle of the Zodiack is here demonstrated. Let A B C D be the Ecliptick line; I E G the arctic circle of the Zodiack. 

Then if the Earth's pole look to E, the æquinoxes are at D, C. Let this be at the time of Metho, when the horns of Aries were in the æquinoctial colure. 

If the Earth's pole have advanced to I; then the æquinoxes will be at K, L; and the stars in the ecliptick C will seem to have progressed, in the order of the signs, along the whole arc K C: L will be moved on by the præcession, against the order of the signs, along the arc D L. But this would occur in the contrary order, if the point G were to face the poles of the earth, and the motion were from E to G: for then the æquinoxes would be M N, and the fixed stars would anticipate the same at C and D, counter to the order of the signs.

Motion of the earth's pole.
