<!-- I wrote this six years ago, but even at this day the physicians of the old school continue to act and teach with the same criminal negligence. In this most important medical affair they have up to this day not become the least bit wiser or more humane. -->

The older physicians were more conscientious. They saw clearly that innumerable ailments and the most severe chronic diseases follow the destruction of the itch-eruption from the skin.

This compelled them to assume the existence of an internal disease, in every case of itch they endeavor to extirpate this internal malady by means of a multitude of internal remedies, as good as their therapeutics afforded. 

It was useless because the true method of healing, which it could only be the prerogative of Homoeopathy to discover, was unknown to them.

Nevertheless this sincere endeavor was praiseworthy, since it was founded on an appreciation of the great internal disease present, together with the eruption of itch, which internal disease it was necessary to remove.

This prevented their reliance on the mere local destruction of the itch from the skin, as practiced by modern physicians, who think that they cannot quickly enough drive it away - as if it were a mere external disease of the skin - without regarding the great injuries attending such a course. The older physicians, on the other hand, have warningly laid these injuries before our eyes in their writings, giving thousands of examples.

* By accident (for they cannot give any but a feigned reason for their action) they found out a refuge which temporarily often alleviates the sufferings of their patients when they cannot do anything at home with their prescriptions against the unknown disease; that is, they send him to some sulphur hath or other, where the patients often get rid of a small part of their Psora, and thus are also at the first use of the baths for a time relieved of their chronic disease; but afterwards they fall back into the same or a kindred ailment, and the repetition of the bath then avails little or nothing, because the cure of a developed Psora requires a far more adequate treatment than the impetuous use of such baths.

The observations of those honest men are too startling to be rejected contemptuously, or ignored by conscientious men.

<!-- I shall here adduce some of these numerous observations handed down to us, which I might increase by an equal number of my own if the former were not already abundantly sufficient to show with what fury  -->

The internal Psora manifests itself when the external local symptom which serves to assuage the internal malady is hastily removed. 

They also show that it must be a matter of conscience for the physician who loves his fellow-man to direct all his endeavors to cure, first of all, the internal malady, whereby the cutaneous eruption will at the same time be removed and destroyed and all the subsequent innumerable lifelong chronic sufferings springing from the Psora be prevented or, if they are already embittering the life of the patient, be cured.

The diseases, partly acute but chiefly chronic, springing from such a one-sided destruction of the chief skin-symptom (eruption and itching) which acts vicariously and assuages the internal Psora (which destruction is erroneously called "Driving the itch into the body") are innumerable; as manifold as the peculiarities of bodily constitutions and of the outer world which modifies them.

A brief survey of the misfortunes resulting is given by the experienced and honest Ludwig Christian Juncker in his Dissertatio de Darnno ex Scabie Repulsa, Halle, 1750, p. 15-18. 

He observed that with young people of a sanguine temperament the suppression of itch is followed by phthisis, and with persons in general who are of a sanguine temperament it is followed by piles, hemorrhoidal colic and renal gravel; with persons of sanguino-choleric temperament by swellings of the inguinal glands, stiffening of the joints and malignant ulcers (called in German Todenbruiche); with fat persons by a suffocating catarrh and mucous consumption; also by inflammatory fever, acute pleurisy and inflammation of the lungs. He further states that in autopsies the lungs have been found indurated and full of cysts containing pus; also other indurations, swellings of the bones and ulcers have been seen to follow the suppression of an eruption. 

Phlegmatic persons in consequence of such suppressions suffered chiefly from dropsy; the menses were delayed, and when the itch was driven away during their flow, they were changed into a monthly hemoptysis. Persons inclined to melancholy were sometimes made insane by such repression; if they were pregnant the foetus was usually killed. Sometimes the suppression of the itch causes sterility,* in nursing women the milk is generally lacking, the menses disappear prematurely; in older women the uterus becomes ulcerated, attended with deep, burning pains, with wasting away (cancer of the womb).

His experiences were frequently confirmed by the observations + of others, as e. g. with reference to:
