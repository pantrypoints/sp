A 3-year-old girl had the itch, for several weeks. When this was driven out by an ointment, she was seized the next day:
- by a suffocating catarrh with snoring
- with numbness and coldness of the whole body, from which she did not recover until the itch reappeared.

9 A 12-year old girl had the itch with which she had frequently suffered. It was driven away from the skin by an ointment. She was then seized with an acute fever with suffocative catarrh, asthma and swelling, and afterward with pleurisy. 

Six days later, having taken an internal medicine containing sulphur, the itch again appeared and all the ailments, excepting the swelling, disappeared. 

But after 24 days, the itch again dried up. It was followed by a new inflammation in the chest with pleurisy and vomiting.

10 The dyspnoea of a youth, 20 years, caused by the driving away of itch was so great that he could not get any breath, and his pulse was hardly perceptible, in consequence of which he suffocated.


11 A moist herpes on the left upper arm of a youth of 19 years was finally locally removed by many external applications. But soon after, there ensued a periodical asthma which was suddenly increased by a lengthy foot-tour in the heat of summer, even to suffocation, with a puffed up bluish-red face and quick, weak, uneven pulse.


12 The dyspnoea from the driven out itch came on very suddenly, and the patient was suffocated.

13 A. 5-year-old girl had had for some time large itch vesicles on the hands, which dried up of themselves. Shortly after, she became sleepy and tired and was seized with dyspnoea. The following day the asthma continued and her abdomen became distended.

14 A 50-year-old farmer, who had been long tortured with the itch, while he was driving it out by external applications, was seized with a dyspnoea, a loss of appetite and a swelling of the whole body.

15 A girl in Bologna drove away the itch with an ointment and was seized with the most severe asthma without fever. After two blood-lettings her strength decreased so much and the asthma was so much augmented that she died on the following day. The whole chest was filled with bluish water, also the pericardium.

16 A girl of 9 years with the tinea capitis had it driven away, when she was seized with a lingering fever, a general swelling and dyspnoea; when the tinea broke out again she recovered.

17A man of 46 drove out his itch with a sulphur ointment. Thereupon he was seized with inflammation in the chest, with bloody expectoration, dyspnoea and great anguish. The following day the heat and the anguish became almost unbearable and the pains in the chest increased on the third day. Then sweat broke out. After fourteen days the itch broke out again and he felt better. But he had a relapse, the itch dried up again, and he died on the thirteenth day after the relapse.
