<!-- WE EACH EXIST FOR BUT A SHORT TIME. 

In that time explore but a small part of the
whole universe. But humans are a curious species. We wonder, we seek answers. Living in this
vast world that is by turns kind and cruel, and gazing at the immense heavens above, people have
always asked a multitude of questions: How can we understand the world in which we find
ourselves?  -->

How does the universe behave?

What is the nature of reality? 

Where did all this come from? 

Did the universe need a creator? 

<!-- Most of us do not spend most of our time worrying about
these questions, but almost all of us worry about them some of the time.
Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept
up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers
of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.  -->

This book aims to give the answers that are suggested by recent discoveries and theoretical advances. 

<!-- They lead us to a new
picture of the universe and our place in it that is very different from the traditional one, and
different even from the picture we might have painted just a decade or two ago. Still, the first
sketches of the new concept can be traced back almost a century. -->

According to the traditional conception of the universe, objects move on well-defined paths and
have definite histories. 

We can specify their precise position at each moment in time. 

Although that account is successful enough for everyday purposes, it was found in the 1920s that this “classical” picture could not account for the seemingly bizarre behavior observed on the atomic
and subatomic scales of existence. 

Instead it was necessary to adopt a different framework, called quantum physics. 

Quantum theories have been remarkably accurate at predicting events on those scales, while also reproducing the predictions of the old classical theories when applied to the macroscopic world of daily life. But quantum and classical physics are based on very different conceptions of physical reality.

Quantum theories can be formulated in many different ways, but what is probably the most
intuitive description was given by Richard Feynman, a colorful character who worked at
the California Institute of Technology and played the bongo drums at a strip joint down the road.

According to him, a system has not just one history but every possible history. As we seek
our answers, we will explain Feynman’s approach in detail, and employ it to explore the idea that
the universe itself has no single history, nor even an independent existence. That seems like a
radical idea, even to many physicists.

Like many notions in today’s science, it appears to violate common sense. But common sense is based upon everyday experience, not upon the universe as it is revealed through the marvels of technologies such as those that allow us to gaze deep into the atom or back to the early universe.

Until the advent of modern physics it was generally thought that all knowledge of the world could
be obtained through direct observation, that things are what they seem, as perceived through our
senses. But the spectacular success of modern physics, which is based upon concepts such as
Feynman’s that clash with everyday experience, has shown that that is not the case. 

The naive view of reality therefore is not compatible with modern physics. 

To deal with such paradoxes we shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. 

When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. 

If 2 such physical theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather, we are free to use whichever model is
most convenient.
