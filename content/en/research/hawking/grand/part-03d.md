To describe the laws that govern the universe, humans have formulated many theories or models such as:
- the four-element theory
- the Ptolemaic model
- the phlogiston theory
- the big bang theory, etc. 

With each theory or model, our concepts of reality and of the fundamental constituents of the universe have changed. For example, consider the theory of light. 

Newton thought that light was made up of little particles or corpuscles. This would explain why light travels in straight lines, and Newton also used it to explain why light is bent or refracted when it passes from one medium to another, such as from air to glass or air to water.

The corpuscle theory could not, however, be used to explain a phenomenon that Newton himself observed, which is known as Newton’s rings. 

Place a lens on a flat reflecting plate and illuminate it with light of a single color, such as a sodium light. Looking down from above, one will see a
series of light and dark rings centered on where the lens touches the surface. This would be
difficult to explain with the particle theory of light, but it can be accounted for in the wave theory.

According to the wave theory of light, the light and dark rings are caused by a phenomenon called
interference. A wave, such as a water wave, consists of a series of crests and troughs. 

When waves collide, if those crests and troughs happen to correspond, they reinforce each other, yielding a
larger wave. 

That is called constructive interference. In that case the waves are said to be “in phase.” At the other extreme, when the waves meet, the crests of one wave might coincide with the troughs of the other. In that case the waves cancel each other and are said to be “out of phase.”
That situation is called destructive interference.


In Newton’s rings the bright rings are located at distances from the center where the separation between the lens and the reflecting plate is such that the wave reflected from the lens differs from the wave reflected from the plate by an integral (1, 2, 3,…) number of wavelengths, creating constructive interference. (A wavelength is the distance between one crest or trough of a wave and the next.) 

The dark rings, on the other hand, are located at distances from the center where the separation between the two reflected waves is a half-integral (½, 1½, 2½,…) number of wavelengths, causing destructive interference—the wave reflected from the lens cancels the wave reflected from the plate.

In the 19th century, this was taken as confirming the wave theory of light and showing that
the particle theory was wrong.

However, early in the twentieth century Einstein showed that the
photoelectric effect (now used in television and digital cameras) could be explained by a particle
or quantum of light striking an atom and knocking out an electron. Thus light behaves as both
particle and wave.

The concept of waves probably entered human thought because people watched the ocean, or a puddle after a pebble fell into it. In fact, if you have ever dropped two pebbles into a puddle, you have probably seen interference at work, as in the picture above. 

Other liquids were observed to behave in a similar fashion, except perhaps wine if you’ve had too much. The idea of particles was familiar from rocks, pebbles, and sand. 

But this wave/particle duality—the idea that an object could be described as either a particle or a wave—is as foreign to everyday experience as is the idea that you can drink a chunk of sandstone.


Dualities like this—situations in which two very different theories accurately describe the same phenomenon—are consistent with model-dependent realism. Each theory can describe and explain certain properties, and neither theory can be said to be better or more real than the other.
Regarding the laws that govern the universe, what we can say is this: There seems to be no single
mathematical model or theory that can describe every aspect of the universe. 

Instead, there seems to be the network of theories called M-theory. 

Each theory in the M-theory network is good at describing phenomena within a certain range. Wherever their ranges overlap, the various theories in the network agree, so they can all be said to be parts of the same theory. 

But no single theory within the network can describe every aspect of the universe—
all the forces of nature, the particles that feel those forces, and the framework of space and time in
which it all plays out.

Though this situation does not fulfill the traditional physicists’ dream of a single unified theory, it is acceptable within the framework of model-dependent realism. 

We will discuss duality and M-theory further in Chapter 5, but before that we turn to a fundamental principle upon which our modern view of nature is based: quantum theory, and in particular, the approach to quantum theory called alternative histories. 

In that view, the universe does not have just a single existence or history, but rather every possible version of the universe exists simultaneously in what is called a quantum superposition. That may sound as outrageous as the theory in which the table disappears whenever we leave the room, but in this case the theory has passed every experimental test to which it has ever been subjected.
