<!-- The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.

THE UNIVERSE IS COMPREHENSIBLE because it is governed by scientific laws. Its behavior can be modeled. 

But what are these laws or models? 

The first force to be described in mathematical language was gravity. 

Newton’s law of gravity, published in 1687, said that every
object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to its mass. 

It made a great impression on the intellectual life of its era because it showed for the first time that at least one aspect of the universe could be accurately modeled, and it established the mathematical machinery to do so. 

The idea that there are laws of nature brings up issues similar to that for which Galileo had been convicted of heresy about fifty years earlier. For instance, the Bible tells the story of Joshua praying for the sun and moon to stop in their trajectories so he would have extra daylight to finish fighting the Amorites in Canaan. According to the book of Joshua, the sun stood still for about a day.

Today we know that that would have meant that the earth stopped rotating. If the earth stopped, according to Newton’s laws anything not tied down would have remained in motion at the earth’s original speed (1,100 miles per hour at the equator)—a high price to pay for a delayed sunset. None of this bothered Newton himself, for as we’ve said, Newton believed that God could and did intervene in the workings of the universe.

The next aspects of the universe for which a law or model was discovered were the electric and magnetic forces. These behave like gravity, with the important difference that two electric charges or two magnets of the same kind repel each other, while unlike charges or unlike magnets attract.

Electric and magnetic forces are far stronger than gravity, but we don’t usually notice them in everyday life because a macroscopic body contains almost equal numbers of positive and negative electrical charges. This means that the electric and magnetic forces between two macroscopic bodies nearly cancel each other out, unlike the gravitational forces, which all add up.

Our current ideas about electricity and magnetism were developed over a period of about 100 years from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century, when physicists in several countries made detailed experimental studies of electric and magnetic forces. 

One of the most important discoveries was that electrical and magnetic forces are related: A moving electrical
charge causes a force on magnets, and a moving magnet causes a force on electrical charges. 

The first to realize there was some connection was Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. While setting up for a lecture he was to give at the university in 1820, Ørsted noticed that the electric current from the battery he was using deflected a nearby compass needle. He soon realized that moving electricity created a magnetic force, and coined the term “electromagnetism.” 

A few years later, British scientist Michael Faraday reasoned that—expressed in modern terms—if an electric current could cause a magnetic field, a magnetic field should be able to produce an electric current.

He demonstrated that effect in 1831. Fourteen years later Faraday also discovered a connection between electromagnetism and light when he showed that intense magnetism can affect the nature of polarized light.

Faraday had little formal education. He had been born into a poor blacksmith’s family near London and left school at age 13 to work as an errand boy and bookbinder in a bookshop.

There, over the years, he learned science by reading the books he was supposed to care for, and by performing simple and cheap experiments in his spare time. 

Eventually, he obtained work as an assistant in the laboratory of the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy. 

Faraday would stay on for the remaining 45 years of his life. After Davy’s death, he succeed him. 

Faraday had trouble with mathematics and never learned much of it, so it was a struggle for him to conceive a theoretical picture of the odd electromagnetic phenomena he observed in his laboratory. 

Nevertheless, he did.

One of Faraday’s greatest intellectual innovations was the idea of force fields. These days, thanks to books and movies about bug-eyed aliens and their starships, most people are familiar with the term, so maybe he should get a royalty. 

But in the centuries between Newton and Faraday one of the great mysteries of physics was that its laws seemed to indicate that forces act across the empty space that separates interacting objects. Faraday didn’t like that. He believed that to move an object, something has to come in contact with it. And so he imagined the space between electric charges and magnets as being filled with invisible tubes that physically do the pushing and pulling.

Faraday called those tubes a force field. A good way to visualize a force field is to perform the schoolroom demonstration in which a glass plate is placed over a bar magnet and iron filings spread on the glass. With a few taps to overcome friction, the filings move as if nudged by an unseen power and arrange themselves in a pattern of arcs stretching from one pole of the magnet to the other. 

That pattern is a map of the unseen magnetic force that permeates space. 

Today we believe that all forces are transmitted by fields, so it is an important concept in modern physics— as well as science fiction.

For several decades our understanding of electromagnetism remained stalled, amounting to no more than the knowledge of a few empirical laws: the hint that electricity and magnetism were closely, if mysteriously, related; the notion that they had some sort of connection to light; and the embryonic concept of fields. 

At least 11 theories of electromagnetism existed, every one of them flawed.
