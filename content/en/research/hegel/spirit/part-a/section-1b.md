The fundamental difference is that in our perceptions (sense-experience), pure being immediately breaks up into the 2 “thises”:

1. The 'I'
2. The object of the 'I'

<!-- When we reflect(2) on this distinction, neither of them is merely immediate, in sense-certainty. But at the same time, they are mediated.

I have the certainty through the other [object of the I] through the actual fact. 

This, again, exists in that certainty through an other, as the 'I'. -->


{{< s v="93" >}} 

This is the distinction between:
- essential truth and particular example
- essence and instance
- immediacy and mediation. 

We find this in our perception (sense-certainty) itself. It has to be taken up in the form in which it exists there, not as we have just determined it. 
- One of them is put forward in it as existing in simple immediacy, as the essential reality, the object. 
- The other, however, is put forward as the non-essential, as mediated, something which is not per se in the certainty. 

But there, through something else, ego, a state of knowledge which only knows the object because the object is, and which can as well be as not be.

The object, however, is the real truth, is the essential reality. It is, quite indifferent to whether it is known or not. It remains and stands even though it is not known, while the knowledge does not exist if the object is not there.


{{< s v="94" >}} Thus, we have to consider whether the object exists in perception (sense-certainty) itself.

 <!-- as such an essential reality as that certainty gives it out to be; whether its meaning and notion, which is to be essential reality, corresponds to the way it is present in that certainty.  -->

To do this, we do not need to reflect about it and ponder what it might be in truth. Instead, we deal with it merely as the perception  <!-- sense-certainty  --> contains it.



{{< s v="95" >}} What is the This or perception? 

<!-- the Sense-certainty -->

It exists in a two-fold form* as:
- the Now
- the Here

{{< n n="From starting with the aethereal consciousness, Hegel's reasoning goes to the spacetime 'here' and 'now'." >}}

Its dialectic will take a form as intelligible as the This-perception itself.

What is the Now?
- The Now is night-time, for example. 

To test the truth of this perception (sense-certainty), a simple experiment is all we need: **write that truth down**. 
- A truth cannot lose anything by being written down, and just as little by our preserving and keeping it. 
- We then look at the truth we have written down now, at this noon-time. 

We say it has turned stale and become out of date.


{{< s v="96" >}} But the Now that was night is kept fixed.
- The night-Now is still the night-Now, but not the noon-Now.
- The noon-Now maintains itself. 
<!-- , i.e. it is treated as what it is given out to be, as something which is; but it proves to be rather a something which is not.  -->
- The Now-idea maintains itself, but is no longer the night-Now-perception.
<!-- - Similarly in its relation to the day which the Now is at present, it maintains itself as something that is also not day, or as altogether something negative.  -->

This self-maintaining Now is therefore not something immediate but something mediated. 

<!-- ; for, qua something that remains and preserves itself, it is determined through and by means of the fact that something else, namely day and night, is not. -->

- By this mediation, the Now-idea is indifferent to what is associated with it.
  - Now has both day and night as its being. 
<!-- ; just as little as night or day is its being, it is just as truly also day and night; i -->
  - It is not at all affected by this otherness, as either night or day
  <!-- , through which it is what it is.  -->

{{< n n="Because of spacetime, perceptions are now split into Universal and Instances of the Universal. This matches David Hume's entity within an entity or citizens within a Republic." >}}


A 'Universal Idea' is a simple entity of this sort. 
- Through negation, it is neither this nor that. 

<!-- , which is a not-this, and with equal indifference this as well as that – a thing of this kind we call .  -->

A Universal Idea is therefore the truth of perception (sense-certainty), the true content of sense-experience.

<!-- A Universal is therefore the truth of sense-certainty. -->

{{< s v="97" >}} Sensuous fact is also a Universal. 

 <!-- too, that we(3) give utterance to .  -->

Therefore:
- when we say “this”, we mean a universal this. 
- when we say “It is”, we mean being in general. 


Of course, we do not philosophize about the universal "this" when we say it. Instead, we utter what is universal without thinking about it being a Universal.

<!--  present before our mind in saying, so the universal this, or being in general, but we ; 

In other words, we do not actually and absolutely say what in this sense-certainty we really mean.  -->

<!-- Language, however, is the more truthful. 

In it we ourselves refute directly and at once our own “meaning”; and since universality is the real truth of sense-certainty, and language merely expresses this truth, it is not possible at all for us even to express in words any sensuous existence which we “mean”. -->
