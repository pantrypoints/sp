# Sense Certainty
description: This certainty wholly refuses to come out if we direct its attention to a Now that is night, or an I to whom it is night. We will go to it and let ourselves point out the Now that is asserted.

<sup>109</sup> Thus, the dialectic process involved in perception (sense-certainty) is merely the history of its process – of its experience.
- Perception itself is nothing else than this history. 
<!-- ; and sense-certainty -->

This is why the naïve consciousness is of itself always coming to this result, which is the real truth in this case. 
- Consciousness always has an experience of it.
- But it is always forgetting it again and beginning the process all over. 

But people do not do this dialectical analysis and so have no knowledge of this process.
- This is why people announce perception as “universal experience”
- They even enshrine sense-perception as a philosophical doctrine that is called "skepticism"

This is astonishing. 

Skepticism says that the reality or being of external things in the sense of “Thises”, particular sense objects, has absolute validity and truth for consciousness.



<!-- Therefore, it is astonishing when, in defiance of this experience, it is  -->
 

- One who makes such an assertion really does not know what he is saying
- One does not know that he is stating the opposite of what he wants to say. 

The truth for consciousness of a “This” of sense is said to be universal experience. 
- But the very opposite is universal experience. 

Every consciousness of itself cancels again, as soon as made, such a truth as e.g. the Here is a tree, or the Now is noon, and expresses the very opposite: the Here is not a tree but a house.

Similarly, it straightway cancels again the assertion which here annuls the first, which is also just such an assertion of a sensuous This.

In all perceptions (sense-certainty) what we find by experience is in truth merely, as we have seen, that “This” is a universal, the very opposite of what that assertion maintained to be universal experience.

We may be permitted here, in this appeal to universal experience, to anticipate(5) with a reference to the practical sphere. 

<!-- In this connection we may answer those who thus -->

Some philosophers insist on the truth and certainty of the reality of objects of sense.

They say that:
- they had better be sent back to the most elementary school of wisdom -- the ancient Eleusinian mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus
- they have not yet learnt the inner secret of the eating of bread and the drinking of wine. 

Any person initiated into these mysteries not only comes to doubt the being of things of sense. 
- He also gets into a state of despair about it altogether.
- In dealing with them, he:
  - partly brings about the nothingness of those things
  - partly sees these bring about their own nothingness. 

Even animals are not shut off from this wisdom.
- Animals show they are deeply initiated into it.
- They do not stand still before things of sense as if these had being in themselves.
- They despair of this reality.
- They are complete assured of the nothingness of things they fall to without more ado and eat them up. 

All of nature proclaims, as animals do, these open secrets.
- Nature reveals these mysteries revealed to all, which teach what the truth of things of sense is.

<!-- Φ 110.  -->

<!-- Those who put forward such assertions really themselves say, if we bear in mind what we remarked before, the direct opposite of what they mean: a fact which is perhaps best able to bring them to reflect on the nature of the certainty of sense-experience.  -->


<sup>110</sup>> Those philosophers who insist on the reality of objects of sense speak of the “existence” of external objects.
- They say that this is the existence which has absolute certainty and truth.

<!-- , which can be more precisely characterized as actual, absolutely particular, wholly personal, individual things, each of them not like anything or anyone else; .  -->

For example, they assign a continuous existence to the paper I am writing on. 
- But this continuous existence is really only created by consciousness. 
- The moment they speak that the paper is universally existing, such existence disappears at that very moment. 
  - This is because they would have been ascribing existence to the paper from the previous moment and not the current moment. 

Therefore the continued existence of anything is unspeakable. 
- Consequently, it is is untrue, irrational, something simply uttered without any real meaning.

<!-- They “mean” this bit of paper I am writing on, or rather have written on: but they do not say what they “mean”. 

If they really wanted to say this bit of paper which they “mean”, and they wanted to say so, that is impossible, because the This of sense, which is “meant”, cannot be reached by language, which , i.e. to what is inherently universal. 

In the very attempt to say it, it would crumble in their hands. 

Those who have begun to describe it would not be able to finish doing so. 

They would have to hand it over to others, who would themselves in the last resort have to confess to speaking about a thing that has no being. 

They mean, then, doubtless this bit of paper here, which is quite different from that bit over there. But they speak of actual things, external or sensible objects, absolutely individual, real, and so on. That is, they say about them what is simply universal.  -->

Speaking about the existence of a thing is really just to say that it existed at that time. It is this existence-at-a-time which is universal, and not the object. 
- We then express the object's identity and its likeness to the other objects that have the attribute of existence, rather than its difference from everything else

<!-- If nothing is said of a thing except that it is an actual thing, an external object, this only makes it the most universal of all possible things, and thereby we express its likeness, its identity, with everything, rather than its difference from everything else.  -->

<!-- When I say “an individual thing”, I at once state it to be really quite a universal, for  -->

Everything is an individual thing.
- Such things have an attribute of existence.
- This existence makes it universal.  

In the same way, “this thing” is everything and anything we like that is existing. 
- For example, this paper is a universal paper just like any other paper.

<!-- More precisely, as this bit of paper, each and every paper is a “this bit of paper”, and I have thus said all the while what is universal. -->

<!-- If I want, however, to help out speech – which has the divine nature of directly turning the mere “meaning” right round about, making it into something else, and so not letting it ever come the length of words at all – by pointing out this bit of paper, then I get the experience of what is, in point of fact, the real truth of sense-certainty.  -->

I point out the paper as a Here.
- This Here is a Here of other Heres, a Here that is simply many Heres together, i.e. is a universal. 

<!-- I take it up then, as in truth it is; and instead of knowing something immediate, I “take” something “truly”, I per-ceive (wahrnehme, per-cipio). -->
