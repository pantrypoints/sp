## Ancient Egypt

From old Egypt have come the fundamental esoteric and occult teachings which have so strongly influenced the philosophies of all peoples for several thousand years. 

Egypt, the home of the Pyramids and the Sphinx, was the birthplace of the Hidden Wisdom and Mystic Teachings.  

All nations have borrowed from her Secret Doctrine. 

The following ancient countries liberally ate at the feast of knowledge which the Hierophants and Masters of Egypt so freely provided:
- India
- Persia
- Chaldea
- Medea
- China
- Japan
- Assyria
- Greece and Rome
- etc

<!--  for those who came prepared to partake of the great store of Mystic and Occult Lore which the masterminds of that ancient land had gathered together -->.


Since the days of Hermes, ancient Egypt had the great Adepts and Masters who have:
- never been surpassed
- seldom have been equaled

<!-- , during the centuries that have taken their processional flight .  -->

Egypt had the Great Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. Her Temples accepted the Neophytes who later became Hierophants, Adepts, and Masters. 

<!-- They traveled to the world bringing precious knowledge willing to pass on to those who were ready to receive them.  -->

All students of the Occult recognize the debt that they owe to these venerable Masters of that ancient land.

<!-- But among these great Masters of Ancient Egypt there once dwelt one of whom Masters hailed as "The ." This man, if "man" indeed he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest days.  -->

The Master of Masters was Hermes Trismegistus who lived in Egypt. He was:
- the father of the Occult Wisdom
- the founder of Astrology
- the discoverer of Alchemy. 

The details of his life story are lost to history.

<!-- , owing to the lapse of the years, though several of the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the honor of having furnished his birthplace—and this thousands of years ago.  -->

The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on this planet, is not now known. But it has been fixed at the early days of the oldest dynasties of Egypt—long before the days of Moses. 

The best authorities call him as a contemporary of Abraham. Some Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham learned mysticism from Hermes.

<!-- As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of life (tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in the flesh), --> The Egyptians deified Hermes <!-- , and made him one of their gods, --> under the name of Thoth. Years after, the Ancient Greeks also made him one of their man gods as "Hermes, the god of Wisdom".

The Egyptians revered his memory for tens of centuries, calling him "the Scribe of the Gods", giving his ancient title "Trismegistus" which means:
- "the thrice-great"
- "the great-great"
- "the greatest-great" etc. 

In all the ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name being synonymous with the "Fount of Wisdom."

Even to this day, we use the term "hermetic" in the sense of:
- secret
- sealed so that nothing can escape, etc.

This is because his followers always observed secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in "casting pearls before swine," but rather held to the teaching:
- "milk for babes"
- "meat for strong men" 

Those 2 maxims are used in the Christian scriptures but have been used by the Egyptians for centuries. This policy of careful dissemination of the truth has always characterized the Hermetics, even today. 

The Hermetic Teachings can be found in all lands, in all religions, but never identified with any particular country, nor with any religion. 

This because of the warning of the ancient teachers against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of history. 

The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated and was largely lost because the teachers became priests and mixed theology with philosophy. This caused occultism to be lost amidst religious superstition, cults, creeds and "gods". 

This was also true with:
- Ancient Greece and Rome
- the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and Early Christians, which were lost at the time of Constantine

<!-- , whose iron hand smothered philosophy with the blanket of theology, losing to the Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the way back to its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get back to its ancient mystic teachings. -->

But there were always a few faithful and fearless souls who kept alive the Flame, tending it carefully, and not allowing its light to become extinguished. Thanks to them, we have the truth still with us. 

<!-- But it is not found in books, to any great extent.  -->It has been passed along from Master to Student. <!-- ; from Initiate to Hierophant; from lip to ear. --> 

When it was written down, its meaning was veiled in terms of alchemy and astrology so that only those with the key could read it. This was to avoid the persecutions of Church <!-- the theologians of the Middle Ages, --> who fought the Secret Doctrine with fire and sword<!-- ; stake, gibbet and cross -->. 

Even today, there are only a few reliable books on Hermetic Philosophy, although there are many references to it in books on Occultism. 

The Hermetic Philosophy is the only Master Key which will open all the doors of the Occult Teachings!

In the early days, the Basic Hermetic Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, was compiled into as "THE KYBALION". <!--  the exact significance and meaning of the term having been lost for several centuries.  -->

<!-- This teaching, however, is known to many to whom it has descended, from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the centuries.  -->

<!-- Its precepts have never been written down, or printed, so far as we know.  -->

It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts, which were only understandable to  students. <!-- , after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes.  -->

These formed the basic principles of "The Art of Hermetic Alchemy" which dealt in the mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements.

It was the Transmutation of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of the changing of one kind of metal into another. 

The legends of the "Philosopher's Stone" which would turn base metal into Gold, was an allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy.

<!-- , readily understood by all students of true Hermeticism -->

<!-- In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite our students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as set forth in THE KYBALION, and as explained by ourselves, humble students of the Teachings, who, while bearing the title of Initiates, are still students at the feet of HERMES, the Master. We herein give you many of the maxims, axioms and precepts of THE KYBALION, accompanied by explanations and illustrations which we deem likely to render the teachings more easily comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the original text is purposely veiled in obscure terms. -->

<!-- The original maxims, axioms, and precepts of THE KYBALION are printed herein, in italics, the proper credit being given.  -->

<!-- Our own work is printed in the regular way, in the body of the work. We trust that the many students to whom we now offer this little work will derive as much benefit from the study of its pages as have the many who have gone on before, treading the same Path to Mastery throughout the centuries that have passed since the times of HERMES TRISMEGISTUS—the Master of Masters—the Great-Great.  -->


<!--     "Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those
    ready for his Teaching open wide."—The Kybalion.

    "When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh
    the lips to fill them with Wisdom."—The Kybalion.


So that according to the Teachings, the passage of this book to those ready for the instruction will attract the attention of such as are prepared to receive the Teaching. And, likewise, when the pupil is ready to receive the truth, then will this little book come to him, or her. Such is The Law. The Hermetic Principle of Cause and Effect, in its aspect of The Law of Attraction, will bring lips and ear together—pupil and book in company.
