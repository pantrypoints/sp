The Universe is Mental—held in the Mind of THE ALL
{{< /q >}}


THE ALL is SPIRIT! But what is Spirit? 

<!-- This question cannot be answered, for the reason that its definition is practically that of  -->

THE ALL cannot be explained or defined. Spirit is the highest conception of Infinite Living Mind. It means:
- "the Real Essence"
- Living Mind, much superior to Life and Mind as we know them, just as the latter are superior to mechanical Energy and Matter. 

Spirit transcends our understanding. We use the term "Spirit" so we can think of THE ALL.*

{{< n n="The author's defintion of Spirit is the same as Deity. So it is still unscientific." >}}

<!-- For the purposes of thought and understanding, we are justified in  -->

We think of Spirit as Infinite Living Mind. We acknowledge that we cannot fully understand it. 

We must either do this or stop thinking of the matter at all.


## What is the Universe? 

Nothing can be outside of THE ALL. Then is the Universe THE ALL? 

No, because the Universe:
- seems to be made up of MANY
- is constantly changing
- does not measure up to the ideas that match THE ALL

If the Universe is not THE ALL, then it must be Nothing. But this is incorrect since we are sensible of the existence of the Universe. 

If the Universe is neither THE ALL, nor Nothing, what Can it be?

If the Universe<!--  exists at all, or seems to exist, it must proceed in some way from THE ALL—it must be --> is a creation of THE ALL. But something can never come from nothing, from what could THE ALL have created it?

Some philosophers say that THE ALL created the Universe from ITSELF*. But this will not do, because:
- THE ALL cannot be subtracted from, nor divided
- each particle in the Universe would be aware of its being THE ALL since THE ALL could not lose its knowledge of itself, nor actually BECOME an atom, or blind force, or lowly living thing.


{{< n n="This is the answer of Buddhism and Hinduism which Superphysics adopts. This leads to the two forces of Yin-Yang" >}}


Some people realize this and shout <!--  men, indeed, realizing that THE ALL is indeed ALL, and also recognizing that they, the men, existed, have jumped to the conclusion that they and THE ALL were identical, and they have filled the air with shouts of --> "I AM GOD," to the amusement of sages. It would be similar to an object saying: "I am Man!"

So what is the Universe?

<!-- , if it be not THE ALL, not yet created by THE ALL having separated itself into fragments? What else can it be— of what else can it be made? This is the great question. Let us examine it carefully. We find here that  -->

The "Principle of Correspondence" which says "As above so below" will answer this. <!--  may be pressed into service at this point. Let us endeavor to get a glimpse of the workings on higher planes by examining those on our own. The Principle of Correspondence must apply to this as well as to other problems. -->

1. On his own plane of being, Man creates by making something out of outside materials. 

But this will not do, for there are no materials outside of THE ALL. 

2. Man reproduces his kind by the process of begetting.

This is self-multiplication accomplished by transferring a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer or subtract a portion of itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself.

In the first place there would be a taking away, and in the second case a multiplication or addition to THE ALL, both thoughts being an absurdity. 


The correct answer is that Man creates MENTALLY! He uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation*.

{{< n n="This answer is from the perspective of the Absolute. It implies that the universe is an illusion, similar to Vedanta philosophy. Superphysics rejects this as ours is a problem-solving framework for the real world. And so it has to accept the reality of existence and its effects in order to solve them. The effect of Kybalion Philosophy is to imagine the problem to go away. This is similar to how Vedanta 'solves' problems by ignoring them. Too much materialism is bad. But too much mentalism is bad too." >}}


Following the Principle of Correspondence, THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY just as how Man creates Mental Images. <!-- And, here is where the report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the Wise Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes. -->

THE ALL can create in no other way except mentally, without either using material (and there is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which is also impossible). 

There is no escape from this conclusion of the Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the highest teachings of the Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality. 

But your Universe is the mental creation of a Finite Mind, whereas that of THE ALL is the creation of an Infinite. The two are similar in kind, but infinitely different in degree. We shall examine more closely into the process of creation and manifestation as we proceed. 

**THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL CREATION OF THE ALL. Verily indeed, ALL IS MIND!**


{{< q c="The Kybalion" >}}
THE ALL creates in its Infinite Mind countless Universes, which exist for aeons of Time. Yet, to THE ALL, the creation, development, decline and death of a million Universes is as the time of the twinkling of an eye.

The Principle of Gender* is manifested on all planes of life, material mental and spiritual. But, as we have said before, "Gender" does not mean "Sex" sex is merely a material manifestation of gender. "Gender" means "relating to generation or creation". 

{{< n n="The author is unable to say where the Principle of Gender comes from. In Superphysics, it comes from Yin-Yang as the 2 forces that divide the One into the All. The author merely says that the Principle of Gender exists" >}}



Whenever anything is generated or created, on any plane, the Principle of Gender must be manifested. And this is true even in the creation of Universes.

This does not mean that there is a male and female God or Creator. <!-- That idea is merely a distortion of the ancient teachings on the subject. The true teaching is that --> THE ALL is above Gender, as it is above every other Law, including those of Time and Space. <!-- It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is not subject to them.  -->

But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of generation or creation, then it acts according to Law and Principle, for it is moving on a lower plane of Being. Consequently it manifests the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the Mental Plane.

<!-- This idea may seem startling to some of you who hear it for the first time, but you have all really passively accepted it in your everyday conceptions.  -->

People speak of:
- the Fatherhood of God, the Divine Father
- the Motherhood of Nature

<!-- But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality—THE ALL is ONE—the Two Aspects are merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching is that  -->

The Masculine Principle is separate from the actual mental creation of the Universe. 
- It projects its Will toward the Feminine Principle (called "Nature")
- The Feminine Principle does the actual work of the evolution of the Universe

<!-- , from simple "centers of activity" on to man, and then on and on still higher, all according to well-established and firmly enforced Laws of Nature.  -->

If you prefer the old figures of thought, you may think of the 

- The Masculine Principle can be thought of as GOD, the Father
- The Feminine Principle is NATURE, the Universal Mother, from whose womb all things have been born. 

<!-- This is more than a mere poetic figure of speech—it is an idea of the actual process of the creation of the Universe. But always remember, that THE ALL is but One, and that in its Infinite Mind the Universe is generated, created and exists. -->

<!-- It may help you to get the proper idea, if you will apply  to yourself, and your own mind. You know that t -->


## I Versus Me

You can apply the Law of Correspondence to yourself. The part of You which you call "I," stands apart and witnesses the creation of mental Images in your own mind. 

The part of your mind in which the mental generation is accomplished may be called the "Me" in distinction from the "I" which stands apart and witnesses and examines the thoughts, ideas and images of the "Me." <!-- "As above, so below," remember, and the phenomena of one plane may be employed to solve the riddles of higher or lower planes. -->

We feel that instinctive reverence, as "religion", for THE ALL. Religion is really a reverence for THE FATHER MIND? 

<!-- When you consider the works and wonders of Nature, you are overcome with a mighty feeling which has its roots away down in your inmost being? It is the MOTHER MIND that you are pressing close up to, like a babe to the breast. -->

<!-- Do not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see around you—the Earth, which is a mere grain of dust in the Universe—is the Universe itself.  -->

There are millions upon millions of worlds and such Universes within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL. 

<!-- Even in our own little solar system, there are regions and planes of life far higher than ours, and beings compared to which we earth-bound mortals are as the slimy life-forms that dwell on the ocean's bed when compared to Man. There are beings with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever dreamed of the gods' possessing.

And yet these beings were once as you, and still lower—and you will be even as they, and still higher, in time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined. -->

Death is not real, even in the Relative sense. It is but Birth to a new life. You shall go on and on to higher and still higher planes of life, for aeons of time. 

<!-- The Universe is your home, and you shall explore its farthest recesses before the end of Time. You are dwelling in the Infinite Mind of THE ALL, and your possibilities and opportunities are infinite, both in time and space.
 -->
At the end of the Grand Cycle of Aeons, when THE ALL shall draw back into itself all of its creations. <!-- —you will go gladly for you will then be able to know the Whole Truth of being At One with THE ALL. Such is the report of the Illumined—those who have advanced well along The Path. -->

<!-- Rest calm and serene for you are safe and protected by the Infinite Power of the FATHER-MOTHER MIND.
