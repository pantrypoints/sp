<!-- We take great pleasure in presenting to the attention of students and investigators of the Secret Doctrines this little work based upon the world-old  There has been  -->

So little written on the Hermetic Teachings. 

<!-- not withstanding the countless references to the Teachings in the many works upon occultism, that the many earnest searchers after the Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the appearance of this present volume. -->

This work does not aim to explain any special doctrine, but to give a statement of the Truth that will reconcile the bits of occult knowledge that they may have acquired. Such bits are:
- apparently opposed to each other
- discourage and disgust the beginner. 

Our intent is not to erect a new Temple of Knowledge, but to give a Master-Key to open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery.
 <!-- through the main portals he has already entered. -->

<!-- There is no portion of

The fragments of the Hermetic Teachings have come down to us over the tens of centuries since the lifetime of its great founder, 
- These are the portion of the occult teachings which have been closely guarded the most.

Hermes Trismegistus was the "scribe of the gods". 
- He lived in old Egypt during the time of Abraham, if the legends be true, an instructor of Abraham. 
- Hermes was, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism. 

<!-- , whose rays have served to illumine the countless teachings which have been promulgated since his time. --> 

All the fundamental and basic teachings embedded in the esoteric teachings of every race may be traced back to Hermes.
- Even the most ancient teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the original Hermetic Teachings.


Many advanced occultists from India wandered into Egypt, and sat with Hermes, getting the Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views. 


Thus, the Secret Doctrine was firmly established. 

From other lands also came the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master of Masters.
- His influence was so great that in spite of the many wanderings from the path by foreign teachers throughout the centuries, they still have some basic resemblance.
  <!-- and correspondence which underlies the many and often quite divergent theories entertained and taught by the occultists of these different lands today.  -->

The student of Comparative Religions can perceive the influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every notable religion.
- They always have certain correspondence despite having contradictory features.
- The Hermetic Teachings are their Great Reconciler.

 <!-- worthy of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion or one in full vigor in our own times. There is  -->

Hermes's life work was to plant the great Seed-Truth instead of establishing a school of philosophy which would dominate the world's thought.
- This seed has grown and blossomed in so many strange forms.  

Nevertheless, his original truths have been kept intact in their original purity by a few men of each age,
- Such men refuse great numbers of half-developed students.
- They followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their truth for the few who were ready to comprehend and master it.


There have always been a few Initiates in each generation who kept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings. 

<!-- These men devoted their lives to the labor of love: -->

<!-- and such have always been willing to use their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of the outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded by reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign matter. 

 There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the Truth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom.  which the poet has so well stated in his lines: -->

"O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age in its dark cavern—in its holy temples cherished. Fed by pure ministers of love—let not the flame die out!"

These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers. 

<!-- They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in each generation who are ready for the truth, or who would recognize it if it were presented to them. They reserve the "strong meat for men," while others furnish the "milk for babes."  -->

<!-- They reserve their pearls of wisdom for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in their crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar swine, who would trample them in the mud and mix them with their disgusting mental food. 

But still these men have never forgotten or overlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of the words of truth to those ready to receive it, which teaching is stated in The Kybalion as follows: "Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide."

"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to fill them with wisdom." 

But their customary attitude has always been strictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The Kybalion: "The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding." -->

There are those who have criticized this attitude of the Hermetists. They have claimed that they did not manifest the proper spirit in their policy of seclusion and reticence.

But these show the wisdom of the Masters, who knew the folly of teaching to the world that which it was neither ready or willing to receive.

The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs.

They have, instead, sat silently aside while the "heathen raged noisily about them" in their customary amusement of putting to death and torture the honest but misguided enthusiasts who imagined that they could force upon barbarians the truth.

 <!-- capable of being understood only by the elect who had advanced along The Path. -->

<!-- The spirit of persecution has not as yet died out in the land.  -->

There are certain Hermetic Teachings, which, if publicly promulgated, would bring scorn on the teachers.

 <!-- a great cry of scorn and revilement from the multitude, who would again raise the cry of "Crucify! Crucify." -->

<!-- In this little work we have endeavored to give you an idea of the fundamental teachings of The Kybalion, striving to give you the working Principles, leaving you to apply therm yourselves, rather than attempting to work out the teaching in detail. If you are a true student, you will be able to work out and apply these Principles—if not, then you must develop yourself into one, for otherwise the Hermetic Teachings will be as "words, words, words" to you. -->
