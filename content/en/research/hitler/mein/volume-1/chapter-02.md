WHEN MY mother died, my fate had already been decided in one respect. 

During the last months of her illness I went to Vienna to take the entrance examination for the Academy of Fine Arts. 

Armed with a bulky packet of sketches, I felt convinced that I could pass the examination easily. 

At the REALSCHULE, I was by far the best student in the drawing class. Since then, I had made more than ordinary
progress in the practice of drawing. 

<!-- Therefore I was pleased with myself and was proud and happy at the prospect of what I considered an assured success.
But there was one misgiving:  -->

It seemed to me that I was better at drawing than at painting, especially in the various branches of architectural drawing. At the same time my interest in architecture was constantly increasing.

I advanced in this direction faster after my first visit to Vienna, which lasted 2 weeks. I was not yet 16 years old.

I went to the Hof Museum to study the paintings in the art gallery there; but the building itself captured almost all my interest, from early morning until late at night I spent all my time visiting the various public buildings. 

The buildings were always the principal attraction for me. For hours and hours I could stand in wonderment before the Opera and the Parliament. 
 
The whole Ring Strasse had a magic effect upon me, as if it were a scene from the Thousandand-one-Nights.

<!-- And now I was here for the second time in this beautiful city, impatiently waiting to
hear the result of the entrance examination but proudly confident that I had got
through. I was so convinced of my success that when the news that I had failed to pass
was brought to me it struck me like a bolt from the skies. Yet the fact was that  -->


I got news that I had failed. I asked the Rectorwhy they refused to accept me as a student in the general School of Painting, which was part of the Academy. 

He said that my sketches unquestionably showed that painting was not what I was suited for but that the same sketches gave
clear indications of my aptitude for architectural designing. 

Therefore the School of Painting did not come into question for me but rather the School of Architecture, which also formed part of the Academy. 

I had never been to a school for architecture and had never received any instruction in architectural designing. 

<!-- When I left the Hansen Palace, on the SCHILLER PLATZ, I was quite crestfallen. I felt
out of sorts with myself for the first time in my young life. For what I had heard about
my capabilities now appeared to me as a lightning flash which clearly revealed a
dualism under which I had been suffering for a long time, but hitherto I could give no
clear account whatsoever of the why and wherefore. -->

I knew that I should become an architect. But of course the way was very difficult. 

I was now forced bitterly to rue my former conduct in neglecting and despising certain subjects at the REALSCHULE. 

Before taking up the courses at the School of Architecture in the Academy it was necessary to attend the Technical Building School. 

But a necessary qualification for entrance was a Leaving Certificate from the Middle School which I simply did not have.

<!-- According to the human measure of things my dream of following an artistic calling
seemed beyond the limits of possibility.

After the death of my mother I came to Vienna for the third time. This visit was
destined to last several years. Since I had been there before I had recovered my old calm
and resoluteness. The former self-assurance had come back, and I had my eyes steadily
fixed on the goal. I would be an architect. Obstacles are placed across our path in life,
not to be boggled at but to be surmounted.  -->

I was fully determined to surmount these obstacles, having the picture of my father constantly before my mind, who had raised himself by his own efforts to the position of a civil servant though he was the poor son of a village shoemaker. 

I had a better start, and the possibilities of struggling through were better. At that time my lot in life seemed to me a harsh one; but to-day I see in it the wise workings of Providence. 

The Goddess of Fate clutched me in her hands and often threatened to smash me; but the will grew stronger as the obstacles
increased, and finally the will triumphed.

I am thankful for that period of my life, because it hardened me and enabled me to be as tough as I now am. And I am even more thankful because I appreciate the fact that I was thus saved from the emptiness of a life of ease and that a mother's darling was taken from tender arms and handed over to Adversity as to a new mother. Though I then rebelled against it as too hard a fate, I am grateful that I was thrown into a world of misery and poverty and thus came to know the people for whom I was afterwards to fight.

It was during this period that my eyes were opened to two perils, the names of which I scarcely knew hitherto and had no notion whatsoever of their terrible significance for the existence of the German people. These two perils were Marxism and Judaism. 

For many people the name of Vienna signifies innocent jollity, a festive place for happy mortals. For me, alas, it is a living memory of the saddest period in my life. Even to-day  the mention of that city arouses only gloomy thoughts in my mind. 

Five years of poverty in that Phaecian (Note 5) town. Five years in which, first as a casual labourer and then as a painter of little trifles, I had to earn my daily bread. And a meagre morsel indeed it was, not even sufficient to still the hunger which I constantly felt. 

That hunger was the faithful guardian which never left me but took part in everything I did. Every book that I bought meant renewed hunger, and every visit I paid to the opera meant the intrusion of that inalienabl companion during the following days. 

I was always struggling with my unsympathic friend. And yet during that time I learned more than I had ever learned before. Outside my architectural studies and rare visits to the opera, for which I had to deny myself food, I had no other pleasure in life except my books. 

I read a great deal then, and I pondered deeply over what I read. All the free time after work was devoted exclusively to study. Thus within a few years I was able to acquire a stock of knowledge which I find useful even to-day.

But more than that. During those years a view of life and a definite outlook on the world took shape in my mind. These became the granite basis of my conduct at that time. Since then I have extended that foundation only very little, and I have changed nothing in it.

On the contrary: I am firmly convinced to-day that, generally speaking, it is in youth that men lay the essential groundwork of their creative thought, wherever that creative thought exists. I make a distinction between the wisdom of age--which can only arise from the greater profundity and foresight that are based on the experiences of a long life--and the creative genius of youth, which blossoms out in thought and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, without being able to put these into practice immediately, because of their very superabundance. 

These furnish the building materials and plans for the future; and it is from them that age takes the stones and builds the edifice, unless the so-called wisdom of the years may have smothered the creative genius of youth.

The life which I had hitherto led at home with my parents differed in little or nothing from that of all the others. I looked forward without apprehension to the morrow, and there was no such thing as a social problem to be faced. Those among whom I passed my young days belonged to the small bourgeois class. 

Therefore it was a world that had very little contact with the world of genuine manual labourers. For, though at first this may appear astonishing, the ditch which separates that class, which is by no means economically well-off; from the manual labouring class is often deeper than people think. 

The reason for this division, which we may almost call enmity, lies in the fear that dominates a social group which has only just risen above the level of the manual labourer--a fear lest it may fall back into its old condition or at least be classed with the labourers. 

Moreover, there is something repulsive in remembering the cultural indigence of that lower class and their rough manners with one another; so that people who are only on the first rung of the social ladder find it unbearable to be forced to have  any contact with the cultural level and standard of living out of which they have passed.

And so it happens that very often those who belong to what can really be called the upper classes find it much easier than do the upstarts to descend to and intermingle with their fellow beings on the lowest social level. For by the word upstart I mean everyone who has raised himself through his own efforts to a social level higher than
that to which he formerly belonged. 

In the case of such a person the hard struggle through which he passes often destroys his normal human sympathy. His own fight for existence kills his sensibility for the misery of those who have been left behind.

From this point of view fate had been kind to me. Circumstances forced me to return to that world of poverty and economic insecurity above which my father had raised himself in his early days; and thus the blinkers of a narrow PETIT BOURGEOIS education were torn from my eyes. 

Now for the first time I learned to know men and I learned to distinguish between empty appearances or brutal manners and the real inner nature of the people who outwardly appeared thus.

At the beginning of the century Vienna had already taken rank among those cities where social conditions are iniquitous. Dazzling riches and loathsome destitution were intermingled in violent contrast. 

In the centre and in the Inner City one felt the pulsebeat of an Empire which had a population of fifty-two millions, with all the perilous charm of a State made up of multiple nationalities. 

The dazzling splendour of the Court acted like a magnet on the wealth and intelligence of the whole Empire. And this attraction was further strengthened by the dynastic policy of the Habsburg Monarchy in centralizing everything in itself and for itself.

This centralizing policy was necessary in order to hold together that hotchpotch of heterogeneous nationalities. But the result of it was an extraordinary concentration of higher officials in the city, which was at one and the same time the metropolis and imperial residence.

But Vienna was not merely the political and intellectual centre of the Danubian Monarchy; it was also the commercial centre. Besides the horde of military officers of high rank, State officials, artists and scientists, there was the still vaster horde of workers. 

Abject poverty confronted the wealth of the aristocracy and the merchant class face to face. Thousands of unemployed loitered in front of the palaces on the Ring Strasse; and below that VIA TRIUMPHALIS of the old Austria the homeless huddled together in the murk and filth of the canals.

There was hardly any other German city in which the social problem could be studied better than in Vienna. But here I must utter a warning against the illusion that this problem can be 'studied' from above downwards. The man who has never been in the clutches of that crushing viper can never know what its poison is. An attempt to study it in any other way will result only in superficial talk and sentimental delusions. Both are harmful.

The first because it can never go to the root of the question, the second because it evades the question entirely. I do not know which is the more nefarious: to ignore social distress, as do the majority of those who have been favoured by fortune and those who have risen in the social scale through their own routine labour, or the equally supercilious and often tactless but always genteel condescension displayed by people who make a fad of being charitable and who plume themselves on 'sympathising with the people.' 

Of course such persons sin more than they can imagine from lack of instinctive understanding. And thus they are astonished to find that the 'social conscience' on which they pride themselves never produces any results, but often causes their good intentions to be resented; and then they talk of the ingratitude of the people.

Such persons are slow to learn that here there is no place for merely social activities and that there can be no expectation of gratitude; for in this connection there is no question at all of distributing favours but essentially a matter of retributive justice. I was protected against the temptation to study the social question in the way just mentioned, for the simple reason that I was forced to live in the midst of poverty-stricken people.

Therefore it was not a question of studying the problem objectively, but rather one of testing its effects on myself. Though the rabbit came through the ordeal of the experiment, this must not be taken as evidence of its harmlessness.

When I try to-day to recall the succession of impressions received during that time I find that I can do so only with approximate completeness. Here I shall describe only the more essential impressions and those which personally affected me and often staggered me. 

And I shall mention the few lessons I then learned from this experience.
