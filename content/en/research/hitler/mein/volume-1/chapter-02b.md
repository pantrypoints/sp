At that time it was for the most part not very difficult to find work, because I had to seek work not as a skilled tradesman but as a so-called extra-hand ready to take any job that turned up by chance, just for the sake of earning my daily bread.

Thus I found myself in the same situation as all those emigrants who shake the dust of Europe from their feet, with the cast-iron determination to lay the foundations of a new existence in the New World and acquire for themselves a new home. 

Liberated from all the paralysing prejudices of class and calling, environment and tradition, they enter any service that opens its doors to them, accepting any work that comes their way, filled more and more with the idea that honest work never disgraced anybody, no matter what kind it may be. And so I was resolved to set both feet in what was for me a new
world and push forward on my own road.

I soon found out that there was some kind of work always to be got, but I also learned that it could just as quickly and easily be lost. The uncertainty of being able to earn a  regular daily livelihood soon appeared to me as the gloomiest feature in this new life that I had entered.

Although the skilled worker was not so frequently thrown idle on the streets as the unskilled worker, yet the former was by no means protected against the same fate; because though he may not have to face hunger as a result of unemployment due to the lack of demand in the labour market, the lock-out and the strike deprived the skilled worker of the chance to earn his bread. Here the element of uncertainty in steadily earning one's daily bread was the bitterest feature of the whole social-economic system itself.

The country lad who migrates to the big city feels attracted by what has been described as easy work--which it may be in reality--and few working hours. He is especially entranced by the magic glimmer spread over the big cities. Accustomed in the country to earn a steady wage, he has been taught not to quit his former post until a new one is at least in sight. 

As there is a great scarcity of agricultural labour, the probability of long unemployment in the country has been very small. 

It is a mistake to presume that the lad who leaves the countryside for the town is not made of such sound material as those who remain at home to work on the land. On the contrary, experience shows that it is the more healthy and more vigorous that emigrate, and not the reverse. Among these emigrants I include not merely those who emigrate to America, but also the servant boy in the country who decides to leave his native village and migrate to the big city where
he will be a stranger. He is ready to take the risk of an uncertain fate. 

In most cases he comes to town with a little money in his pocket and for the first few days he is not discouraged if he should not have the good fortune to find work. But if he finds a job and then loses it in a little while, the case is much worse. To find work anew, especially in winter, is often difficult and indeed sometimes impossible. For the first few weeks life is still bearable He receives his out-of-work money from his trade union and is thus
enabled to carry on. 

But when the last of his own money is gone and his trade union ceases to pay out because of the prolonged unemployment, then comes the real distress. He now loiters about and is hungry. Often he pawns or sells the last of his belongings.

His clothes begin to get shabby and with the increasing poverty of his outward appearance he descends to a lower social level and mixes up with a class of human beings through whom his mind is now poisoned, in addition to his physical misery.
Then he has nowhere to sleep and if that happens in winter, which is very often the
case, he is in dire distress. Finally he gets work. But the old story repeats itself.

A second time the same thing happens. Then a third time; and now it is probably much worse.

Little by little he becomes indifferent to this everlasting insecurity. Finally he grows used to the repetition. Thus even a man who is normally of industrious habits grows careless in his whole attitude towards life and gradually becomes an instrument in the hands of unscrupulous people who exploit him for the sake of their own ignoble aims.

He has been so often thrown out of employment through no fault of his own that he is now more or less indifferent whether the strike in which he takes part be for the  purpose of securing his economic rights or be aimed at the destruction of the State, the whole social order and even civilization itself. 

Though the idea of going on strike may not be to his natural liking, yet he joins in it out of sheer indifference. I saw this process exemplified before my eyes in thousands of cases. 

And the longer I observed it the greater became my dislike for that mammoth city which greedily attracts men to its bosom, in order to break them mercilessly in the end. When they came they still felt themselves in communion with their own people at home; if they remained that tie was broken.

I was thrown about so much in the life of the metropolis that I experienced the workings of this fate in my own person and felt the effects of it in my own soul. One thing stood out clearly before my eyes: It was the sudden changes from work to idleness and vice versa; so that the constant fluctuations thus caused by earnings and expenditure finally destroyed the 'sense of thrift for many people and also the habit of regulating expenditure in an intelligent way. The body appeared to grow accustomed to the vicissitudes of food and hunger, eating heartily in good times and going hungry in
bad. Indeed hunger shatters all plans for rationing expenditure on a regular scale in
better times when employment is again found. 

The reason for this is that the deprivations which the unemployed worker has to endure must be compensated for psychologically by a persistent mental mirage in which he imagines himself eating heartily once again. And this dream develops into such a longing that it turns into a morbid impulse to cast off all self-restraint when work and wages turn up again. 

Therefore the moment work is found anew he forgets to regulate the expenditure of his earnings but spends them to the full without thinking of to-morrow. This leads to confusion in the little weekly housekeeping budget, because the expenditure is not rationally planned. When the phenomenon which I have mentioned first happens, the earnings will last perhaps for five days instead of seven; on subsequent occasions they will last only for three days; as the habit recurs, the earnings will last scarcely for a day; and finally they will disappear in one night of feasting.

Often there are wife and children at home. And in many cases it happens that these become infected by such a way of living, especially if the husband is good to them and wants to do the best he can for them and loves them in his own way and according to his own lights. 

Then the week's earnings are spent in common at home within 2-3 days. 

The family eat and drink together as long as the money lasts and at the end
of the week they hunger together. Then the wife wanders about furtively in the
neighbourhood, borrows a little, and runs up small debts with the shopkeepers in an
effort to pull through the lean days towards the end of the week. They sit down
together to the midday meal with only meagre fare on the table, and often even nothing
to eat. They wait for the coming payday, talking of it and making plans; and while they
are thus hungry they dream of the plenty that is to come. And so the little children
become acquainted with misery in their early years. 

But the evil culminates when the husband goes his own way from the beginning of the
week and the wife protests, simply out of love for the children. Then there are quarrels
and bad feeling and the husband takes to drink according as he becomes estranged
from his wife. He now becomes drunk every Saturday. Fighting for her own existence
and that of the children, the wife has to hound him along the road from the factory to
the tavern in order to get a few shillings from him on payday. Then when he finally
comes home, maybe on the Sunday or the Monday, having parted with his last shillings
and pence, pitiable scenes follow, scenes that cry out for God's mercy.
I have had actual experience of all this in hundreds of cases. At first I was disgusted and
indignant; but later on I came to recognize the whole tragedy of their misfortune and to
understand the profound causes of it. They were the unhappy victims of evil
circumstances.

Housing conditions were very bad at that time. The Vienna manual labourers lived in
surroundings of appalling misery. I shudder even to-day when I think of the woeful
dens in which people dwelt, the night shelters and the slums, and all the tenebrous
spectacles of ordure, loathsome filth and wickedness.
What will happen one day when hordes of emancipated slaves come forth from these
dens of misery to swoop down on their unsuspecting fellow men? For this other world
does not think about such a possibility. They have allowed these things to go on
without caring and even without suspecting--in their total lack of instinctive
understanding--that sooner or later destiny will take its vengeance unless it will have
been appeased in time.

To-day I fervidly thank Providence for having sent me to such a school. There I could
not refuse to take an interest in matters that did not please me. This school soon taught
me a profound lesson.

In order not to despair completely of the people among whom I then lived I had to set
on one side the outward appearances of their lives and on the other the reasons why
they had developed in that way. Then I could hear everything without discouragement;
for those who emerged from all this misfortune and misery, from this filth and outward
degradation, were not human beings as such but rather lamentable results of
lamentable laws. In my own life similar hardships prevented me from giving way to a
pitying sentimentality at the sight of these degraded products which had finally
resulted from the pressure of circumstances. No, the sentimental attitude would be the
wrong one to adopt.

Even in those days I already saw that there was a two-fold method by which alone it
would be possible to bring about an amelioration of these conditions. This method is: 
first, to create better fundamental conditions of social development by establishing a
profound feeling for social responsibilities among the public; second, to combine this
feeling for social responsibilities with a ruthless determination to prune away all
excrescences which are incapable of being improved.

Just as Nature concentrates its greatest attention, not to the maintenance of what
already exists but on the selective breeding of offspring in order to carry on the species,
so in human life also it is less a matter of artificially improving the existing generation--
which, owing to human characteristics, is impossible in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred--and more a matter of securing from the very start a better road for future
development.

During my struggle for existence in Vienna I perceived very clearly that the aim of all
social activity must never be merely charitable relief, which is ridiculous and useless,
but it must rather be a means to find a way of eliminating the fundamental deficiencies
in our economic and cultural life--deficiencies which necessarily bring about the
degradation of the individual or at least lead him towards such degradation. 

The
difficulty of employing every means, even the most drastic, to eradicate the hostility
prevailing among the working classes towards the State is largely due to an attitude of
uncertainty in deciding upon the inner motives and causes of this contemporary
phenomenon. The grounds of this uncertainty are to be found exclusively in the sense
of guilt which each individual feels for having permitted this tragedy of degradation.

For that feeling paralyses every effort at making a serious and firm decision to act. And
thus because the people whom it concerns are vacillating they are timid and halfhearted in putting into effect even the measures which are indispensable for selfpreservation. When the individual is no longer burdened with his own consciousness of blame in this regard, then and only then will he have that inner tranquillity and outer
force to cut off drastically and ruthlessly all the parasite growth and root out the weeds.
But because the Austrian State had almost no sense of social rights or social legislation
its inability to abolish those evil excrescences was manifest.

I do not know what it was that appalled me most at that time: the economic misery of
those who were then my companions, their crude customs and morals, or the low level
of their intellectual culture.

How often our bourgeoisie rises up in moral indignation on hearing from the mouth of
some pitiable tramp that it is all the same to him whether he be a German or not and
that he will find himself at home wherever he can get enough to keep body and soul
together. They protest sternly against such a lack of 'national pride' and strongly
express their horror at such sentiments. 

But how many people really ask themselves why it is that their own sentiments are better? How many of them understand that their natural pride in being members of so favoured a nation arises from the innumerable succession of instances they have encountered which remind them of the greatness of the Fatherland and the Nation in all spheres of artistic and cultural life? How many of them realize that pride in the Fatherland is largely dependent on knowledge of its greatness in all those spheres? Do our bourgeois circles ever think what a ridiculously meagre share the people have in that knowledge which is a necessary prerequisite for the feeling of pride in one's fatherland?

It cannot be objected here that in other countries similar conditions exist and that nevertheless the working classes in those countries have remained patriotic. Even if that were so, it would be no excuse for our negligent attitude. But it is not so. What we call chauvinistic education--in the case of the French people, for example--is only the excessive exaltation of the greatness of France in all spheres of culture or, as the French say, civilization.
