The French boy is not educated on purely objective principles.

Wherever the importance of the political and cultural greatness of his country is
concerned he is taught in the most subjective way that one can imagine.
This education will always have to be confined to general ideas in a large perspective
and these ought to be deeply engraven, by constant repetition if necessary, on the
memories and feelings of the people.

In our case, however, we are not merely guilty of negative sins of omission but also of
positively perverting the little which some individuals had the luck to learn at school.
The rats that poison our body-politic gnaw from the hearts and memories of the broad
masses even that little which distress and misery have left.
Let the reader try to picture the following:

There is a lodging in a cellar and this lodging consists of two damp rooms. In these
rooms a workman and his family live--seven people in all. Let us assume that one of the
children is a boy of three years. That is the age at which children first become conscious
of the impressions which they receive. In the case of highly gifted people traces of the
impressions received in those early years last in the memory up to an advanced age.
Now the narrowness and congestion of those living quarters do not conduce to pleasant
inter-relations. 

Thus quarrels and fits of mutual anger arise. These people can hardly be
said to live with one another, but rather down on top of one another. The small
misunderstandings which disappear of themselves in a home where there is enough
space for people to go apart from one another for a while, here become the source of
chronic disputes. As far as the children are concerned the situation is tolerable from this
point of view. In such conditions they are constantly quarrelling with one another, but
the quarrels are quickly and entirely forgotten. But when the parents fall out with one 
another these daily bickerings often descend to rudeness such as cannot be adequately
imagined. 

The results of such experiences must become apparent later on in the
children. One must have practical experience of such a MILIEU so as to be able to
picture the state of affairs that arises from these mutual recriminations when the father
physically assaults the mother and maltreats her in a fit of drunken rage. At the age of
six the child can no longer ignore those sordid details which even an adult would find
revolting. Infected with moral poison, bodily undernourished, and the poor little head
filled with vermin, the young 'citizen' goes to the primary school. With difficulty he
barely learns to read and write. There is no possibility of learning any lessons at home.
Quite the contrary. The father and mother themselves talk before the children in the
most disparaging way about the teacher and the school and they are much more
inclined to insult the teachers than to put their offspring across the knee and knock
sound reason into him. What the little fellow hears at home does not tend to increase
respect for his human surroundings. 

Here nothing good is said of human nature as a
whole and every institution, from the school to the government, is reviled. Whether
religion and morals are concerned or the State and the social order, it is all the same;
they are all scoffed at. When the young lad leaves school, at the age of fourteen, it
would be difficult to say what are the most striking features of his character, incredible
ignorance in so far as real knowledge is concerned or cynical impudence combined with
an attitude towards morality which is really startling at so young an age.
What station in life can such a person fill, to whom nothing is sacred, who has never
experienced anything noble but, on the contrary, has been intimately acquainted with
the lowest kind of human existence? This child of three has got into the habit of reviling
all authority by the time he is fifteen. He has been acquainted only with moral filth and
vileness, everything being excluded that might stimulate his thought towards higher
things. And now this young specimen of humanity enters the school of life.
He leads the same kind of life which was exemplified for him by his father during his
childhood. He loiters about and comes home at all hours. He now even black-guards
that broken-hearted being who gave him birth. He curses God and the world and
finally ends up in a House of Correction for young people. There he gets the final
polish.

And his bourgeois contemporaries are astonished at the lack of 'patriotic enthusiasm'
which this young 'citizen' manifests.

Day after day the bourgeois world are witnesses to the phenomenon of spreading
poison among the people through the instrumentality of the theatre and the cinema,
gutter journalism and obscene books; and yet they are astonished at the deplorable
'moral standards' and 'national indifference' of the masses. As if the cinema bilge and
the gutter press and suchlike could inculcate knowledge of the greatness of one's
country, apart entirely from the earlier education of the individual. 

I then came to understand, quickly and thoroughly, what I had never been aware of
before. It was the following:
The question of 'nationalizing' a people is first and foremost one of establishing healthy
social conditions which will furnish the grounds that are necessary for the education of
the individual. For only when family upbringing and school education have inculcated
in the individual a knowledge of the cultural and economic and, above all, the political
greatness of his own country--then, and then only, will it be possible for him to feel
proud of being a citizen of such a country. I can fight only for something that I love. I
can love only what I respect. And in order to respect a thing I must at least have some
knowledge of it.

As soon as my interest in social questions was once awakened I began to study them in
a fundamental way. A new and hitherto unknown world was thus revealed to me.
In the years 1909-10 I had so far improved my, position that I no longer had to earn my
daily bread as a manual labourer. I was now working independently as draughtsman,
and painter in water colours. This MÉTIER was a poor one indeed as far as earnings
were concerned; for these were only sufficient to meet the bare exigencies of life. Yet it
had an interest for me in view of the profession to which I aspired. Moreover, when I
came home in the evenings I was now no longer dead-tired as formerly, when I used to
be unable to look into a book without falling asleep almost immediately. My present
occupation therefore was in line with the profession I aimed at for the future. Moreover,
I was master of my own time and could distribute my working-hours now better than
formerly. I painted in order to earn my bread, and I studied because I liked it.
Thus I was able to acquire that theoretical knowledge of the social problem which was a
necessary complement to what I was learning through actual experience. I studied all
the books which I could find that dealt with this question and I thought deeply on what
I read. I think that the MILIEU in which I then lived considered me an eccentric person.
Besides my interest in the social question I naturally devoted myself with enthusiasm to
the study of architecture. 

Side by side with music, I considered it queen of the arts. To
study it was for me not work but pleasure. I could read or draw until the small hours of
the morning without ever getting tired. And I became more and more confident that my
dream of a brilliant future would become true, even though I should have to wait long
years for its fulfilment. I was firmly convinced that one day I should make a name for
myself as an architect.

The fact that, side by side with my professional studies, I took the greatest interest in
everything that had to do with politics did not seem to me to signify anything of great
importance. On the contrary: I looked upon this practical interest in politics merely as 
part of an elementary obligation that devolves on every thinking man. Those who have
no understanding of the political world around them have no right to criticize or
complain. On political questions therefore I still continued to read and study a great
deal. But reading had probably a different significance for me from that which it has for
the average run of our so-called 'intellectuals'.

I know people who read interminably, book after book, from page to page, and yet I
should not call them 'well-read people'. Of course they 'know' an immense amount; but
their brain seems incapable of assorting and classifying the material which they have
gathered from books. They have not the faculty of distinguishing between what is
useful and useless in a book; so that they may retain the former in their minds and if
possible skip over the latter while reading it, if that be not possible, then--when once
read--throw it overboard as useless ballast.

Reading is not an end in itself, but a means
to an end. Its chief purpose is to help towards filling in the framework which is made
up of the talents and capabilities that each individual possesses. Thus each one procures
for himself the implements and materials necessary for the fulfilment of his calling in
life, no matter whether this be the elementary task of earning one's daily bread or a
calling that responds to higher human aspirations. 

Such is the first purpose of reading.
And the second purpose is to give a general knowledge of the world in which we live.
In both cases, however, the material which one has acquired through reading must not
be stored up in the memory on a plan that corresponds to the successive chapters of the
book; but each little piece of knowledge thus gained must be treated as if it were a little
stone to be inserted into a mosaic, so that it finds its proper place among all the other
pieces and particles that help to form a general world-picture in the brain of the reader.
Otherwise only a confused jumble of chaotic notions will result from all this reading.
That jumble is not merely useless, but it also tends to make the unfortunate possessor of
it conceited. For he seriously considers himself a well-educated person and thinks that
he understands something of life. He believes that he has acquired knowledge, whereas
the truth is that every increase in such 'knowledge' draws him more and more away
from real life, until he finally ends up in some sanatorium or takes to politics and
becomes a parliamentary deputy.

Such a person never succeeds in turning his knowledge to practical account when the
opportune moment arrives; for his mental equipment is not ordered with a view to
meeting the demands of everyday life. His knowledge is stored in his brain as a literal
transcript of the books he has read and the order of succession in which he has read
them. And if Fate should one day call upon him to use some of his book-knowledge for
certain practical ends in life that very call will have to name the book and give the
number of the page; for the poor noodle himself would never be able to find the spot
where he gathered the information now called for. But if the page is not mentioned at
the critical moment the widely-read intellectual will find himself in a state of hopeless
embarrassment. In a high state of agitation he searches for analogous cases and it is
almost a dead certainty that he will finally deliver the wrong prescription. 
If that is not a correct description, then how can we explain the political achievements
of our Parliamentary heroes who hold the highest positions in the government of the
country? Otherwise we should have to attribute the doings of such political leaders, not
to pathological conditions but simply to malice and chicanery.

On the other hand, one who has cultivated the art of reading will instantly discern, in a
book or journal or pamphlet, what ought to be remembered because it meets one's
personal needs or is of value as general knowledge. What he thus learns is incorporated
in his mental analogue of this or that problem or thing, further correcting the mental
picture or enlarging it so that it becomes more exact and precise. Should some practical
problem suddenly demand examination or solution, memory will immediately select
the opportune information from the mass that has been acquired through years of
reading and will place this information at the service of one's powers of judgment so as
to get a new and clearer view of the problem in question or produce a definitive
solution.

Only thus can reading have any meaning or be worth while.
The speaker, for example, who has not the sources of information ready to hand which
are necessary to a proper treatment of his subject is unable to defend his opinions
against an opponent, even though those opinions be perfectly sound and true. In every
discussion his memory will leave him shamefully in the lurch. He cannot summon up
arguments to support his statements or to refute his opponent. So long as the speaker
has only to defend himself on his own personal account, the situation is not serious; but
the evil comes when Chance places at the head of public affairs such a soi-disant knowit-all, who in reality knows nothing.
