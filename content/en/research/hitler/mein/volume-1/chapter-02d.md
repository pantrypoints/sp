From early youth I endeavoured to read books in the right way and I was fortunate in
having a good memory and intelligence to assist me. From that point of view my
sojourn in Vienna was particularly useful and profitable. My experiences of everyday
life there were a constant stimulus to study the most diverse problems from new angles.
Inasmuch as I was in a position to put theory to the test of reality and reality to the test
of theory, I was safe from the danger of pedantic theorizing on the one hand and, on the
other, from being too impressed by the superficial aspects of reality.
The experience of everyday life at that time determined me to make a fundamental
theoretical study of two most important questions outside of the social question.
It is impossible to say when I might have started to make a thorough study of the
doctrine and characteristics of Marxism were it not for the fact that I then literally ran
head foremost into the problem. 

What I knew of Social Democracy in my youth was precious little and that little was for
the most part wrong. The fact that it led the struggle for universal suffrage and the
secret ballot gave me an inner satisfaction; for my reason then told me that this would
weaken the Habsburg regime, which I so thoroughly detested. I was convinced that
even if it should sacrifice the German element the Danubian State could not continue to
exist. Even at the price of a long and slow Slaviz-ation of the Austrian Germans the
State would secure no guarantee of a really durable Empire; because it was very
questionable if and how far the Slavs possessed the necessary capacity for constructive
politics. Therefore I welcomed every movement that might lead towards the final
disruption of that impossible State which had decreed that it would stamp out the
German character in ten millions of people. The more this babel of tongues wrought
discord and disruption, even in the Parliament, the nearer the hour approached for the
dissolution of this Babylonian Empire. That would mean the liberation of my German
Austrian people, and only then would it become possible for them to be re-united to the
Motherland.

Accordingly I had no feelings of antipathy towards the actual policy of the Social
Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes--
which in my ignorance I then foolishly believed--was a further reason why I should
speak in favour of Social Democracy rather than against it. But the features that
contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic movement was its hostile
attitude towards the struggle for the conservation of Germanism in Austria, its
lamentable cocotting with the Slav 'comrades', who received these approaches
favourably as long as any practical advantages were forthcoming but otherwise
maintained a haughty reserve, thus giving the importunate mendicants the sort of
answer their behaviour deserved.

And so at the age of seventeen the word 'Marxism' was very little known to me, while I
looked on 'Social Democracy' and 'Socialism' as synonymous expressions. It was only as
the result of a sudden blow from the rough hand of Fate that my eyes were opened to
the nature of this unparalleled system for duping the public.
Hitherto my acquaintance with the Social Democratic Party was only that of a mere
spectator at some of their mass meetings. I had not the slightest idea of the socialdemocratic teaching or the mentality of its partisans. All of a sudden I was brought face
to face with the products of their teaching and what they called their
WELTANSCHAUUNG. 

In this way a few months sufficed for me to learn something
which under other circumstances might have necessitated decades of study--namely,
that under the cloak of social virtue and love of one's neighbour a veritable pestilence
was spreading abroad and that if this pestilence be not stamped out of the world
without delay it may eventually succeed in exterminating the human race.
I first came into contact with the Social Democrats while working in the building trade. 
From the very time that I started work the situation was not very pleasant for me. My
clothes were still rather decent. I was careful of my speech and I was reserved in
manner. I was so occupied with thinking of my own present lot and future possibilities
that I did not take much of an interest in my immediate surroundings. I had sought
work so that I shouldn't starve and at the same time so as to be able to make further
headway with my studies, though this headway might be slow. Possibly I should not
have bothered to be interested in my companions were it not that on the third or fourth
day an event occurred which forced me to take a definite stand. I was ordered to join
the trade union.

At that time I knew nothing about the trades unions. I had had no opportunity of
forming an opinion on their utility or inutility, as the case might be. But when I was told
that I must join the union I refused. The grounds which I gave for my refusal were
simply that I knew nothing about the matter and that anyhow I would not allow myself
to be forced into anything. Probably the former reason saved me from being thrown out
right away. They probably thought that within a few days I might be converted' and
become more docile. But if they thought that they were profoundly mistaken. After two
weeks I found it utterly impossible for me to take such a step, even if I had been willing
to take it at first. During those fourteen days I came to know my fellow workmen better,
and no power in the world could have moved me to join an organization whose
representatives had meanwhile shown themselves in a light which I found so
unfavourable.

During the first days my resentment was aroused.
At midday some of my fellow workers used to adjourn to the nearest tavern, while the
others remained on the building premises and there ate their midday meal, which in
most cases was a very scanty one. These were married men. Their wives brought them
the midday soup in dilapidated vessels. Towards the end of the week there was a
gradual increase in the number of those who remained to eat their midday meal on the
building premises. I understood the reason for this afterwards. They now talked
politics.

I drank my bottle of milk and ate my morsel of bread somewhere on the outskirts, while
I circumspectly studied my environment or else fell to meditating on my own harsh lot.
Yet I heard more than enough. And I often thought that some of what they said was
meant for my ears, in the hope of bringing me to a decision. But all that I heard had the
effect of arousing the strongest antagonism in me. Everything was disparaged--the
nation, because it was held to be an invention of the 'capitalist' class (how often I had to
listen to that phrase!); the Fatherland, because it was held to be an instrument in the
hands of the bourgeoisie for the exploitation of' the working masses; the authority of the
law, because that was a means of holding down the proletariat; religion, as a means of 
doping the people, so as to exploit them afterwards; morality, as a badge of stupid and
sheepish docility. There was nothing that they did not drag in the mud.

At first I remained silent; but that could not last very long. Then I began to take part in
the discussion and to reply to their statements. I had to recognize, however, that this
was bound to be entirely fruitless, as long as I did not have at least a certain amount of
definite information about the questions that were discussed. So I decided to consult the
source from which my interlocutors claimed to have drawn their so-called wisdom. I
devoured book after book, pamphlet after pamphlet.

Meanwhile, we argued with one another on the building premises. From day to day I
was becoming better informed than my companions in the subjects on which they
claimed to be experts. Then a day came when the more redoubtable of my adversaries
resorted to the most effective weapon they had to replace the force of reason. This was
intimidation and physical force. Some of the leaders among my adversaries ordered me
to leave the building or else get flung down from the scaffolding. As I was quite alone I
could not put up any physical resistance; so I chose the first alternative and departed,
richer however by an experience.

I went away full of disgust; but at the same time so deeply moved that it was quite
impossible for me to turn my back on the whole situation and think no more about it.
When my anger began to calm down the spirit of obstinacy got the upper hand and I
decided that at all costs I would get back to work again in the building trade. This
decision became all the stronger a few weeks later, when my little savings had entirely
run out and hunger clutched me once again in its merciless arms. No alternative was
left to me. I got work again and had to leave it for the same reasons as before.
Then I asked myself: Are these men worthy of belonging to a great people? The
question was profoundly disturbing; for if the answer were 'Yes', then the struggle to
defend one's nationality is no longer worth all the trouble and sacrifice we demand of
our best elements if it be in the interests of such a rabble. On the other hand, if the
answer had to be 'No--these men are not worthy of the nation', then our nation is poor
indeed in men. During those days of mental anguish and deep meditation I saw before
my mind the ever-increasing and menacing army of people who could no longer be
reckoned as belonging to their own nation.

It was with quite a different feeling, some days later, that I gazed on the interminable
ranks, four abreast, of Viennese workmen parading at a mass demonstration. I stood
dumbfounded for almost two hours, watching that enormous human dragon which
slowly uncoiled itself there before me. When I finally left the square and wandered in
the direction of my lodgings I felt dismayed and depressed. On my way I noticed the
ARBEITERZEITUNG (The Workman's Journal) in a tobacco shop. This was the chief
press-organ of the old Austrian Social Democracy. In a cheap café, where the common 
people used to foregather and where I often went to read the papers, the
ARBEITERZEITUNG was also displayed. But hitherto I could not bring myself to do
more than glance at the wretched thing for a couple of minutes: for its whole tone was a
sort of mental vitriol to me. Under the depressing influence of the demonstration I had
witnessed, some interior voice urged me to buy the paper in that tobacco shop and read
it through. So I brought it home with me and spent the whole evening reading it,
despite the steadily mounting rage provoked by this ceaseless outpouring of
falsehoods.

I now found that in the social democratic daily papers I could study the inner character
of this politico-philosophic system much better than in all their theoretical literature.
For there was a striking discrepancy between the two. In the literary effusions which
dealt with the theory of Social Democracy there was a display of high-sounding
phraseology about liberty and human dignity and beauty, all promulgated with an air
of profound wisdom and serene prophetic assurance; a meticulously-woven glitter of
words to dazzle and mislead the reader. On the other hand, the daily Press inculcated
this new doctrine of human redemption in the most brutal fashion. No means were too
base, provided they could be exploited in the campaign of slander. These journalists
were real virtuosos in the art of twisting facts and presenting them in a deceptive form.
The theoretical literature was intended for the simpletons of the soi-disant intellectuals
belonging to the middle and, naturally, the upper classes. The newspaper propaganda
was intended for the masses.

This probing into books and newspapers and studying the teachings of Social
Democracy reawakened my love for my own people. And thus what at first seemed an
impassable chasm became the occasion of a closer affection.
Having once understood the working of the colossal system for poisoning the popular
mind, only a fool could blame the victims of it. During the years that followed I became
more independent and, as I did so, I became better able to understand the inner cause of
the success achieved by this Social Democratic gospel. I now realized the meaning and
purpose of those brutal orders which prohibited the reading of all books and
newspapers that were not 'red' and at the same time demanded that only the 'red'
meetings should be attended. In the clear light of brutal reality I was able to see what
must have been the inevitable consequences of that intolerant teaching.
The PSYCHE of the broad masses is accessible only to what is strong and
uncompromising. Like a woman whose inner sensibilities are not so much under the
sway of abstract reasoning but are always subject to the influence of a vague emotional
longing for the strength that completes her being, and who would rather bow to the
strong man than dominate the weakling--in like manner the masses of the people prefer
the ruler to the suppliant and are filled with a stronger sense of mental security by a 
teaching that brooks no rival than by a teaching which offers them a liberal choice. They
have very little idea of how to make such a choice and thus they are prone to feel that
they have been abandoned. They feel very little shame at being terrorized intellectually
and they are scarcely conscious of the fact that their freedom as human beings is
impudently abused; and thus they have not the slightest suspicion of the intrinsic
fallacy of the whole doctrine. They see only the ruthless force and brutality of its
determined utterances, to which they always submit.
