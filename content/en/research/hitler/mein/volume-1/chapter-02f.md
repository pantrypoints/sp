It is superfluous to ask whether the Trades Union is indispensable.

So long as there are employers who attack social understanding and have wrong ideas
of justice and fair play it is not only the right but also the duty of their employees--who
are, after all, an integral part of our people--to protect the general interests against the
greed and unreason of the individual. For to safeguard the loyalty and confidence of the
people is as much in the interests of the nation as to safeguard public health.

Both are seriously menaced by dishonourable employers who are not conscious of their
duty as members of the national community. Their personal avidity or irresponsibility
sows the seeds of future trouble. To eliminate the causes of such a development is an
action that surely deserves well of the country.

It must not be answered here that the individual workman is free at any time to escape
from the consequences of an injustice which he has actually suffered at the hands of an
employer, or which he thinks he has suffered--in other words, he can leave. No. That
argument is only a ruse to detract attention from the question at issue. Is it, or is it not,
in the interests of the nation to remove the causes of social unrest? If it is, then the fight
must be carried on with the only weapons that promise success. But the individual
workman is never in a position to stand up against the might of the big employer; for 
the question here is not one that concerns the triumph of right. If in such a relation right
had been recognized as the guiding principle, then the conflict could not have arisen at
all. But here it is a question of who is the stronger. If the case were otherwise, the
sentiment of justice alone would solve the dispute in an honourable way; or, to put the
case more correctly, matters would not have come to such a dispute at all.

No. If unsocial and dishonourable treatment of men provokes resistance, then the
stronger party can impose its decision in the conflict until the constitutional legislative
authorities do away with the evil through legislation. Therefore it is evident that if the
individual workman is to have any chance at all of winning through in the struggle he
must be grouped with his fellow workmen and present a united front before the
individual employer, who incorporates in his own person the massed strength of the
vested interests in the industrial or commercial undertaking which he conducts.
Thus the trades unions can hope to inculcate and strengthen a sense of social
responsibility in workaday life and open the road to practical results. In doing this they
tend to remove those causes of friction which are a continual source of discontent and
complaint.

Blame for the fact that the trades unions do not fulfil this much-desired function must
be laid at the doors of those who barred the road to legislative social reform, or
rendered such a reform ineffective by sabotaging it through their political influence.
The political bourgeoisie failed to understand--or, rather, they did not wish to
understand--the importance of the trades union movement. The Social Democrats
accordingly seized the advantage offered them by this mistaken policy and took the
labour movement under their exclusive protection, without any protest from the other
side. In this way they established for themselves a solid bulwark behind which they
could safely retire whenever the struggle assumed a critical aspect. Thus the genuine
purpose of the movement gradually fell into oblivion, and was replaced by new
objectives. For the Social Democrats never troubled themselves to respect and uphold
the original purpose for which the trade unionist movement was founded. They simply
took over the Movement, lock, stock and barrel, to serve their own political ends.

Within a few decades the Trades Union Movement was transformed, by the expert
hand of Social Democracy, from an instrument which had been originally fashioned for
the defence of human rights into an instrument for the destruction of the national
economic structure. The interests of the working class were not allowed for a moment
to cross the path of this purpose; for in politics the application of economic pressure is
always possible if the one side be sufficiently unscrupulous and the other sufficiently
inert and docile. In this case both conditions were fulfilled. 

By the beginning of the present century the Trades Unionist Movement had already
ceased to recognize the purpose for which it had been founded. From year to year it fell
more and more under the political control of the Social Democrats, until it finally came
to be used as a battering-ram in the class struggle. The plan was to shatter, by means of
constantly repeated blows, the economic edifice in the building of which so much time
and care had been expended. Once this objective had been reached, the destruction of
the State would become a matter of course, because the State would already have been
deprived of its economic foundations. 

Attention to the real interests of the workingclasses, on the part of the Social Democrats, steadily decreased until the cunning leaders
saw that it would be in their immediate political interests if the social and cultural
demands of the broad masses remained unheeded; for there was a danger that if these
masses once felt content they could no longer be employed as mere passive material in
the political struggle.

The gloomy prospect which presented itself to the eyes of the CONDOTTIERI of the
class warfare, if the discontent of the masses were no longer available as a war weapon,
created so much anxiety among them that they suppressed and opposed even the most
elementary measures of social reform. And conditions were such that those leaders did
not have to trouble about attempting to justify such an illogical policy.
As the masses were taught to increase and heighten their demands the possibility of
satisfying them dwindled and whatever ameliorative measures were taken became less
and less significant; so that it was at that time possible to persuade the masses that this
ridiculous measure in which the most sacred claims of the working-classes were being
granted represented a diabolical plan to weaken their fighting power in this easy way
and, if possible, to paralyse it. One will not be astonished at the success of these
allegations if one remembers what a small measure of thinking power the broad masses
possess.

In the bourgeois camp there was high indignation over the bad faith of the Social
Democratic tactics; but nothing was done to draw a practical conclusion and organize a
counter attack from the bourgeois side. The fear of the Social Democrats, to improve the
miserable conditions of the working-classes ought to have induced the bourgeois
parties to make the most energetic efforts in this direction and thus snatch from the
hands of the class-warfare leaders their most important weapon; but nothing of this
kind happened.

Instead of attacking the position of their adversaries the bourgeoisie allowed itself to be
pressed and harried. Finally it adopted means that were so tardy and so insignificant
that they were ineffective and were repudiated. So the whole situation remained just as
it had been before the bourgeois intervention; but the discontent had thereby become
more serious. 

Like a threatening storm, the 'Free Trades Union' hovered above the political horizon
and above the life of each individual. It was one of the most frightful instruments of
terror that threatened the security and independence of the national economic structure,
the foundations of the State and the liberty of the individual. Above all, it was the 'Free
Trades Union' that turned democracy into a ridiculous and scorned phrase, insulted the
ideal of liberty and stigmatized that of fraternity with the slogan 'If you will not become
our comrade we shall crack your skull'.

It was thus that I then came to know this friend of humanity. During the years that
followed my knowledge of it became wider and deeper; but I have never changed
anything in that regard.

The more I became acquainted with the external forms of Social Democracy, the greater
became my desire to understand the inner nature of its doctrines.
For this purpose the official literature of the Party could not help very much. In
discussing economic questions its statements were false and its proofs unsound. In
treating of political aims its attitude was insincere.

Furthermore, its modern methods of
chicanery in the presentation of its arguments were profoundly repugnant to me. Its
flamboyant sentences, its obscure and incomprehensible phrases, pretended to contain
great thoughts, but they were devoid of thought, and meaningless. One would have to
be a decadent Bohemian in one of our modern cities in order to feel at home in that
labyrinth of mental aberration, so that he might discover 'intimate experiences' amid the
stinking fumes of this literary Dadism. These writers were obviously counting on the
proverbial humility of a certain section of our people, who believe that a person who is
incomprehensible must be profoundly wise.

In confronting the theoretical falsity and absurdity of that doctrine with the reality of its
external manifestations, I gradually came to have a clear idea of the ends at which it
aimed.

During such moments I had dark presentiments and feared something evil. I had before
me a teaching inspired by egoism and hatred, mathematically calculated to win its
victory, but the triumph of which would be a mortal blow to humanity.
Meanwhile I had discovered the relations existing between this destructive teaching
and the specific character of a people, who up to that time had been to me almost
unknown.

Knowledge of the Jews is the only key whereby one may understand the inner nature
and therefore the real aims of Social Democracy. 

The man who has come to know this race has succeeded in removing from his eyes the
veil through which he had seen the aims and meaning of his Party in a false light; and
then, out of the murk and fog of social phrases rises the grimacing figure of Marxism.
To-day it is hard and almost impossible for me to say when the word 'Jew' first began to
raise any particular thought in my mind. I do not remember even having heard the
word at home during my father's lifetime. If this name were mentioned in a derogatory
sense I think the old gentleman would just have considered those who used it in this
way as being uneducated reactionaries. In the course of his career he had come to be
more or less a cosmopolitan, with strong views on nationalism, which had its effect on
me as well. In school, too, I found no reason to alter the picture of things I had formed
at home.
