At the REALSCHULE I knew one Jewish boy.

We were all on our guard in our relations with him, but only because his reticence and certain actions of his warned us to be discreet. 

Beyond that my companions and myself formed no particular opinions in regard to him.

It was not until I was fourteen or fifteen years old that I frequently ran up against the
word 'Jew', partly in connection with political controversies. These references aroused a
slight aversion in me, and I could not avoid an uncomfortable feeling which always
came over me when I had to listen to religious disputes. But at that time I had no other
feelings about the Jewish question.

There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews who lived there
had become Europeanized in external appearance and were so much like other human
beings that I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then
perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only external mark which I
recognized as distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As
I thought that they were persecuted on account of their Faith my aversion to hearing
remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. I did not in the least
suspect that there could be such a thing as a systematic anti-Semitism.
Then I came to Vienna.

Confused by the mass of impressions I received from the architectural surroundings
and depressed by my own troubles, I did not at first distinguish between the different
social strata of which the population of that mammoth city was composed. Although
Vienna then had about two hundred thousand Jews among its population of two
millions, I did not notice them. During the first weeks of my sojourn my eyes and my
mind were unable to cope with the onrush of new ideas and values. Not until I
gradually settled down to my surroundings, and the confused picture began to grow 
clearer, did I acquire a more discriminating view of my new world. And with that I
came up against the Jewish problem.

I will not say that the manner in which I first became acquainted with it was
particularly unpleasant for me. In the Jew I still saw only a man who was of a different
religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea that he
should be attacked because he had a different faith. And so I considered that the tone
adopted by the anti-Semitic Press in Vienna was unworthy of the cultural traditions of a
great people. The memory of certain events which happened in the middle ages came
into my mind, and I felt that I should not like to see them repeated. Generally speaking,
these anti-Semitic newspapers did not belong to the first rank--but I did not then
understand the reason of this--and so I regarded them more as the products of jealousy
and envy rather than the expression of a sincere, though wrong-headed, feeling.
My own opinions were confirmed by what I considered to be the infinitely more
dignified manner in which the really great Press replied to those attacks or simply
ignored them, which latter seemed to me the most respectable way.

I diligently read what was generally called the World Press--NEUE FREIE PRESSE,
WIENER TAGEBLATT, etc.--and I was astonished by the abundance of information
they gave their readers and the impartial way in which they presented particular
problems. I appreciated their dignified tone; but sometimes the flamboyancy of the style
was unconvincing, and I did not like it. But I attributed all this to the overpowering
influence of the world metropolis.

Since I considered Vienna at that time as such a world metropolis, I thought this
constituted sufficient grounds to excuse these shortcomings of the Press. But I was
frequently disgusted by the grovelling way in which the Vienna Press played lackey to
the Court. Scarcely a move took place at the Hofburg which was not presented in
glorified colours to the readers. It was a foolish practice, which, especially when it had
to do with 'The Wisest Monarch of all Times', reminded one almost of the dance which
the mountain cock performs at pairing time to woo his mate. It was all empty nonsense.
And I thought that such a policy was a stain on the ideal of liberal democracy. I thought
that this way of currying favour at the Court was unworthy of the people. And that was
the first blot that fell on my appreciation of the great Vienna Press.

While in Vienna I continued to follow with a vivid interest all the events that were
taking place in Germany, whether connected with political or cultural question. I had a
feeling of pride and admiration when I compared the rise of the young German Empire
with the decline of the Austrian State. But, although the foreign policy of that Empire
was a source of real pleasure on the whole, the internal political happenings were not
always so satisfactory. I did not approve of the campaign which at that time was being
carried on against William II. I looked upon him not only as the German Emperor but, 
above all, as the creator of the German Navy. The fact that the Emperor was prohibited
from speaking in the Reichstag made me very angry, because the prohibition came from
a side which in my eyes had no authority to make it. For at a single sitting those same
parliamentary ganders did more cackling together than the whole dynasty of Emperors,
comprising even the weakest, had done in the course of centuries.

It annoyed me to have to acknowledge that in a nation where any half-witted fellow
could claim for himself the right to criticize and might even be let loose on the people as
a 'Legislator' in the Reichstag, the bearer of the Imperial Crown could be the subject of a
'reprimand' on the part of the most miserable assembly of drivellers that had ever
existed.

I was even more disgusted at the way in which this same Vienna Press salaamed
obsequiously before the meanest steed belonging to the Habsburg royal equipage and
went off into wild ecstacies of delight if the nag wagged its tail in response. And at the
same time these newspapers took up an attitude of anxiety in matters that concerned
the German Emperor, trying to cloak their enmity by the serious air they gave
themselves. But in my eyes that enmity appeared to be only poorly cloaked. Naturally
they protested that they had no intention of mixing in Germany's internal affairs--God
forbid! They pretended that by touching a delicate spot in such a friendly way they
were fulfilling a duty that devolved upon them by reason of the mutual alliance
between the two countries and at the same time discharging their obligations of
journalistic truthfulness. Having thus excused themselves about tenderly touching a
sore spot, they bored with the finger ruthlessly into the wound.
That sort of thing made my blood boil. And now I began to be more and more on my
guard when reading the great Vienna Press.

I had to acknowledge, however, that on such subjects one of the anti-Semitic papers--
the DEUTSCHE VOLKSBLATT--acted more decently.
What got still more on my nerves was the repugnant manner in which the big
newspapers cultivated admiration for France. One really had to feel ashamed of being a
German when confronted by those mellifluous hymns of praise for 'the great culturenation'. This wretched Gallomania more often than once made me throw away one of
those 'world newspapers'. I now often turned to the VOLKSBLATT, which was much
smaller in size but which treated such subjects more decently. I was not in accord with
its sharp anti-Semitic tone; but again and again I found that its arguments gave me
grounds for serious thought.

Anyhow, it was as a result of such reading that I came to know the man and the
movement which then determined the fate of Vienna. These were Dr. Karl Lueger and 
the Christian Socialist Movement. At the time I came to Vienna I felt opposed to both. I
looked on the man and the movement as 'reactionary'.
But even an elementary sense of justice enforced me to change my opinion when I had
the opportunity of knowing the man and his work, and slowly that opinion grew into
outspoken admiration when I had better grounds for forming a judgment. To-day, as
well as then, I hold Dr. Karl Lueger as the most eminent type of German Burgermeister.
How many prejudices were thrown over through such a change in my attitude towards
the Christian-Socialist Movement!

My ideas about anti-Semitism changed also in the course of time, but that was the
change which I found most difficult. It cost me a greater internal conflict with myself,
and it was only after a struggle between reason and sentiment that victory began to be
decided in favour of the former. Two years later sentiment rallied to the side of reasons
and became a faithful guardian and counsellor.
At the time of this bitter struggle, between calm reason and the sentiments in which I
had been brought up, the lessons that I learned on the streets of Vienna rendered me
invaluable assistance. A time came when I no longer passed blindly along the street of
the mighty city, as I had done in the early days, but now with my eyes open not only to
study the buildings but also the human beings.

Once, when passing through the inner City, I suddenly encountered a phenomenon in a
long caftan and wearing black side-locks. My first thought was: Is this a Jew? They
certainly did not have this appearance in Linz. I watched the man stealthily and
cautiously; but the longer I gazed at the strange countenance and examined it feature by
feature, the more the question shaped itself in my brain: Is this a German?
As was always my habit with such experiences, I turned to books for help in removing
my doubts. For the first time in my life I bought myself some anti-Semitic pamphlets for
a few pence. But unfortunately they all began with the assumption that in principle the
reader had at least a certain degree of information on the Jewish question or was even
familiar with it. Moreover, the tone of most of these pamphlets was such that I became
doubtful again, because the statements made were partly superficial and the proofs
extraordinarily unscientific. For weeks, and indeed for months, I returned to my old
way of thinking. The subject appeared so enormous and the accusations were so farreaching that I was afraid of dealing with it unjustly and so I became again anxious and
uncertain.

Naturally I could no longer doubt that here there was not a question of Germans who
happened to be of a different religion but rather that there was question of an entirely
different people. For as soon as I began to investigate the matter and observe the Jews,
then Vienna appeared to me in a different light. Wherever I now went I saw Jews, and 
the more I saw of them the more strikingly and clearly they stood out as a different
people from the other citizens. Especially the Inner City and the district northwards
from the Danube Canal swarmed with a people who, even in outer appearance, bore no
similarity to the Germans.

But any indecision which I may still have felt about that point was finally removed by
the activities of a certain section of the Jews themselves. A great movement, called
Zionism, arose among them. Its aim was to assert the national character of Judaism, and
the movement was strongly represented in Vienna.

To outward appearances it seemed as if only one group of Jews championed this
movement, while the great majority disapproved of it, or even repudiated it. But an
investigation of the situation showed that those outward appearances were purposely
misleading. These outward appearances emerged from a mist of theories which had
been produced for reasons of expediency, if not for purposes of downright deception.
For that part of Jewry which was styled Liberal did not disown the Zionists as if they
were not members of their race but rather as brother Jews who publicly professed their
faith in an unpractical way, so as to create a danger for Jewry itself.
Thus there was no real rift in their internal solidarity.
