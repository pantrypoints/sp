This fictitious conflict between the Zionists and the Liberal Jews soon disgusted me as it was:
- false through and through
- in direct contradiction to the moral dignity and immaculate character

 <!-- on which that race had always prided itself. -->

Cleanliness, whether moral or of another kind, had its own peculiar meaning for these people. That they were water-shy was obvious on looking at them and, unfortunately, very often also when not looking at them at all. The odour of those people in caftans often used to make me feel ill. Beyond that there were the unkempt clothes and the
ignoble exterior.

All these details were certainly not attractive; but the revolting feature was that beneath
their unclean exterior one suddenly perceived the moral mildew of the chosen race.
What soon gave me cause for very serious consideration were the activities of the Jews
in certain branches of life, into the mystery of which I penetrated little by little. Was
there any shady undertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which
at least one Jew did not participate? On putting the probing knife carefully to that kind
of abscess one immediately discovered, like a maggot in a putrescent body, a little Jew
who was often blinded by the sudden light.

In my eyes the charge against Judaism became a grave one the moment I discovered the
Jewish activities in the Press, in art, in literature and the theatre. All unctuous protests 
were now more or less futile. One needed only to look at the posters announcing the
hideous productions of the cinema and theatre, and study the names of the authors who
were highly lauded there in order to become permanently adamant on Jewish
questions. Here was a pestilence, a moral pestilence, with which the public was being
infected. It was worse than the Black Plague of long ago. And in what mighty doses this
poison was manufactured and distributed. Naturally, the lower the moral and
intellectual level of such an author of artistic products the more inexhaustible his
fecundity. Sometimes it went so far that one of these fellows, acting like a sewage
pump, would shoot his filth directly in the face of other members of the human race. In
this connection we must remember there is no limit to the number of such people. One
ought to realize that for one, Goethe, Nature may bring into existence ten thousand
such despoilers who act as the worst kind of germ-carriers in poisoning human souls. It
was a terrible thought, and yet it could not be avoided, that the greater number of the
Jews seemed specially destined by Nature to play this shameful part.

And is it for this reason that they can be called the chosen people?

I began then to investigate carefully the names of all the fabricators of these unclean
products in public cultural life. The result of that inquiry was still more disfavourable to
the attitude which I had hitherto held in regard to the Jews. Though my feelings might
rebel a thousand time, reason now had to draw its own conclusions.

The fact that nine-tenths of all the smutty literature, artistic tripe and theatrical
banalities, had to be charged to the account of people who formed scarcely one per cent.
of the nation--that fact could not be gainsaid. It was there, and had to be admitted. Then
I began to examine my favourite 'World Press', with that fact before my mind.

The deeper my soundings went the lesser grew my respect for that Press which I
formerly admired. Its style became still more repellent and I was forced to reject its
ideas as entirely shallow and superficial. To claim that in the presentation of facts and
views its attitude was impartial seemed to me to contain more falsehood than truth. The
writers were--Jews.

Thousands of details that I had scarcely noticed before seemed to me now to deserve
attention. I began to grasp and understand things which I had formerly looked at in a
different light.

I saw the Liberal policy of that Press in another light. Its dignified tone in replying to
the attacks of its adversaries and its dead silence in other cases now became clear to me
as part of a cunning and despicable way of deceiving the readers. Its brilliant theatrical
criticisms always praised the Jewish authors and its adverse, criticism was reserved
exclusively for the Germans. 

The light pin-pricks against William II showed the persistency of its policy, just as did
its systematic commendation of French culture and civilization. The subject matter of
the feuilletons was trivial and often pornographic. The language of this Press as a whole
had the accent of a foreign people. The general tone was openly derogatory to the
Germans and this must have been definitely intentional.

What were the interests that urged the Vienna Press to adopt such a policy? Or did they
do so merely by chance? In attempting to find an answer to those questions I gradually
became more and more dubious.

Then something happened which helped me to come to an early decision. I began to see
through the meaning of a whole series of events that were taking place in other
branches of Viennese life. All these were inspired by a general concept of manners and
morals which was openly put into practice by a large section of the Jews and could be
established as attributable to them. Here, again, the life which I observed on the streets
taught me what evil really is.
The part which the Jews played in the social phenomenon of prostitution, and more
especially in the white slave traffic, could be studied here better than in any other WestEuropean city, with the possible exception of certain ports in Southern France. Walking
by night along the streets of the Leopoldstadt, almost at every turn whether one wished
it or not, one witnessed certain happenings of whose existence the Germans knew
nothing until the War made it possible and indeed inevitable for the soldiers to see such
things on the Eastern front.

A cold shiver ran down my spine when I first ascertained that it was the same kind of
cold-blooded, thick-skinned and shameless Jew who showed his consummate skill in
conducting that revolting exploitation of the dregs of the big city. Then I became fired
with wrath.
I had now no more hesitation about bringing the Jewish problem to light in all its
details. No. Henceforth I was determined to do so. But as I learned to track down the
Jew in all the different spheres of cultural and artistic life, and in the various
manifestations of this life everywhere, I suddenly came upon him in a position where I
had least expected to find him. I now realized that the Jews were the leaders of Social
Democracy. In face of that revelation the scales fell from my eyes. My long inner
struggle was at an end.

In my relations with my fellow workmen I was often astonished to find how easily and
often they changed their opinions on the same questions, sometimes within a few days
and sometimes even within the course of a few hours. I found it difficult to understand
how men who always had reasonable ideas when they spoke as individuals with one
another suddenly lost this reasonableness the moment they acted in the mass. That 
phenomenon often tempted one almost to despair. I used to dispute with them for
hours and when I succeeded in bringing them to what I considered a reasonable way of
thinking I rejoiced at my success. But next day I would find that it had been all in vain.
It was saddening to think I had to begin it all over again. Like a pendulum in its eternal
sway, they would fall back into their absurd opinions.

I was able to understand their position fully. They were dissatisfied with their lot and
cursed the fate which had hit them so hard. They hated their employers, whom they
looked upon as the heartless administrators of their cruel destiny. Often they used
abusive language against the public officials, whom they accused of having no
sympathy with the situation of the working people. They made public protests against
the cost of living and paraded through the streets in defence of their claims. At least all
this could be explained on reasonable grounds. But what was impossible to understand
was the boundless hatred they expressed against their own fellow citizens, how they
disparaged their own nation, mocked at its greatness, reviled its history and dragged
the names of its most illustrious men in the gutter.

This hostility towards their own kith and kin, their own native land and home was as
irrational as it was incomprehensible. It was against Nature.
One could cure that malady temporarily, but only for some days or at least some weeks.
But on meeting those whom one believed to have been converted one found that they
had become as they were before. That malady against Nature held them once again in
its clutches.

I gradually discovered that the Social Democratic Press was predominantly controlled
by Jews. But I did not attach special importance to this circumstance, for the same state
of affairs existed also in other newspapers. But there was one striking fact in this
connection. It was that there was not a single newspaper with which Jews were
connected that could be spoken of as National, in the meaning that my education and
convictions attached to that word.

Making an effort to overcome my natural reluctance, I tried to read articles of this
nature published in the Marxist Press; but in doing so my aversion increased all the
more. And then I set about learning something of the people who wrote and published
this mischievous stuff. From the publisher downwards, all of them were Jews. I recalled
to mind the names of the public leaders of Marxism, and then I realized that most of
them belonged to the Chosen Race--the Social Democratic representatives in the
Imperial Cabinet as well as the secretaries of the Trades Unions and the street agitators.
Everywhere the same sinister picture presented itself. 

I shall never forget the row of names--Austerlitz, David, Adler, Ellenbogen, and others. One fact became quite evident
to me. It was that this alien race held in its hands the leadership of that Social 
Democratic Party with whose minor representatives I had been disputing for months
past. I was happy at last to know for certain that the Jew is not a German.

Thus I finally discovered who were the evil spirits leading our people astray. The
sojourn in Vienna for one year had proved long enough to convince me that no worker
is so rooted in his preconceived notions that he will not surrender them in face of better
and clearer arguments and explanations. Gradually I became an expert in the doctrine
of the Marxists and used this knowledge as an instrument to drive home my own firm
convictions. I was successful in nearly every case. The great masses can be rescued, but
a lot of time and a large share of human patience must be devoted to such work.
But a Jew can never be rescued from his fixed notions.

It was then simple enough to attempt to show them the absurdity of their teaching.
Within my small circle I talked to them until my throat ached and my voice grew
hoarse. I believed that I could finally convince them of the danger inherent in the
Marxist follies. But I only achieved the contrary result. It seemed to me that
immediately the disastrous effects of the Marxist Theory and its application in practice
became evident, the stronger became their obstinacy.

The more I debated with them the more familiar I became with their argumentative
tactics. At the outset they counted upon the stupidity of their opponents, but when they
got so entangled that they could not find a way out they played the trick of acting as
innocent simpletons. Should they fail, in spite of their tricks of logic, they acted as if
they could not understand the counter arguments and bolted away to another field of
discussion. They would lay down truisms and platitudes; and, if you accepted these,
then they were applied to other problems and matters of an essentially different nature
from the original theme. If you faced them with this point they would escape again, and
you could not bring them to make any precise statement. 

Whenever one tried to get a
firm grip on any of these apostles one's hand grasped only jelly and slime which
slipped through the fingers and combined again into a solid mass a moment afterwards.
If your adversary felt forced to give in to your argument, on account of the observers
present, and if you then thought that at last you had gained ground, a surprise was in
store for you on the following day. The Jew would be utterly oblivious to what had
happened the day before, and he would start once again by repeating his former
absurdities, as if nothing had happened. Should you become indignant and remind him
of yesterday's defeat, he pretended astonishment and could not remember anything,
except that on the previous day he had proved that his statements were correct.
Sometimes I was dumbfounded. I do not know what amazed me the more--the
abundance of their verbiage or the artful way in which they dressed up their
falsehoods. I gradually came to hate them. 

Yet all this had its good side; because the more I came to know the individual leaders,
or at least the propagandists, of Social Democracy, my love for my own people
increased correspondingly. Considering the Satanic skill which these evil counsellors
displayed, how could their unfortunate victims be blamed? Indeed, I found it extremely
difficult myself to be a match for the dialectical perfidy of that race. How futile it was to
try to win over such people with argument, seeing that their very mouths distorted the
truth, disowning the very words they had just used and adopting them again a few
moments afterwards to serve their own ends in the argument! No. The more I came to
know the Jew, the easier it was to excuse the workers.

In my opinion the most culpable were not to be found among the workers but rather
among those who did not think it worth while to take the trouble to sympathize with
their own kinsfolk and give to the hard-working son of the national family what was his
by the iron logic of justice, while at the same time placing his seducer and corrupter
against the wall.

Urged by my own daily experiences, I now began to investigate more thoroughly the
sources of the Marxist teaching itself. Its effects were well known to me in detail. As a
result of careful observation, its daily progress had become obvious to me. And one
needed only a little imagination in order to be able to forecast the consequences which
must result from it. The only question now was: Did the founders foresee the effects of
their work in the form which those effects have shown themselves to-day, or were the
founders themselves the victims of an error? To my mind both alternatives were
possible.

If the second question must be answered in the affirmative, then it was the duty of
every thinking person to oppose this sinister movement with a view to preventing it
from producing its worst results. But if the first question must be answered in the
affirmative, then it must be admitted that the original authors of this evil which has
infected the nations were devils incarnate. For only in the brain of a monster, and not
that of a man, could the plan of this organization take shape whose workings must
finally bring about the collapse of human civilization and turn this world into a desert
waste.

Such being the case the only alternative left was to fight, and in that fight to employ all
the weapons which the human spirit and intellect and will could furnish leaving it to
Fate to decide in whose favour the balance should fall.

And so I began to gather information about the authors of this teaching, with a view to
studying the principles of the movement. The fact that I attained my object sooner than
I could have anticipated was due to the deeper insight into the Jewish question which I
then gained, my knowledge of this question being hitherto rather superficial. This
newly acquired knowledge alone enabled me to make a practical comparison between 
the real content and the theoretical pretentiousness of the teaching laid down by the
apostolic founders of Social Democracy; because I now understood the language of the
Jew. I realized that the Jew uses language for the purpose of dissimulating his thought
or at least veiling it, so that his real aim cannot be discovered by what he says but rather
by reading between the lines. This knowledge was the occasion of the greatest inner
revolution that I had yet experienced. From being a soft-hearted cosmopolitan I became
an out-and-out anti-Semite.

Only on one further occasion, and that for the last time, did I give way to oppressing
thoughts which caused me some moments of profound anxiety.

As I critically reviewed the activities of the Jewish people throughout long periods of
history I became anxious and asked myself whether for some inscrutable reasons
beyond the comprehension of poor mortals such as ourselves, Destiny may not have
irrevocably decreed that the final victory must go to this small nation? May it not be
that this people which has lived only for the earth has been promised the earth as a
recompense? is our right to struggle for our own self-preservation based on reality, or is
it a merely subjective thing? Fate answered the question for me inasmuch as it led me to
make a detached and exhaustive inquiry into the Marxist teaching and the activities of
the Jewish people in connection with it.

The Jewish doctrine of Marxism repudiates the aristocratic principle of Nature and
substitutes for it the eternal privilege of force and energy, numerical mass and its dead
weight. Thus it denies the individual worth of the human personality, impugns the
teaching that nationhood and race have a primary significance, and by doing this it
takes away the very foundations of human existence and human civilization. If the
Marxist teaching were to be accepted as the foundation of the life of the universe, it
would lead to the disappearance of all order that is conceivable to the human mind.
And thus the adoption of such a law would provoke chaos in the structure of the
greatest organism that we know, with the result that the inhabitants of this earthly
planet would finally disappear.

Should the Jew, with the aid of his Marxist creed, triumph over the people of this world, his Crown will be the funeral wreath of mankind, and this planet will once again follow its orbit through ether, without any human life on its surface, as it did millions of years ago.

And so I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord.
