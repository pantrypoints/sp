The habit of discussing matters within such a restricted group has many advantages. 

Rather than talk at them, I learned to feel my way into the modes of thought and views of those men around me. 

Oftentimes such ways of thinking and such views were quite primitive. Thus I took every possible occasion to increase my knowledge of men. 

Vienna is the best place for this among the German people.

 <!-- was the opportunity for making such a study so favourable as in . -->

In the old Danubian Monarchy, political thought was wider in its range and had a richer variety of interests than in the Germany of that epoch--except in certain parts of Prussia, Hamburg and the districts bordering on the North Sea.

Austria here means that part of the great Habsburg Empire which led to the current Germany through:
- the German population
- cultural life in an artificial political system.

As time went on, the stability of the Austrian State more and more on the maintenance of this germ-cell of that Habsburg Empire.

The hereditary imperial provinces constituted the heart of the Empire. 

This heart constantly sent the blood of life pulsating through the whole political and cultural system. 

Corresponding to the heart of the Empire, Vienna signified the brain and the will.

Vienna is the capital of Austria. 

<!--  presented an appearance which made one think of her as an enthroned queen whose authoritative sway united the conglomeration of heterogenous nationalities that lived under the Habsburg sceptre. The radiant beauty of
the capital city made one forget the sad symptoms of senile decay which the State
manifested as a whole. -->

The Empire was internally rickety because of the terrific conflict going on between the various nationalities.

The outside world--and Germany in particular--saw only that lovely picture of the city. The illusion was all the greater because at that time Vienna seemed to have risen to its highest pitch of splendour. 

Under a Mayor, who had the true stamp of administrative genius, the venerable residential City of the Emperors of the old Empire seemed to have the glory of its youth renewed. The last great German who sprang from the ranks of the people that had colonized the East Mark was not a  'statesman', in the official sense. 

This Dr. Luegar, however, in his rôle as Mayor of 'the Imperial Capital and Residential City', had achieved so much in almost all spheres of municipal activity, whether economic or cultural, that the heart of the whole Empire throbbed with renewed vigour. He thus proved himself a much greater statesman than the so-called 'diplomats' of that period.

The fact that this political system of heterogeneous races called AUSTRIA, finally broke down is no evidence whatsoever of political incapacity on the part of the German element in the old East Mark. 

The collapse was the inevitable result of an impossible situation.

10 million people cannot permanently hold together a State of 50 million, composed of different and convicting nationalities, unless certain definite pre-requisite conditions are at hand while there is still time to avail of them.

The German-Austrian had very big ways of thinking. Accustomed to live in a great Empire, he had a keen sense of the obligations incumbent on him in such a situation. 

He was the only member of the Austrian State who looked beyond the borders of the narrow lands belonging to the Crown and took in all the frontiers of the Empire in the sweep of his mind.

When destiny severed him from the common Fatherland he tried to master the tremendous task which was set before him as a consequence. This task was to maintain for the German-Austrians that patrimony which, through innumerable struggles, their ancestors had originally wrested from the East. 

The German-Austrians could not put their undivided strength into this effort, because the hearts and minds of the best among them were constantly turning back towards their kinsfolk in the Motherland, so that only a fraction of their energy
remained to be employed at home.

The mental horizon of the German-Austrian was comparatively broad. 

His commercial interests comprised almost every section of the heterogeneous Empire. The conduct of almost all important undertakings was in his hands. 

He provided the State, for the most part, with its leading technical experts and civil servants. He was responsible for carrying on the foreign trade of the country, as far as that sphere of activity was not under Jewish control, The German-Austrian exclusively represented the political cement that held the State together. 

His military duties carried him far beyond the narrow frontiers of his homeland. Though the recruit might join a regiment made up of the German element, the regiment itself might be stationed in Herzegovina as well as in Vienna or Galicia. 

The officers in the Habsburg armies were still Germans and so was the predominating element in the higher branches of the civil service. Art and science were in German hands. 

Apart from the new artistic trash, which might easily have been produced by a negro tribe, all genuine artistic inspiration came from the German section of the population. In music, architecture, sculpture and painting, Vienna
abundantly supplied the entire Dual Monarchy. 

The source never seemed to show signs of a possible exhaustion. Finally, it was the German element that determined the 
conduct of foreign policy, though a small number of Hungarians were also active in that
field.

All efforts, however, to save the unity of the State were doomed to end in failure, because the essential pre-requisites were missing.

There was only one possible way to control and hold in check the centrifugal forces of the different and differing nationalities. This way was: to govern the Austrian State and organize it internally on the principle of centralization. In no other way imaginable could the existence of that State be assured.

Now and again there were lucid intervals in the higher ruling quarters when this truth was recognized. But it was soon forgotten again, or else deliberately ignored, because of the difficulties to be overcome in putting it into practice. Every project which aimed at giving the Empire a more federal shape was bound to be ineffective because there was no strong central authority which could exercise sufficient power within the State to hold the federal elements together. It must be remembered in this connection that conditions in Austria were quite different from those which characterized the German State as founded by Bismarck. Germany was faced with only one difficulty, which was that of transforming the purely political traditions, because throughout the whole of Bismarck's Germany there was a common cultural basis. The German Empire contained only members of one and the same racial or national stock, with the exception of a few
minor foreign fragments.

Demographic conditions in Austria were quite the reverse. With the exception of Hungary there was no political tradition, coming down from a great past, in any of the various affiliated countries. If there had been, time had either wiped out all traces of it, or at least, rendered them obscure. Moreover, this was the epoch when the principle of nationality began to be in ascendant; and that phenomenon awakened the national instincts in the various countries affiliated under the Habsburg sceptre. 

It was difficult to control the action of these newly awakened national forces; because, adjacent to the frontiers of the Dual Monarchy, new national States were springing up whose people were of the same or kindred racial stock as the respective nationalities that constituted the Habsburg Empire. These new States were able to exercise a greater influence than the German element.

Even Vienna could not hold out for a lengthy period in this conflict. 

When Budapest had developed into a metropolis a rival had grown up whose mission was, not to help
in holding together the various divergent parts of the Empire, but rather to strengthen
one part. 

Within a short time, Prague followed the example of Budapest, followed by Lemberg, Laibach and others.

By raising these places which had formerly been provincial towns to the rank of national cities, rallying centres were provided for an independent cultural life. 

Through this the local national instincts acquired a spiritual  foundation and therewith gained a more profound hold on the people. The time was bound to come when the particularist interests of those various countries would
become stronger than their common imperial interests. Once that stage had been
reached, Austria's doom was sealed.

The course of this development was clearly perceptible since the death of Joseph II. Its
rapidity depended on a number of factors, some of which had their source in the
Monarchy itself; while others resulted from the position which the Empire had taken in
foreign politics.

It was impossible to make anything like a successful effort for the permanent consolidation of the Austrian State unless a firm and persistent policy of centralization were put into force. Before everything else the principle should have been adopted that only one common language could be used as the official language of the State. Thus it
would be possible to emphasize the formal unity of that imperial commonwealth. 

Thus, the administration would have in its hands a technical instrument without which the State could not endure as a political unity. In the same way the school and other forms of education should have been used to inculcate a feeling of common citizenship. 

Such an objective could not be reached within ten or twenty years. The effort would
have to be envisaged in terms of centuries; just as in all problems of colonization, steady
perseverance is a far more important element than the output of energetic effort at the
moment.

It goes without saying that in such circumstances the country must be governed and
administered by strictly adhering to the principle of uniformity.
For me it was quite instructive to discover why this did not take place, or rather why it
was not done. Those who were guilty of the omission must be held responsible for the
break-up of the Habsburg Empire.

More than any other State, the existence of the old Austria depended on a strong and
capable Government. The Habsburg Empire lacked ethnical uniformity, which constitutes the fundamental basis of a national State and will preserve the existence of such a State even though the ruling power should be grossly inefficient. When a State is composed of a homogeneous population, the natural inertia of such a population will hold the Stage together and maintain its existence through astonishingly long periods of misgovernment and maladministration. It may often seem as if the principle of life had died out in such a body-politic; but a time comes when the apparent corpse rises up and
displays before the world an astonishing manifestation of its indestructible vitality.


But the situation is utterly different in a country where the population is not homogeneous, where there is no bond of common blood but only that of one ruling hand. Should the ruling hand show signs of weakness in such a State the result will not be to cause a kind of hibernation of the State but rather to awaken the individualist
instincts which are slumbering in the ethnological groups. These instincts do not make
themselves felt as long as these groups are dominated by a strong central will-togovern. The danger which exists in these slumbering separatist instincts can be rendered more or less innocuous only through centuries of common education,
common traditions and common interests.

The younger such States are, the more their existence will depend on the ability and strength of the central government. If their foundation was due only to the work of a strong personality or a leader who is a man of
genius, in many cases they will break up as soon as the founder disappears; because,
though great, he stood alone. But even after centuries of a common education and
experiences these separatist instincts I have spoken of are not always completely
overcome. They may be only dormant and may suddenly awaken when the central
government shows weakness and the force of a common education as well as the
prestige of a common tradition prove unable to withstand the vital energies of
separatist nationalities forging ahead towards the shaping of their own individual
existence.
