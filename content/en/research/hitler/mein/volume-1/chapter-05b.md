The War of 1914 was certainly not forced on the masses; it was even desired by the whole people.

People wanted to end the feeling of uncertainty once and for all. This is why over 2 million German men and youths voluntarily joined the fight.

<!-- For me these hours came as a deliverance from the distress that had weighed upon me
during the days of my youth. I am not ashamed to acknowledge to-day that I was
carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment and that I sank down upon my knees
and thanked Heaven out of the fullness of my heart for the favour of having been
permitted to live in such a time. -->

<!-- The fight for freedom had broken out on an unparalleled scale in the history of the world. From the moment that Fate took the helm in hand the conviction grew among the mass of the people that now it was not a question of deciding the destinies of Austria or Serbia but that the very existence of the German nation itself was at stake. -->

At last, after many years of blindness, the people saw clearly into the future. Therefore, almost immediately after the gigantic struggle had begun, an excessive enthusiasm was replaced by a more earnest and more fitting undertone, because the exaltation of the popular spirit was not a mere passing frenzy.

It was only too necessary that the gravity of the situation should be recognized.

At that time there was, generally speaking, not the slightest presentiment or conception of how long the war might last. 

People dreamed of the soldiers being home by Christmas and that then they would resume their daily work in peace.

Whatever mankind desires, that it will hope for and believe in. 

The overwhelming majority of the people had long since grown weary of the perpetual insecurity in the public affairs. Hence, no one believed that the Austro-Serbian conflict could be shelved. 

Therefore they, including myself, looked forward to the war. 

<!--  a radical settlement of accounts. 

I also belonged to the millions that desired this.   -->

The moment the news of the Sarajevo outrage reached Munich 2 ideas came into my mind:

1. War was inevitable
2. The Habsburg State would now be forced to honour its signature to the alliance

For what I had feared most was that one day Germany herself, perhaps as a result of the Alliance, would become
involved in a conflict the first direct cause of which did not affect Austria. 

In such a contingency, I feared that the Austrian State, for domestic political reasons, would find itself unable to decide in favour of its ally. But now this danger was removed. The old State was compelled to fight, whether it wished to do so or not.

My own attitude towards the conflict was equally simple and clear. 

I believed that it was not a case of Austria fighting to get satisfaction from Serbia but rather a case of
Germany fighting for her own existence--the German nation for its own to-be-or-not-tobe, for its freedom and for its future. The work of Bismarck must now be carried on.

Young Germany must show itself worthy of the blood shed by our fathers on so many heroic fields of battle, from Weissenburg to Sedan and Paris. 

If this struggle should bring us victory our people will again rank foremost among the great nations. Only then could the German Empire assert itself as the mighty champion of peace, without the necessity of restricting the daily bread of its children for the sake of maintaining the peace.

<!-- As a boy and as a young man, I often longed for the occasion to prove that my national
enthusiasm was not mere vapouring. Hurrahing sometimes seemed to me to be a kind
of sinful indulgence, though I could not give any justification for that feeling; for, after
all, who has the right to shout that triumphant word if he has not won the right to it
there where there is no play-acting and where the hand of the Goddess of Destiny puts
the truth and sincerity of nations and men through her inexorable test? Just as millions
of others, I felt a proud joy in being permitted to go through this test. I had so often
sung DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES and so often roared 'HEIL' that I now thought it
was as a kind of retro-active grace that I was granted the right of appearing before the
Court of Eternal Justice to testify to the truth of those sentiments.
One thing was clear to me from the very beginning, namely, that in the event of war,
which now seemed inevitable, my books would have to be thrown aside forthwith. I
also realized that my place would have to be there where the inner voice of conscience
called me. -->



I had left Austria for political reasons. I had no desire to fight for the Habsburg cause. But I was prepared to die at any time for my own kinsfolk and the Empire to which they really belonged. 

On August 3, 1914, I presented an urgent petition to King Ludwig 3rd asking to serve in a Bavarian regiment. It was granted. 

<!-- In those days the Chancellery had its hands quite full and therefore I was all the more pleased when I received the
answer a day later, that my request had been granted. 

I opened the document with
trembling hands; and no words of mine could now describe the satisfaction I felt on
reading that I was instructed to report to a Bavarian regiment.  -->

Within a few days I was wearing that uniform which I was not to put oft again for nearly six years.

For me, as for every German, the most memorable period of my life now began. Face to
face with that mighty struggle, all the past fell away into oblivion. 

With a wistful pride I look back on those days, especially because we are now approaching the tenth
anniversary of that memorable happening.

I recall those early weeks of war when kind fortune permitted me to take my place in that heroic struggle among the nations. 

<!-- As the scene unfolds itself before my mind, it seems only like yesterday. I see myself among my young comrades on our first parade drill, and so on until at last the day came on which we were to leave for the front. -->

Like others, I feared that we might arrive too late for the fighting at the front.

Time and again that thought disturbed me and every announcement of a victorious engagement left a bitter taste, which
increased as the news of further victories arrived.

At long last the day came when we left Munich on war service. I saw the Rhine for the first time.

<!--  in my
life , as we journeyed westwards to stand guard before that historic
German river against its traditional and grasping enemy. As the first soft rays of the
morning sun broke through the light mist and disclosed to us the Niederwald Statue,
with one accord the whole troop train broke into the strains of DIE WACHT AM
RHEIN. I then felt as if my heart could not contain its spirit. -->

And then followed a damp, cold night in Flanders. We marched in silence throughout the night and as the morning sun came through the mist an iron greeting suddenly burst above our heads. 

Shrapnel exploded in our midst and spluttered in the damp ground. But before the smoke of the explosion disappeared a wild 'Hurrah' was shouted from two hundred throats, in response to this first greeting of Death.

Then began the whistling of bullets and the booming of cannons, the shouting and singing of the combatants. With eyes straining feverishly, we pressed forward, quicker and quicker, until we finally came to close-quarter fighting, there beyond the beet-fields and the meadows.

Soon the strains of a song reached us from afar. Nearer and nearer, from company to company, it came. And while Death began to make havoc in our ranks we passed the song on to those beside us: DEUTSCHLAND, DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER
ALLES, ÜBER ALLES IN DER WELT. 

After four days in the trenches we came back. Even our step was no longer what it had been. Boys of seventeen looked now like grown men. The rank and file of the List Regiment (Note 11) had not been properly trained in the art of warfare, but they knew how to die like old soldiers.

That was the beginning. And thus we carried on from year to year. A feeling of horror
replaced the romantic fighting spirit.

Enthusiasm cooled down gradually by the fear of the ever-present Death. A time came when there arose within each one of us a conflict between the urge to self-preservation and the call
of duty. 

I had to go through that conflict too. As Death sought its prey everywhere and unrelentingly a nameless Something rebelled within the weak body and tried to introduce itself under the name of Common Sense; but in reality it was Fear, which had
taken on this cloak in order to impose itself on the individual. 

But the more the voice which advised prudence increased its efforts and the more clear and persuasive became
its appeal, resistance became all the stronger; until finally the internal strife was over
and the call of duty was triumphant. Already in the winter of 1915-16 I had come
through that inner struggle. 

The will had asserted its incontestable mastery. Whereas in the early days I went into the fight with a cheer and a laugh, I was now habitually calm and resolute.

<!-- That frame of mind endured. Fate might now put me through the
final test without my nerves or reason giving way. The young volunteer had become an
old soldier. -->

This same transformation took place throughout the whole army. Constant fighting had aged and toughened it and hardened it, so that it stood firm and dauntless against every assault.

Only now was it possible to judge that army. After two and three years of continuous fighting, having been thrown into one battle after another, standing up stoutly against superior numbers and superior armament, suffering hunger and privation, the time had come when one could assess the value of that singular fighting force.

For a thousand years to come nobody will dare to speak of heroism without recalling the German Army of the World War. And then from the dim past will emerge the immortal vision of those solid ranks of steel helmets that never flinched and never
faltered. 

And as long as Germans live they will be proud to remember that these men were the sons of their forefathers.

I was then a soldier and did not wish to meddle in politics, all the more so because the
time was inopportune. 

I still believe that the most modest stable-boy of those days served his country better than the best of, let us say, the 'parliamentary deputies'. My hatred for those footlers was never greater than in those days when all decent men who
had anything to say said it point-blank in the enemy's face; or, failing this, kept their mouths shut and did their duty elsewhere. 

I despised those political fellows and if I had  had my way I would have formed them into a Labour Battalion and given them the opportunity of babbling amongst themselves to their hearts' content, without offence or harm to decent people.

In those days I cared nothing for politics; but I could not help forming an opinion on certain manifestations which affected not only the whole nation but also us soldiers in particular. There were two things which caused me the greatest anxiety at that time and which I had come to regard as detrimental to our interests.

<!-- Shortly after our first series of victories a certain section of the Press already began to
throw cold water, drip by drip, on the enthusiasm of the public. At first this was not
obvious to many people. It was done under the mask of good intentions and a spirit of
anxious care. The public was told that big celebrations of victories were somewhat out
of place and were not worthy expressions of the spirit of a great nation. The fortitude
and valour of German soldiers were accepted facts which did not necessarily call for
outbursts of celebration. Furthermore, it was asked, what would foreign opinion have
to say about these manifestations? Would not foreign opinion react more favourably to
a quiet and sober form of celebration rather than to all this wild jubilation? -->

<!-- Surely the time had come--so the Press declared--for us Germans to remember that this war was
not our work and that hence there need be no feeling of shame in declaring our
willingness to do our share towards effecting an understanding among the nations. For
this reason it would not be wise to sully the radiant deeds of our army with
unbecoming jubilation; for the rest of the world would never understand this.
Furthermore, nothing is more appreciated than the modesty with which a true hero
quietly and unassumingly carries on and forgets. Such was the gist of their warning.
Instead of catching these fellows by their long ears and dragging them to some ditch
and looping a cord around their necks, so that the victorious enthusiasm of the nation
should no longer offend the aesthetic sensibilities of these knights of the pen, a general
Press campaign was now allowed to go on against what was called 'unbecoming' and
'undignified' forms of victorious celebration. -->

No one seemed to have the faintest idea that when public enthusiasm is once damped, nothing can enkindle it again, when the necessity arises. This enthusiasm is an intoxication and must be kept up in that form. Without the support of this enthusiastic spirit how would it be possible to endure in a struggle which, according to human standards, made such immense demands on the spiritual stamina of the nation? 

I was only too well acquainted with the psychology of the broad masses not to know that in such cases a magnaminous 'aestheticism' cannot fan the fire which is needed to keep the iron hot. In my eyes it was even a mistake not to have tried to raise the pitch of public enthusiasm still higher. Therefore I could not at all understand why the contrary
policy was adopted, that is to say, the policy of damping the public spirit. 

Another thing which irritated me was the manner in which Marxism was regarded and accepted. I thought that all this proved how little they knew about the Marxist plague. It was believed in all seriousness that the abolition of party distinctions during the War had made Marxism a mild and moderate thing.

But here there was no question of party. There was question of a doctrine which was being expounded for the express purpose of leading humanity to its destruction. The purport of this doctrine was not understood because nothing was said about that side of the question in our Jew-ridden universities and because our supercilious bureaucratic officials did not think it worth while to read up a subject which had not been prescribed in their university course. This mighty revolutionary trend was going on beside them; 

But those 'intellectuals' would not deign to give it their attention. That is why State enterprise nearly always lags behind private enterprise. Of these gentry once can truly say that their maxim is: What we don't know won't bother us. In the August of 1914 the German worker was looked upon as an adherent of Marxist socialism. That was a gross error. 

When those fateful hours dawned the German worker shook off the poisonous clutches of that plague; otherwise he would not have been so willing and ready to fight. 

People were stupid enough to imagine that Marxism had now become 'national', another apt illustration of the fact that those in authority had never taken the trouble to study the real tenor of the Marxist teaching. If they had done so, such foolish errors would not have been committed.
