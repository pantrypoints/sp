In August and September, the symptoms of moral disintegration increased more rapidly, although the enemy's offensive was not at all comparable to the frightfulness of our own former defensive battles. 

In comparison with this offensive the battles fought on the Somme and in Flanders remained in our memories as the most terrible of all horrors. 

At the end of September my division occupied, for the third time, those positions which we had once taken by storm as young volunteers. What a memory!

Here we had received our baptism of fire, in October and November 1914. 

<!-- With a burning love of the homeland in their hearts and a song on their lips, our young regiment went into action as if going to a dance. The dearest blood was given freely
here in the belief that it was shed to protect the freedom and independence of the
Fatherland. -->

In July 1917 we set foot for the second time on what we regarded as sacred soil. 

<!-- Were not our best comrades at rest here, some of them little more than boys--the soldiers who had rushed into death for their country's sake, their eyes glowing with enthusiastic love. -->

The older ones among us, who had been with the regiment from the beginning, were deeply moved as we stood on this sacred spot where we had sworn 'Loyalty and Duty unto Death'. 

Three years ago the regiment had taken this position by storm; now it was called upon to defend it in a gruelling struggle.

With a 3-week artillery bombardment, the English prepared for their great offensive in Flanders. There the spirits of the dead seemed to live again. 

The regiment dug itself into the mud, clung to its shell-holes and craters, neither flinching nor wavering, but growing smaller in numbers day after day. Finally the British launched their attack on July 31, 1917.

We were relieved in the beginning of August. The regiment had dwindled down to a few companies, who staggered back, mud-crusted, more like phantoms than human beings. Besides a few hundred yards of shell-holes, death was the only reward which the English gained.

Now in the autumn of 1918 we stood for the third time on the ground we had stormed in 1914. 

The village of Comines, which formerly had served us as a base, was now within the fighting zone. Although little had changed in the surrounding district itself, yet the men had become different, somehow or other. They now talked politics. 

<!-- Like everywhere else, the poison from home was having its effect here also.  -->

The young drafts succumbed to it completely. They had come directly from home.

During the night of October 13th-14th, the British opened an attack with gas on the front south of Ypres. They used the yellow gas whose effect was unknown to us, at least from personal experience. 

I was destined to experience it that very night. On a hill south of Werwick, in the evening of October 13th, we were subjected for several hours to a heavy bombardment with gas bombs, which continued throughout the night.

About midnight a number of us were put out of action, some forever. 

Towards morning I also began to feel pain. It increased with every quarter of an hour;

At 7am my eyes were scorching as I staggered back and delivered the last dispatch I was destined to carry in this war. A few hours later my eyes were like glowing coals and all was darkness around me.

I was sent into hospital at Pasewalk in Pomerania where I had to hear of the Revolution.

<!-- For a long time there had been something in the air which was indefinable and
repulsive. People were saying that something was bound to happen within the next few
weeks, although I could not imagine what this meant.  -->

In the first instance I thought of a strike similar to the one which had taken place in spring. Unfavourable rumours were constantly coming from the Navy, which was said to be in a state of ferment. But this seemed to be a fanciful creation of a few isolated young people. 

At the hospital, they were all talking abut the end of the war and hoping that this was not far off. But nobody thought that the decision would come immediately. I was not able to read the newspapers.

In November the general tension increased. Then one day disaster broke in upon us suddenly and without warning. 

Sailors came in motor-lorries and called on us to rise in revolt. A few Jew-boys were the leaders in that combat for the 'Liberty, Beauty, and Dignity' of our National Being. Not one of them had seen active service at the front.

Through the medium of a hospital for venereal diseases these three Orientals had been sent back home. Now their red rags were being hoisted here. During the last few days I had begun to feel somewhat better. The burning pain in the eye-sockets had become less severe. 

Gradually I was able to distinguish the general outlines of my immediate surroundings. And it was permissible to hope that at least I would recover my sight sufficiently to be able to take up some profession later on. That I would ever be able to draw or design once again was naturally out of the question. Thus I was on the way to recovery when the frightful hour came.

My first thought was that this outbreak of high treason was only a local affair. I tried to enforce this belief among my comrades. My Bavarian hospital mates, in particular, were readily responsive. 

Their inclinations were anything but revolutionary. I could not imagine this madness breaking out in Munich; for it seemed to me that loyalty to the House of Wittelsbach was, after all, stronger than the will of a few Jews.

I could not help believing that this was merely a revolt in the Navy and that it would be suppressed within the next few days.

The rumours grew more and more persistent. I was told that what I had considered to be a local affair  was in reality a general revolution. 

In addition to this, from the front came the shameful news that they wished to capitulate! Was such a thing possible?

On November 10th the local pastor visited the hospital to deliver a short address. And that was how we came to know the whole story. 

He told us that the House of Hohen-zollern should no longer wear the Imperial Crown, that the Fatherland had become a 'Republic'.

<!-- , that we should pray to the Almighty not to withhold His blessing from the new order of
things and not to abandon our people in the days to come. In delivering this message he
could not do more than briefly express appreciation of the Royal House, its services to
Pomerania, to Prussia, indeed, to the whole of the German Fatherland, and--here he
began to weep. A feeling of profound dismay fell on the people in that assembly, and I
do not think there was a single eye that withheld its tears.  -->

Everyone cried including me. 

<!-- As for myself, I broke down
completely when the old gentleman tried to resume his story by informing us that we
must now end this long war, because the war was lost, he said, and we were at the
mercy of the victor. The Fatherland would have to bear heavy burdens in the future. We
were to accept the terms of the Armistice and trust to the magnanimity of our former
enemies. It was impossible for me to stay and listen any longer. Darkness surrounded
me as I staggered and stumbled back to my ward and buried my aching head between
the blankets and pillow. -->

<!-- I had not cried since the day that I stood beside my mother's grave. Whenever Fate dealt
cruelly with me in my young days the spirit of determination within me grew stronger
and stronger. During all those long years of war, when Death claimed many a true
friend and comrade from our ranks, to me it would have appeared sinful to have
uttered a word of complaint. Did they not die for Germany? And, finally, almost in the
last few days of that titanic struggle, when the waves of poison gas enveloped me and
began to penetrate my eyes, the thought of becoming permanently blind unnerved me;
but the voice of conscience cried out immediately: Poor miserable fellow, will you start
howling when there are thousands of others whose lot is a hundred times worse than
yours? And so I accepted my misfortune in silence, realizing that this was the only thing
to be done and that personal suffering was nothing when compared with the
misfortune of one's country. -->

So all had been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and privations, in vain the hunger and thirst for endless months, in vain those hours that we stuck to our posts though the fear of death gripped our souls, and in vain the deaths of two millions who fell in discharging this duty. 

<!-- Think of those hundreds of thousands who set out with hearts full of faith in their fatherland, and never returned; ought not their graves to open, so that the spirits of those heroes bespattered with mud and blood should come home and
take vengeance on those who had so despicably betrayed the greatest sacrifice which a 
human being can make for his country? 

Was it for this that the soldiers died in August and September 1914, for this that the volunteer regiments followed the old comrades in the autumn of the same year? Was it for this that those boys of seventeen years of age
were mingled with the earth of Flanders? Was this meant to be the fruits of the sacrifice
which German mothers made for their Fatherland when, with heavy hearts, they said
good-bye to their sons who never returned? Has all this been done in order to enable a
gang of despicable criminals to lay hands on the Fatherland?

Was this then what the German soldier struggled for through sweltering heat and
blinding snowstorm, enduring hunger and thirst and cold, fatigued from sleepless
nights and endless marches? Was it for this that he lived through an inferno of artillery
bombardments, lay gasping and choking during gas attacks, neither flinching nor
faltering, but remaining staunch to the thought of defending the Fatherland against the
enemy? Certainly these heroes also deserved the epitaph:

Traveller, when you come to Germany, tell the Homeland that we lie here, true to the
Fatherland and faithful to our duty. (Note 13) [Note 13. Here again we have the
defenders of Thermopylae recalled as the prototype of German valour in the Great War.
Hitler's quotation is a German variant of the couplet inscribed on the monument erected
at Thermopylae to the memory of Leonidas and his Spartan soldiers who fell defending
the Pass. As given by Herodotus, who claims that he saw the inscription himself, the
original text may be literally translated thus:

Go, tell the Spartans, thou who passeth by, That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.]
And at Home? But--was this the only sacrifice that we had to consider? Was the
Germany of the past a country of little worth? Did she not owe a certain duty to her
own history? Were we still worthy to partake in the glory of the past? How could we
justify this act to future generations?
What a gang of despicable and depraved criminals!

The more I tried then to glean some definite information of the terrible events that had
happened the more my head became afire with rage and shame. What was all the pain I
suffered in my eyes compared with this tragedy?
The following days were terrible to bear, and the nights still worse. To depend on the
mercy of the enemy was a precept which only fools or criminal liars could recommend.
During those nights my hatred increased--hatred for the orignators of this dastardly
crime. -->

During the following days my own fate became clear to me. I was forced now to scoff at the thought of my personal future, which hitherto had been the cause of so much worry to me.

Was it not ludicrous to think of building up anything on such a foundation?

Finally, it also became clear to me that it was the inevitable that had happened, something which I had feared for a long time, though I really did not have the heart to believe it.

Emperor William II was the first German Emperor to offer the hand of friendship to the Marxist leaders, not suspecting that they were scoundrels without any sense of honour. 

While they held the imperial hand in theirs, the other hand was already feeling for the dagger.

There is no such thing as coming to an understanding with the Jews. It must be the hard-and-fast 'Either-Or.' For my part I then decided that I would take up political work.
