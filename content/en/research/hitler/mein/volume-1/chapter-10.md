THE DEPTH of a fall is the difference between the original height and where it has fallen. Only the profound decline or collapse of what reached extraordinary heights can strike the eye of the beholder.

The same holds for Nations and States. 

<!-- The matter of greatest importance here is the height of the original level, or rather the greatest height that had been attained before the descent began. -->

The collapse of the Second REICH was all the more bewildering because it fell from a great height to these days of misery and humiliation.

<!-- The Second REICH was founded in circumstances of such dazzling splendour that the whole nation had become entranced and exalted by it. 

Following an unparalleled series of victories, that Empire was handed over as the guerdon of immortal heroism to the children and grandchildren of the heroes.  -->

<!-- Whether they were fully conscious of it or not does not matter; anyhow, the Germans felt that this Empire had not been brought into existence by a series of able political negotiations through parliamentary channels, but that it was different from political institutions founded elsewhere by reason of the nobler circumstances that had accompanied its establishment. When its foundations were laid the accompanying music was not the chatter of parliamentary debates but the
thunder and boom of war along the battle front that encircled Paris.  -->

An act of statesmanship was accomplished whereby the Germans, princes as well as people, established the future REICH and restored the symbol of the Imperial Crown.

Bismarck's State was founded by the regiments that had fought at the front.
- This unique birth and baptism of fire gave the Second Empire historical splendour that most of the older States did not have.
<!-- What an ascension then began! A position of independence in regard to the outside world guaranteed the means of livelihood at home.  -->
- Germany increased in numbers and in worldly wealth. 
- The honour of the State and the people were secured and protected by an army
  - That army was the most striking difference between this new REICH and the old German Confederation. 

The downfall of the Second Empire and the German people has been so profound.*

{{< n n="The collapse was profound just as the collapse of imperial Japan was profound. This was because Japan and Germany were in a Warrior-Thinker (Military-Aristocratic) phase, while the world was in a Trader-Worker (Oligarch-Democrat) phase which was superior to the latter. In other words, Germany and Japan were **behind the curve**. The best solution is to join the Trader phase. This is exactly what Japan and Germany did in the 1960s by competing in terms of electronic products and industrial equipment instead.">}}


 <!-- that they all seem to have been struck dumbfounded and rendered incapable of feeling the significance of this downfall or reflecting on it. -->

<!-- It seems as if people were utterly unable to picture in their minds the heights to which the Empire formerly attained, so visionary and unreal appears the greatness and splendour of those days in contrast to the misery of the present. 

Bearing this in mind we can understand why and how people become so dazed when they try to look back to the sublime past that  -->

The Germans forgot to look for the symptoms of the great collapse.

 <!-- which must certainly have been present in some form or other.  -->

Those symptoms were in the Germans who for whom Germany was more than merely a place of abode and a source of livelihood. 

<!-- Naturally this applies only to those  -->

<!-- These are the only people who have been able to feel the present conditions as really catastrophic, whereas others have considered these conditions as the fulfilment of what they had looked forward to and hitherto silently wished.

The symptoms of future collapse were definitely to be perceived in those earlier days, although very few made any attempt to draw a practical lesson from their significance. 

But this is now a greater necessity than it ever was before. For just as  -->

Bodily ailments can be cured only when their origin has been diagnosed. Political disease can be treated only when it has been diagnosed. 

<!-- It is obvious of course that the external symptoms of any disease can be more readily detected than its internal causes, for these symptoms strike the eye more easily. 

This is also the reason why so many people recognize only external effects and mistake them for causes. Indeed they will sometimes try to deny the existence of such causes. 

That is why the  -->

Most Germans recognize the German collapse only in the **prevailing economic distress** and the results that have followed therefrom. 

<!-- Almost everyone has to carry his share of this burden, and that is why each one looks on the economic catastrophe as the cause of the present deplorable state of affairs.  -->

The broad masses see little of the cultural, political, and moral background of this collapse. 

Many of them completely lack both the necessary feeling and powers of understanding for it.

<!-- That the masses of the people should thus estimate the causes of Germany's downfall is quite understandable. But the fact that  -->

Intelligent Germans regard the German collapse primarily as an economic catastrophe, and consequently think that its cure requires an economic solution is why no improvement has been brought about. 

Economics plays only a second or third role. The main part is played by political*, moral and racial factors. 

{{< n n="The economic cause of the collapse matches our assertion that Germany was out of line with the Oligarchic (commercial) times. As of 2024, Russia has been able to prepare for this reality better by allying with China which is a commercial powerhouse. In constrast, none of Germany's 1914 allies were good commercially. This is why Hitler is correct in pointing Germany's alliances as being the cause of the error and is why he tried to ally with England, a commercial powerhouse, in his opposition to the Soviets. <p>Hitler is has enough intuition to discover that politics is always superior to economics. However, it was the role of politics to make the correct trade deals and economic alliances, something that 1914 Germany failed in, but 2024 Russia seems to be doing better.</p>">}}

<!-- Only when this is understood will it be possible to understand the causes of the present evil and consequently to find the ways and means of remedying them. 

Therefore the question of why Germany really collapsed is one of the most urgent significance, especially for  -->

This is important for a political movement which aims at overcoming this disaster. 

<!-- In scrutinizing the past with a view to discovering the causes of the German break-up, it is necessary to be careful lest we may be unduly impressed by external results that readily strike the eye and thus ignore the less manifest causes of these results.

The most facile, and therefore the most generally accepted, way of accounting for  -->

Our present misfortune is said to be the result of a lost war. But this is absurd. 


<!-- , and that this is the real cause of the present misfortune. Probably there are many who honestly believe in this absurd explanation but there are many more in whose mouths it is a deliberate and conscious falsehood. 

This applies to all those who are now feeding at the Government troughs. For the prophets of  -->

Those who started the 1918 Revolution declared that:
- it would be immaterial to the great masses what the result of the War might be.
- there would be a resurgence of the German people once 'militarism' had been crushed.

<!-- On the contrary, they solemnly assured the public that it was High Finance which was principally interested in a victorious outcome of this gigantic struggle among the nations but that the German people and the German workers had no interest whatsoever in such an outcome. 

The apostles of world conciliation habitually asserted that, far from any German downfall, the opposite was bound to take place--namely, 

Did not these self-same circles sing the praises of the Entente and did they not also lay the whole blame for the sanguinary struggle on the shoulders of Germany? Without this explanation, would they have been able to put forward the theory that a military defeat would have no political consequences for the German people? 

Was not the whole Revolution dressed up in gala colours as blocking the victorious advance of the German banners and that thus the German people would be assured its liberty both at home and abroad?

Is not that so, you miserable, lying rascals?  -->

That kind of impudence is typical of the Jews. 

They proclaim that the defeat of the army as the cause of the German collapse. The Berlin VORWÄRTS, that organ and mouthpiece of sedition then wrote that the Germany should not be permitted to bring home its banners triumphantly. 

Yet they attribute our collapse to the military defeat*.

{{< n n="The German government probably did not foresee that the peace terms would be so economically harsh on Germany especially since they were not defeated in the war so easily. But this is more proof that the German mentality was not in sync with the modern Oligarchic times.">}}

<!-- Of course it would be out of the question to enter into an argument with these liars who deny at one moment what they said the moment before. I should waste no further words on them were it not for the fact that there are many thoughtless people who repeat all this in parrot fashion, without being necessarily inspired by any evil motives. -->

My observations are meant for our fighting followers, seeing that nowadays one's spoken words are often forgotten and twisted in their meaning.  

I assert that the loss of the War was not the cause of the German collapse.

<!-- It is admittedly a fact that the loss of the War was of tragic importance for the future of our country. But that loss was not in itself a cause.  -->

Rather, the loss of the War was just an effect of the Germans who collaborated against Germany.  

<!--  consequence of other causes. That a disastrous ending to this life-or-death conflict must have involved catastrophes in its train was clearly seen by everyone of insight who could think in a straightforward manner. 

But unfortunately there were also people whose powers of understanding seemed to fail them at that critical moment. And there were other people who had first questioned that truth and then altogether denied it. 

There were people who, after their secret desire had been fulfilled, were suddenly faced with the subsequent facts that resulted from their own collaboration. Such people are responsible for the collapse, and not the lost war, though they now want to attribute everything to this.  -->

<!-- The loss of the War was a result of their activities and not the result of bad leadership as they now would like to maintain.  -->

Our enemies were not cowards. The organization and leadership of the German Army was the mightiest that the world has ever seen. 

<!-- They also know how to die. From the very first day of the War they outnumbered the German Army, and the arsenals and armament factories of the whole world were at their disposal for the replenishment of military equipment. Indeed it is universally admitted that the German victories, which had been steadily won during four years of warfare against the whole world, were due to superior leadership, apart of course from the heroism of the troops. And the organization was solely due to the German military leadership.  -->




<!-- Any shortcomings which became evident were humanly unavoidable. The collapse of that army was not the cause of our present distress. It was itself the consequence of other faults. 

But this consequence in its turn ushered in a further collapse, which was more visible. That such was actually the case can be shown as follows:

Must a military defeat necessarily lead to such a complete overthrow of the State and Nation? Whenever has this been the result of an unlucky war? 

As a matter of fact, are nations ever ruined by a lost war and by that alone? The answer to this question can be briefly stated by referring to the fact that military defeats are the result of internal decay, cowardice, want of character, and are a retribution for such things. 

If such were not the causes then a military defeat would lead to a national resurgence and bring the nation to a higher pitch of effort. A military defeat is not the tombstone of national life. 

History affords innumerable examples to confirm the truth of that statement. 


Unfortunately Germany's military overthrow was not an undeserved catastrophe, but a well-merited punishment which was in the nature of an eternal retribution. This defeat was more than deserved by us; for it represented the greatest external phenomenon of decomposition among a series of internal phenomena, which, although they were  visible, were not recognized by the majority of the people, who follow the tactics of the ostrich and see only what they want to see.

Let us examine the symptoms that were evident in Germany at the time that the German people accepted this defeat. Is it not true that  -->

In several circles, the misfortunes of the Fatherland were even joyfully welcomed. 

<!-- Who could act in such a way without thereby meriting vengeance for his attitude? Were there not people who even went further and boasted that they had gone to the extent of weakening the front and causing a collapse? Therefore it was not the enemy who brought this disgrace upon our shoulders but rather our own countrymen. 

If they suffered misfortune for it afterwards, was that misfortune undeserved? Was there ever a case in history where a people declared itself guilty of a war, and that even against its better conscience and its better knowledge?

No, and again no. In the manner in which the German nation reacted to its defeat we can see that the real cause of our collapse must be looked for elsewhere and not in the purely military loss of a few positions or the failure of an offensive.  -->

If the front had given way and thus brought about a national disaster, then the German nation would have accepted the defeat in another spirit. 
- They would have borne the subsequent misfortune with clenched teeth, or they would have been overwhelmed by sorrow. 

<!-- Regret and fury would have filled their hearts against an enemy into whose hands victory had been given by a chance event or the decree of Fate; and in that case the nation, following the example of the Roman Senate (Note 14), would have faced the defeated legions on their return and expressed their thanks for the sacrifices that had been made and would have requested them not to lose faith in the Empire. 

Even the capitulation would have been signed under the sway of calm reason, while the heart would have beaten in the hope of the coming REVANCHE. 

That is the reception that would have been given to a military defeat which had to be attributed only to the adverse decree of Fortune. There would have been neither joymaking nor dancing. Cowardice would not have been boasted of, and the defeat would not have been honoured. On returning from the Front, the troops would not have been mocked at, and the colours would not have been dragged in the dust. 
 -->

But in reality that disgraceful state of affairs arose that induced a British officer, Colonel Repington, to declare with scorn: Every third German is a traitor! 

<!-- No, in such a case this plague would never have assumed the proportions of a veritable flood which, for the past five years, has smothered every vestige of respect for the German nation in the outside world. -->

This shows only too clearly how false it is to say that the loss of the War was the cause of the German break-up. No. The military defeat was itself but the consequence of a whole series of morbid symptoms and their causes which had become active in the German nation before the War broke out. 

The War was the first catastrophal consequence of how:
- traditions and national morale had been poisoned and 
- the instinct of self-preservation had degenerated. 

These were the preliminary causes which for many years had been undermining the foundations of the nation and the Empire.

But it remained for:
- the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood,  , 
- the Marxists, the fighting comrades of the Jews

 <!-- to impute responsibility for the downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown a superhuman will and energy in his effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. -->

They blamed the loss of the world war on Ludendorff -- the only adversary likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice.

<!-- All this was inspired by the principle--which is quite true in itself--that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their
emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily.

Thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to largescale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.

Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes. -->


From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited.

Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, whereas in reality they are a race? 

What a race! 

One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. Schopenhauer called the Jew "The Great Master of Lies". 

<!-- Those who do not realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in
helping Truth to prevail. -->

But we can see Germany's terrible catastrophe as a bitter stroke of luck.

<!-- the We may regard it as a great stroke of fortune for the German nation that its period of lingering suffering was so suddenly curtailed and transformed into such a .  -->

If things had gone on more slowly, but more surely, then Germany would have gone to ruin -- the disease would have become chronic.
- But since it took the form of an acute disaster, it showed itself clearly to many observers.

Man conquered the black plague more easily than he conquered tuberculosis. 
- The plague appeared in terrifying waves of death that shook the whole of mankind. It induces terror.
  - This is opposed by so much human energy.
- Tuberculosis advances insidiously. It induces gradual indifference. 
  - This is oppoosed by feeble means. 

Thus man has mastered the black plague, while tuberculosis still gets the better of him.

The same applies to diseases in nations. 

So long as these diseases are not of a catastrophic character, the population will slowly accustom itself to them and later succumb. 

<!-- It is then a stroke of luck--although a bitter one--when Fate decides to interfere in this slow process of decay and suddenly brings the victim face to face with the final stage of the disease. More often than not the result of a catastrophe is that a cure is at once undertaken and carried through with rigid determination.

But even in such a case the essential preliminary condition is always the recognition of the internal causes which have given rise to the disease in question. -->

The important question here is the differentiation of the root causes from the circumstances developing out of them.
- This becomes all the more difficult the longer the germs of disease remain in the national body

 <!-- and the longer they are allowed to become an integral part of that body. -->

<!-- It may easily happen that, as time goes on, it will become so difficult to recognize certain definite virulent poisons as such that they are accepted as belonging to the national being; or they are merely tolerated as a necessary evil, sothat drastic attempts to locate those alien germs are not held to be necessary. -->


<!-- During the long period of peace prior to the last war certain evils were apparent here and there although, with one or two exceptions, very little effort was made to discover their origin. Here again these exceptions were first and foremost those phenomena in the economic life of the nation which were more apparent to the individual than the evil conditions existing in a good many other spheres. -->
