One of the visible signs of decay in the old REICH was the slow setback which the general cultural level experienced. But by 'Kultur' I do not mean that which we nowadays style as civilization, which on the contrary may rather be regarded as
inimical to the spiritual elevation of life.

At the turn of the last century a new element began to make its appearance in our world. It was an element which had been hitherto absolutely unknown and foreign to us. 

In former times there had certainly been offences against good taste; but these were mostly departures from the orthodox canons of art, and posterity could recognize a certain historical value in them. But the new products showed signs, not only of artistic
aberration but of spiritual degeneration. Here, in the cultural sphere, the signs of the
coming collapse first became manifest.

The Bolshevization of art is the only cultural form of life and the only spiritual
manifestation of which Bolshevism is capable.

Anyone to whom this statement may appear strange need only take a glance at those lucky States which have become Bolshevized and, to his horror, he will there recognize those morbid monstrosities which have been produced by insane and degenerate
people. 

All those artistic aberrations which are classified under the names of cubism and dadism, since the opening of the present century, are manifestations of art which have come to be officially recognized by the State itself. This phenomenon made its
appearance even during the short-lived period of the Soviet Republic in Bavaria. At that
time one might easily have recognized how all the official posters, propagandist 
pictures and newspapers, etc., showed signs not only of political but also of cultural
decadence.

About sixty years ago a political collapse such as we are experiencing to-day would have been just as inconceivable as the cultural decline which has been manifested in cubist and futurist pictures ever since 1900. Sixty years ago an exhibition of so-called
dadistic 'experiences' would have been an absolutely preposterous idea. The organizers
of such an exhibition would then have been certified for the lunatic asylum, whereas,
to-day they are appointed presidents of art societies. At that time such an epidemic
would never have been allowed to spread. 

Public opinion would not have tolerated it, and the Government would not have remained silent; for it is the duty of a Government
to save its people from being stampeded into such intellectual madness. But intellectual
madness would have resulted from a development that followed the acceptance of this
kind of art. It would have marked one of the worst changes in human history; for it
would have meant that a retrogressive process had begun to take place in the human
brain, the final stages of which would be unthinkable.

If we study the course of our cultural life during the last twenty-five years we shall be
astonished to note how far we have already gone in this process of retrogression.
Everywhere we find the presence of those germs which give rise to protuberant
growths that must sooner or later bring about the ruin of our culture. Here we find
undoubted symptoms of slow corruption; and woe to the nations that are no longer able
to bring that morbid process to a halt.

In almost all the various fields of German art and culture those morbid phenomena may be observed. Here everything seems to have passed the culminating point of its excellence and to have entered the curve of a hasty decline. At the beginning of the
century the theatres seemed already degenerating and ceasing to be cultural factors,
except the Court theatres, which opposed this prostitution of the national art. With
these exceptions, and also a few other decent institutions, the plays produced on the
stage were of such a nature that the people would have benefited by not visiting them
at all. 

A sad symptom of decline was manifested by the fact that in the case of many 'art
centres' the sign was posted on the entrance doors: FOR ADULTS ONLY.

Let it be borne in mind that these precautions had to be taken in regard to institutions whose main purpose should have been to promote the education of the youth and not merely to provide amusement for sophisticated adults. What would the great
dramatists of other times have said of such measures and, above all, of the conditions
which made these measures necessary? How exasperated Schiller would have been,
and how Goethe would have turned away in disgust!

But what are Schiller, Goethe and Shakespeare when confronted with the heroes of our
modern German literature? Old and frowsy and outmoded and finished. For it was 
typical of this epoch that not only were its own products bad but that the authors of
such products and their backers reviled everything that had really been great in the
past. This is a phenomenon that is very characteristic of such epochs. The more vile and
miserable are the men and products of an epoch, the more they will hate and denigrate
the ideal achievements of former generations. What these people would like best would
be completely to destroy every vestige of the past, in order to do away with that sole
standard of comparison which prevents their own daubs from being looked upon as art.

Therefore the more lamentable and wretched are the products of each new era, the more it will try to obliterate all the memorials of the past. But any real innovation that is for the benefit of mankind can always face comparison with the best of what has gone
before; and frequently it happens that those monuments of the past guarantee the
acceptance of those modern productions. 

There is no fear that modern productions of
real worth will look pale and worthless beside the monuments of the past. What is
contributed to the general treasury of human culture often fulfils a part that is necessary
in order to keep the memory of old achievements alive, because this memory alone is
the standard whereby our own works are properly appreciated. Only those who have
nothing of value to give to the world will oppose everything that already exists and
would have it destroyed at all costs.

And this holds good not only for new phenomena in the cultural domain but also in
politics. The more inferior new revolutionary movements are, the more will they try to
denigrate the old forms. Here again the desire to pawn off their shoddy products as
great and original achievements leads them into a blind hatred against everything
which belongs to the past and which is superior to their own work. 

As long as the historical memory of Frederick the Great, for instance, still lives, Frederick Ebert can
arouse only a problematic admiration. The relation of the hero of Sans Souci to the
former republican of Bremen may be compared to that of the sun to the moon; for the
moon can shine only after the direct rays of the sun have left the earth. Thus we can
readily understand why it is that all the new moons in human history have hated the
fixed stars. In the field of politics, if Fate should happen temporarily to place the ruling
power in the hands of those nonentities they are not only eager to defile and revile the
past but at the same time they will use all means to evade criticism of their own acts.
The Law for the Protection of the Republic, which the new German State enacted, may
be taken as one example of this truth.

One has good grounds to be suspicious in regard to any new idea, or any doctrine or
philosophy, any political or economical movement, which tries to deny everything that
the past has produced or to present it as inferior and worthless. Any renovation which
is really beneficial to human progress will always have to begin its constructive work at
the level where the last stones of the structure have been laid. It need not blush to
utilize those truths which have already been established; for all human culture, as well
as man himself, is only the result of one long line of development, where each
generation has contributed but one stone to the building of the whole structure. The 
meaning and purpose of revolutions cannot be to tear down the whole building but to
take away what has not been well fitted into it or is unsuitable, and to rebuild the free
space thus caused, after which the main construction of the building will be carried on.
Thus alone will it be possible to talk of human progress; for otherwise the world would
never be free of chaos, since each generation would feel entitled to reject the past and to
destroy all the work of the past, as the necessary preliminary to any new work of its
own.

The saddest feature of the condition in which our whole civilization found itself before the War was the fact that it was not only barren of any creative force to produce its own works of art and civilization but that it hated, defiled and tried to efface the memory of
the superior works produced in the past. 

About the end of the last century people were
less interested in producing new significant works of their own--particularly in the
fields of dramatic art and literature--than in defaming the best works of the past and in
presenting them as inferior and antiquated. As if this period of disgraceful decadence
had the slightest capacity to produce anything of superior quality! The efforts made to
conceal the past from the eyes of the present afforded clear evidence of the fact that
these apostles of the future acted from an evil intent. These symptoms should have
made it clear to all that it was not a question of new, though wrong, cultural ideas but
of a process which was undermining the very foundations of civilization. It threw the
artistic feeling which had hitherto been quite sane into utter confusion, thus spiritually
preparing the way for political Bolshevism. If the creative spirit of the Periclean age be
manifested in the Parthenon, then the Bolshevist era is manifested through its cubist
grimace.

In this connection attention must be drawn once again to the want of courage displayed
by one section of our people, namely, by those who, in virtue of their education and
position, ought to have felt themselves obliged to take up a firm stand against this
outrage on our culture. But they refrained from offering serious resistance and
surrendered to what they considered the inevitable. This abdication of theirs was due,
however, to sheer funk lest the apostles of Bolshevist art might raise a rumpus; for those
apostles always violently attacked everyone who was not ready to recognize them as
the choice spirits of artistic creation, and they tried to strangle all opposition by saying
that it was the product of philistine and backwater minds. People trembled in fear lest
they might be accused by these yahoos and swindlers of lacking artistic appreciation, as
if it would have been a disgrace not to be able to understand and appreciate the
effusions of those mental degenerates or arrant rogues. Those cultural disciples,
however, had a very simple way of presenting their own effusions as works of the
highest quality. They offered incomprehensible and manifestly crazy productions to
their amazed contemporaries as what they called 'an inner experience'. Thus they
forestalled all adverse criticism at very little cost indeed. Of course nobody ever
doubted that there could have been inner experiences like that, but some doubt ought to 
have arisen as to whether or not there was any justification for exposing these
hallucinations of psychopaths or criminals to the sane portion of human society. The
works produced by a Moritz von Schwind or a Böcklin were also externalizations of an
inner experience, but these were the experiences of divinely gifted artists and not of
buffoons.

This situation afforded a good opportunity of studying the miserable cowardliness of
our so-called intellectuals who shirked the duty of offering serious resistance to the
poisoning of the sound instincts of our people. They left it to the people themselves to
formulate their own attitude towards his impudent nonsense. Lest they might be
considered as understanding nothing of art, they accepted every caricature of art, until
they finally lost the power of judging what is really good or bad.
Taken all in all, there were superabundant symptoms to show that a diseased epoch
had begun.
