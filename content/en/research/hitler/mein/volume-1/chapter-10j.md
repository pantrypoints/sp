The lack of orientation in German policy, both domestic and foreign, was obvious.

<!-- The best thing that could be said about the practice of making compromises is that it seemed outwardly to be in harmony with   -->

The necessary foundation was lacking, namely, a definite WELTANSCHAUUNG. 

These leaders also lacked that clear insight into the laws of political evolution which is a necessary quality in political leadership.

Bismarck's axiom is that 'politics is the art of the possible'. 
- This meant that in order to attain a definite political end, all possible means should be employed, or at least that all possibilities should be tried. 
- But his successors interpreted it as a solemn declaration that one is not necessarily bound to have political principles or political aims at all. 

<!-- But Bismarck was a slightly different man from the Chancellors who followed him. 

This difference allowed Bismarck to apply that formula to the very essence of his policy, while in the mouths of the others it took on an utterly different significance.

When he uttered that phrase Bismarck meant to say that  -->


<!-- The political leaders of the REICH at that time had no far-seeing policy.  -->


<!-- Many people who took a gloomy view of things at that time condemned the lack of ideas and lack of orientation which were evident in directing the policy of the REICH.

They recognized the inner weakness and futility of this policy. But such people played only a secondary role in politics. Those who had the Government of the country in their hands were quite as indifferent to principles of civil wisdom laid down by thinkers like
Houston Stewart Chamberlain as our political leaders now are.

These people are too stupid to think for themselves, and they have too much self-conceit to take from others
the instruction which they need. Oxenstierna (Note 14a) gave expression to a truth
which has lasted since time immemorial, when he said that the world is governed by
only a particle of wisdom. 

Almost every civil servant of councillor rank might naturally be supposed to possess only an atom or so belonging to this particle. But since Germany became a Republic even this modicum is wanting. And that is why they had to promulgate the Law for the Defence of the Republic, which prohibits the holding of such views or expressing them. 

It was fortunate for Oxenstierna that he lived at that time and not in this wise Republic of our time.

Already before the War that institution which should have represented the strength of the Reich--the Parliament, the Reichstag--was widely recognized as its weakest feature. 

Cowardliness and fear of shouldering responsibilities were associated together there in a perfect fashion. -->

One of the silliest notions today is that in Germany the parliament has ceased to function since the 1918 Revolution. 
- This implies that the case was different before the Revolution. 

But in reality the parliamentary institution never functioned except to the detriment of the country.
- It functioned thus in those days when people saw nothing or did not wish to see anything. 

**The German downfall is to be attributed in no small degree to this parliamentary institution.**

The Parliament should not be credited for preventing the catastrophe sooner. In reality, it was digging the grave of the German Nation and the German REICH during peace times.

The catastrophe was prevented by those who opposed the parliament.

<!-- From the immense mass of  that were due either directly or indirectly to the Parliament I shall select one the most intimately typical of this institution which was the most irresponsible of all time.  -->

Its most devastating evil was the appalling shilly-shally and weakness in conducting the REICH's internal and external affairs. 

<!-- It was attributable in the first place to the action of the Reichstag and was one of the principal causes of the political collapse. -->

Everything subject to the influence of Parliament was done by halves, no matter from what aspect you may regard it.

The REICH's foreign policy in the matter of alliances was an example of shillyshally. 

They wished to maintain peace, but in doing so they steered straight into war.

Their Polish policy was also carried out by half-measures. 

It resulted neither in a German triumph nor Polish conciliation. It made Russia an enemy.

They tried to solve the Alsace-Lorraine question through half-measures.

Instead of crushing the head of the French hydra once by granting Alsace-Lorraine equal rights with the other German States, they did neither.

They could not do anything because they had the greatest traitors to the country, such as Mr. Wetterlé of the Centre Party.
