## The Iron law of Nature

<!-- THERE ARE certain truths which stand out so openly on the roadsides of life, as it
were, that every passer-by may see them. Yet, because of their very obviousness, the
general run of people disregard such truths or at least they do not make them the object
of any conscious knowledge. People are so blind to some of the simplest facts in everyday life that they are highly surprised when somebody calls attention to what
everybody ought to know. Examples of The Columbus Egg lie around us in hundreds
of thousands; but observers like Columbus are rare. -->

<!-- Walking about in the garden of Nature, most men have the self-conceit to think that they know everything; yet almost all are blind to one of the outstanding principles that Nature employs in her work. This principle may be called the inner isolation which characterizes each and every living species on this earth. -->

<!-- Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that 

All the innumerable forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a fundamental law--one may call it an  -->

The iron law of Nature compels the various species to keep within the definite limits of their own life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind. 

Each animal mates only with one of its own species. 

<!-- The titmouse cohabits only with the titmouse, the finch with the finch, the stork with the stork, the field-mouse with the
field-mouse, the house-mouse with the house-mouse, the wolf with the she-wolf, etc. -->

Deviations from this law take place only in exceptional circumstances. 

This happens especially under the compulsion of captivity, or when some other obstacle makes procreative intercourse impossible between individuals of the same species. 

But then Nature abhors such intercourse with all her might.

<!-- ; and her protest is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the hybrid is either sterile or the fecundity of its descendants is limited. In most cases hybrids and their progeny are denied the ordinary powers of resistance to disease or the natural means of defence against outer attack. -->

Such a dispensation of Nature is quite logical. 

Every crossing between two breeds which are not quite equal results in a product which holds an intermediate place
between the levels of the two parents. 

This means that the offspring will be superior to the parent which stands in the biologically lower order of being, but not so  high as the higher parent. This is why it must eventually succumb in any struggle against the higher species. 

Such mating contradicts the will of Nature towards the selective improvements of life in general. 


<!-- The favourable preliminary to this improvement is not to mate individuals of higher and lower orders of being but rather to allow the complete triumph of the higher order.  -->

This means that the stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. 

Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel. He will feel so merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind.

If the iron law did not direct the process of evolution, then the higher development of organic life would not be conceivable at all.

This urge for the maintenance of the unmixed breed is a natural phenomenon.

It results in:
- the sharply defined outward distinction between one species and another
- the internal similarity of qualities peculiar to each species. 

The fox remains always a fox, the goose remains a goose..

<!-- , and the tiger will retain the character of a tiger.  -->

The only difference within the species is in the various degrees of structural strength and active power, in the intelligence, efficiency, endurance, etc., of the individual specimens.

<!-- It would be impossible to find a fox which has a kindly and protective disposition towards geese, just as no cat exists which has a friendly disposition towards mice. -->

That is why the struggle between the various species arises from hunger and love, not from mutual antipathy. 

In both cases, Nature looks on calmly and is even pleased with what happens.

The struggle for the daily livelihood leaves behind the weak, diseased, or wavering.

The fight of the male to possess the female gives to the strongest the right, or the possibility to propagate its kind. 

This struggle furthers the health and resistance powers of the species.

Thus it is one of the causes underlying the process of development towards a higher quality of being.

If things were opposite, then retrogression might set in. 

The inferior always outnumber the superior. 

The inferior would always increase more rapidly if they possessed the same capacities for survival and for the procreation of their kind.

This would force the best in quality to recede into the background. 

Therefore, a corrective measure in favour of the better quality must intervene.

Nature supplies this by establishing rigorous conditions of life which the weaker will have to submit to. This will numerically restrict them.

The surviving portion then cannot indiscriminately multiply, for here a new and rigorous selection takes place, according to strength and health. 

Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the stronger. She wishes even less that a superior race intermingles with an inferior one.

This is because this would render all her efforts, throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being, futile.

History furnishes us with innumerable instances that prove this law. 

Whenever Aryans have mingled their blood with that of an inferior race, the result has been the downfall of the people of a higher culture.

In North America, the population is prevalently Teutonic. Those elements intermingled with the inferior race only very little.

This leads to a quality of mankind and a civilization different from those of Central and South America. 

In these latter countries, the Latin immigrants mated with the aborigines to a very large extent.

But in North America, the Teutonic element has kept its racial stock pure. 

This allowed it to dominate the American Continent and will remain master of it as long as that element does not adulterate its blood.

In short, the results of miscegenation are always the following:

1. The level of the superior race becomes lowered
2. Physical and mental degeneration sets in, thus leading slowly but steadily towards a progressive drying up of the vital sap.

The act which brings about such a development is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator. As a sin, this act will be avenged. 

Contradicting the iron logic of Nature conflicts with human xistence. 

By acting against the laws of Nature, man prepares the way that leads to his ruin.

<!-- Here we meet the insolent objection, which is Jewish in its inspiration and is typical of
the modern pacifist.  -->

The Jew-inspired pacifist will object: "Man can control even Nature."

<!-- There are millions who repeat by rote that piece of Jewish babble and end up by
imagining that somehow they themselves are the conquerors of Nature.  -->

Yet their only weapon is just a mere preposterous idea. If one accepted it, then it would be impossible even for the  world to exist. 

Man has failed to overcome Nature in any sphere. He has merely succeeded in lifting a tiny corner of the enormous veil of her eternal mysteries and secret.

Man never creates anything. All he can do is to discover something. 

He does not master Nature but has only come to be the master of those living beings who have not gained the knowledge he has arrived at by penetrating into some of Nature's laws and mysteries. 


An idea can never subject to its own sway those conditions which are necessary for mankind's existence and development.
- This is becuase the idea itself has come only from man. 
- Without man there would be no human idea in this world.

The idea is therefore dependent on man's existence.
- Consequently, it is dependent on those laws which furnish the conditions of his existence.

Certain ideas are even confined to certain people. 

This holds true with regard to those ideas which are based on feelings and not in objective scientific truth.
- In other words: **THEY REFLECT AN INNER EXPERIENCE.**

All such ideas, which have nothing to do with cold logic as such but represent mere manifestations of feeling, such as ethical and moral conceptions, etc., are inextricably bound up with man's existence. 

It is to the creative powers of man's imagination that such ideas owe their existence.


### War then Pacifism

A necessary condition for the maintenance of such ideas is the existence of certain races and certain types of men. 

For example, anyone who wants the pacifist idea to prevail in this world should do all he can to help the Germans conquer the world.

If the reverse should happen, then the last pacifist would disappear with the last German.

Only the German people fell a prey to this idea. 

Whether you like it or not, you would have to make up your mind to forget wars if you would achieve the pacifist ideal.

Nothing less than this was the plan of the American world-redeemer, Woodrow Wilson. 

Anyhow that was what our visionaries believed, and they thought that through his plans their ideals would be attained.

The pacifist-humanitarian idea may become an excellent one after the most superior type of manhood succeeds in subjugating the world.

 <!-- to such an extent that this type is then sole master of the earth.  -->

This idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure according to which its application would become difficult
and finally impossible. 

So fight first, then pacifism. 

If pacifism came first then it means that mankind has already passed the zenith of its development. Then the end be the  degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos, not be the supremacy of some moral ideal.

People may laugh at this statement.

But our planet has been moving through the spaces of ether for millions and millions of years, uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily begin to do so again--if men should forget that wherever they have reached a superior level of existence, it was not the result of following the ideas of crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron laws of Nature.
