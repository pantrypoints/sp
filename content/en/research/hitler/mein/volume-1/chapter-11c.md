War offers an excellent occasion for observing this phenomenon.

In times of distress, harmless boys suddenly spring up and become heroes.

<!-- , full of determination,
undaunted in the presence of Death and manifesting wonderful powers of calm
reflection under such circumstances.  -->

<!-- If such an hour of trial did not come nobody would have thought that the soul of a hero lurked in the body of that beardless youth. -->

A special impulse is almost always necessary to bring a man of genius into the foreground. The sledge-hammer of Fate which strikes down the one so easily suddenly finds the counter-impact of steel when it strikes at the other. 

And, after the common shell of everyday life is broken, the core that lay hidden in it is displayed to the eyes of an astonished world. 

This surrounding world then grows obstinate and will not believe that what had seemed so like itself is really of that different quality so suddenly displayed. This is a process which is repeated probably every time a man of outstanding significance appears.

Though an inventor, for example, does not establish his fame until the very day that he carries through his invention, it would be a mistake to believe that the creative genius did not become alive in him until that moment. From the very hour of his birth the spark of genius is living within the man who has been endowed with the real creative faculty. 

True genius is an innate quality. It can never be the result of education or training.

This holds good not merely of the individual but also of the race. Those peoples who manifest creative abilities in certain periods of their history have always been fundamentally creative. 

It belongs to their very nature, even though this fact may escape the eyes of the superficial observer. Here also recognition from outside is only the consequence of practical achievement. 

Since the rest of the world is incapable of recognizing genius as such, it can only see the visible manifestations of
genius in the form of inventions, discoveries, buildings, painting, etc.; but even here a
long time passes before recognition is given. 

Just as the individual person who has been endowed with the gift of genius, or at least talent of a very high order, cannot bring that endowment to realization until he comes under the urge of special circumstances, so in the life of the nations the creative capacities and powers frequently have to wait until certain conditions stimulate them to action.

The Aryan race has been, and still is, the standard-bearer of human progress.

<!-- . As soon as Fate brings them face to face with special circumstances their powers begin to develop progressively and to be manifested in tangible form. 

The characteristic cultures which they create under such circumstances are almost always conditioned by the soil, the
climate and the people they subjugate.  -->

The last factor is the character of the people. This is the most decisive one. 

The more primitive the technical conditions under which the civilizing activity takes place, the more necessary is the existence of manual labour which can be organized and employed so as to take the place of mechanical power. 

<!-- Had it not been possible for them to employ members of the inferior race which they conquered, the Aryans would never have been in a position to take the first steps on the road which led them to a later type of culture; just as, without the help of certain suitable animals which they were able to tame, they would never have come to the invention of mechanical power which has subsequently enabled them to do without these beasts. The phrase, 'The Moor has accomplished his function, so let him now depart', has, unfortunately, a profound application. 

For thousands of years the horse has been the faithful servant of man. But now motor power has dispensed with the use of the horse. -->

<!-- In a few years to come the use of the horse will cease entirely; and yet without its collaboration man could scarcely have come to the stage of development which he has now created. -->

The inferior races were essential in establishing superior types of civilization.

They alone could supply the lack of mechanical means for progress. 

The first stages of human civilization were based on the slavery of the inferior races, not so much on the use of tame animals.

 <!-- as on the employment of human beings who were members of an inferior race. -->

Only after subjugated races were employed as slaves was a similar fate allotted to animals, and not vice versa, as some people would have us believe. 

<!-- At first it was the conquered enemy who had to draw the plough and only afterwards did the ox and horse take his place.  -->

Only pacifists think of this as a sign of human degradation. 

They fail to recognize that this evolution had to happen so that man could reach that degree of civilization which these apostles now
exploit to make the world pay attention to their rigmarole.

The progress of mankind is like the process of ascending an infinite ladder. 

One does not reach the higher level without first having climbed the lower rungs. 

<!-- The Aryan therefore had to take that road which his sense of reality pointed out to him and not that which the modern pacifist dreams of. 

The path of reality is, however, difficult and hard to tread; yet it is the only one which finally leads to the goal
where the others envisage mankind in their dreams. But the real truth is that those
dreamers help only to lead man away from his goal rather than towards it. -->

<!-- It was not by mere chance that the first forms of civilization arose there where  -->

The superiority of the Aryans was proven by them subjugating the inferior races and enslaving them. It was not mere chance. 

<!-- forci them to obey his command.  -->

The members of the inferior race became the first mechanical tools in the service of a growing civilization.

Thereby the way was clearly indicated which the Aryan had to follow. As a conqueror, he subjugated inferior races and turned their physical powers into organized channels under his own leadership, forcing them to follow his will and purpose. 

By making them as slaves, they made their lives easier had they stayed in 'freedom'.

 <!-- imposing on them a useful, though hard, manner of employing their powers he not only spared the lives of those whom he had conquered but probably   -->

The Aryan ruthlessly maintained his position as their master and as the advancer of civilization. 

This depended exclusively on his inborn abilities. 

However, as soon as his subject began to rise and approach the level of their conqueror through the use of his language, the master-servant barrier broke down. 

The Aryan neglected to maintain his own racial stock unmixed and therewith lost the right to live in the paradise which he himself had created. 

He became submerged in the racial mixture and gradually lost his cultural creativeness, until he finally grew mentally and  physically more like the aborigines whom he had subjected.

<!-- For some time he could continue to live on the capital of that culture which still remained; but a condition
of fossilization soon set in and he sank into oblivion. -->

That is how cultures and empires decline and yield their places to new formations.

The adulteration of the blood and racial deterioration conditioned thereby are the only causes that account for the decline of ancient civilizations.

War never ruins nations. Ruin happens through the loss of their powers of resistance, which are exclusively a characteristic of pure racial blood. 

In this world everything that is not of sound racial stock is like chaff.
