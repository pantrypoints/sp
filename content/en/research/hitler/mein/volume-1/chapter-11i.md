The Marxist Doctrine provoked the opposition of decent people. They refused to admit these demands which seemed fundamentally unjust and impossible to realize.

<!--  which, because of
the form and pseudo-philosophical trimmings in which they are presented,  -->

Under the cloak of purely social concepts there are hidden aims which are of a Satanic character. 

<!-- These aims are even expounded in the open with the clarity of unlimited impudence.  -->

This Marxist doctrine is an individual mixture of human reason and human absurdity.

<!--  but the
combination is arranged in such a way that only the absurd part of it could ever be put
into practice, but never the reasonable part of it. By  -->

It categorically repudiates the personal worth of the individual and also the nation and its racial constituent.

It destroys the fundamental basis of all civilization.

<!-- ; for civilization essentially
depends on these very factors. Such is the true essence of the Marxist
WELTANSCHAUUNG, so far as the word WELTANSCHAUUNG can be applied at all
to this phantom arising from a criminal brain.  -->

The destruction of the concept of personality and race removes the chief obstacle which barred the way to domination of the inferior Jews.

 <!-- social body by its inferior elements, which are the . -->

The very absurdity of the economic and political theories of Marxism gives the doctrine
its peculiar significance. Because of its pseudo-logic, intelligent people refuse to support
it, while all those who are less accustomed to use their intellectual faculties, or who
have only a rudimentary notion of economic principles, join the Marxist cause with
flying banners. 

The intelligence behind the movement--for even this movement needs
intelligence if it is to subsist--is supplied by the Jews themselves, naturally of course as a
gratuitous service which is at the same time a sacrifice on their part.

Thus arose a movement which was composed exclusively of manual workers under the
leadership of Jews. To all external appearances, this movement strives to ameliorate the 
conditions under which the workers live; but in reality its aim is to enslave and thereby
annihilate the non-Jewish races.

The propaganda which the freemasons had carried on among the so-called intelligentsia, whereby their pacifist teaching paralysed the instinct for national selfpreservation, was now extended to the broad masses of the workers and bourgeoisie by means of the Press, which was almost everywhere in Jewish hands. 

To those two instruments of disintegration a third and still more ruthless one was added, namely, the
organization of brute physical force among the masses. As massed columns of attacks,
the Marxist troops stormed those parts of the social order which had been left standing
after the two former undermining operations had done their work.

<!-- The combined activity of all these forces has been marvellously managed. And it will
not be surprising if it turns out that those institutions which have always appeared as
the organs of the more or less traditional authority of the State should now fall before
the Marxist attack. Among our higher and highest State officials, with very few
exceptions, the Jew has found the cost complacent backers in his work of destruction.
An attitude of sneaking servility towards 'superiors' and supercilious arrogance
towards 'inferiors' are the characteristics of this class of people, as well as a grade of
stupidity which is really frightening and at the same time a towering self-conceit, which
has been so consistently developed to make it amusing. -->

But these qualities are of the greatest utility to the Jew in his dealings with our authorities. Therefore they are qualities which he appreciates most in the officials. If I were to sketch roughly the actual struggle which is now beginning I should describe it somewhat thus:


The Jew is not satisfied with the economic conquest of the world. He also demands that it must come under his political control. 

So he subdivides the organized Marxist power into 2 parts:

1. The political movement 
2. The trades union movement

<!-- , which correspond to the ultimate objectives that are to be fought for in this struggle which is carried on under the direction of the Jew.  -->

<!-- To outward appearance, these seem to be two independent movements, but in reality they constitute an indivisible unity. The two divisions are: . -->

The trades union movement gathers in the recruits. It offers assistance and protection to the workers in their hard struggle for existence caused by the greed and narrow-mindedness of industrialists.

<!-- Unless the workers be ready to surrender all claims to an existence which the dignity of human nature itself demands, and unless they are ready to submit their fate to the will of employers who in many
cases have no sense of human responsibilities and are utterly callous to human wants, 
then the worker must necessarily take matters into his own hands, seeing that the
organized social community--that is to say, the State--pays no attention to his needs. -->

The so-called national-minded bourgeoisie, blinded by its own material interests, opposes this life-or-death struggle of the workers. They place the most difficult obstacles in their way. 

<!-- Not only does this bourgeoisie hinder all efforts to enact legislation which would -->

They refuse to:
- shorten the inhumanly long hours of work
- prohibit child-labour
- grant security and protection to women
- improve the hygienic conditions of the workshops and the dwellings of the working-class

The shrewd Jew then takes the cause of the oppressed into his own hands. 

He gradually becomes the leader of the trades union movements.

<!-- , which is an easy task for him, because he does not genuinely intend to find remedies for the social wrong:  -->

His only one objective is to gather and consolidate a body of followers who will act under his commands as a weapon in the economic war to destroy national economic independence. 

<!-- For, while a sound social policy has to move between the two poles of securing a decent level of public health and welfare on the one hand and, on
the other, that of safeguarding , the
Jew does not take these poles into account at all.  -->


The Jew aims to destroy both:
- public welfare
- the independence of the economic life of the nation

<!-- He would ruin, rather than safeguard, the independence of the national economic system. Therefore, as the leader of the trades union movement, he has no scruples about putting forward demands which not only go beyond the declared purpose of the movement but could not be carried into effect without ruining the
national economic structure. 

He has no interest in seeing a healthy and sturdy population develop.

 he would be more content to see the people degenerate
into an unthinking herd which could be reduced to total subjection. Because these are his final objectives, he can afford to put forward the most absurd claims. He knows very well that these claims can never be realized and that therefore nothing in the actual state of affairs could be altered by them, but that the most they can do is to arouse the spirit of unrest among the masses. That is exactly the purpose which he wishes such propaganda to serve and not a real and honest improvement of the social conditions.  -->

<!-- The Jews will therefore remain the unquestioned leaders of the trades union movement so long as a campaign is not undertaken, which must be carried out on gigantic lines, for the enlightenment of the masses; so that they will be enabled better to understand the causes of their misery. Or the same end might be achieved if the government authorities would get rid of the Jew and his work. For as long as the masses remain so ill-informed as they actually are to-day, and as long as the State remains as indifferent to their lot as it now is, the masses will follow whatever leader makes them the most extravagant promises in regard to economic matters. The Jew is a past master at this art and his activities are not hampered by moral considerations of any kind.

Naturally it takes him only a short time to defeat all his competitors in this field and drive them from the scene of action. In accordance with the general brutality and  rapacity of his nature,  -->

He then turns the trades union movement into an organization for the exercise of physical violence. 

<!-- The resistance of those whose common sense has hitherto saved them from surrendering to the Jewish dictatorship is now broken down by terrorization. The success of that kind of activity is enormous. -->

<!-- Parallel with this, the political organization advances. It operates hand-in-hand with the trades union movement, inasmuch as the latter prepares the masses for the political organization and even forces them into it. This is also the source that provides the money which the political organization needs to keep its enormous apparatus in action. -->

The trades union organization then becomes the organ of control for the political activity of its members and whips in the masses for all great political demonstrations. 

In the end, it ceases to struggle for economic interests. Its chief weapon is the general strike -- the refusal to continue work.

<!-- --which takes the form of a general strike--at the disposal of the political movement. -->

It uses a Press, whose contents are adapted for the most ignorant readers, as its instrument which prepares the lowest stratum of the nation for a campaign of ruthless destruction.

<!-- It is not considered part of the purpose of this Press to inspire its readers with ideals which might help them to lift their minds above the sordid conditions of their daily lives; but, on the contrary, it panders to their lowest instincts. Among the lazy-minded and self-seeking sections of the masses this kind of speculation turns out lucrative.

It is this Press above all which carries on a fanatical campaign of calumny, strives to tear down everything that might be considered as a mainstay of national independence and to sabotage all cultural values as well as to destroy the autonomy of the national economic system.

It aims its attack especially against all men of character who refuse to fall into line with the Jewish efforts to obtain control over the State or who appear dangerous to the Jews merely because of their superior intelligence. 

For in order to incur the enmity of the Jew it is not necessary to show any open hostility towards him. It is quite sufficient if one be considered capable of opposing the Jew some time in the future or using his abilities and character to enhance the power and position of a nation which the Jew finds hostile to himself.

The Jewish instinct never fails where these problems have to be dealt with. It readily discerns the true mentality of those whom the Jew meets in everyday life. 

Those who are not of a kindred spirit with him may be sure of being listed among his enemies.  -->

The Jew is not the object of aggression but the aggressor himself. He considers as his enemies not only those who attack him but also those who may be capable of resisting him. 

The means which he employs to break people of this kind, who may show themselves decent and upright, are not the open means generally used in honourable conflict, but falsehood and calumny.

He will stop at nothing. His utterly low-down conduct is so appalling that one really cannot be surprised if in the imagination of our people the Jew is pictured as the incarnation of Satan and the symbol of evil.

<!-- The ignorance of the broad masses as regards the inner character of the Jew, and the lack of instinct and insight that our upper classes display, are some of the reasons which explain how it is that so many people fall an easy prey to the systematic campaign of falsehood which the Jew carries on. -->

The upper classes, with their innate cowardliness, turn away from anyone whom the Jew attacks with lies and calumny.

The common people, on the other hand, believe everything.

 <!-- whether because of their ignorance or their simple-mindedness. -->

Government authorities wrap themselves up in a robe of silence, but more frequently they persecute the victims of Jewish attacks in order to stop the campaign in the Jewish Press. 

To the fatuous mind of the government official such a line of conduct appears to belong to the policy of upholding the authority of the State and preserving public order.

Gradually the Marxist weapon in the hands of the Jew becomes a constant bogy to decent people. Sometimes the fear of it sticks in the brain or weighs upon them as a kind of nightmare. People begin to quail before this fearful foe and therewith become his victims.
