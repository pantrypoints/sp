<!-- The German National Socialist Labour Party -->

<!-- HERE AT the close of the volume I shall describe the first stage in the progress of our
movement and shall give a brief account of the problems we had to deal with during
that period. In doing this I have no intention of expounding the ideals which we have
set up as the goal of our movement; for these ideals are so momentous in their
significance that an exposition of them will need a whole volume. Therefore I shall
devote the second volume of this book to a detailed survey of the principles which form
the programme of our movement and I shall attempt to draw a picture of what we
mean by the word 'State'. When I say 'we' in this connection I mean to include all those
hundreds of thousands who have fundamentally the same longing, though in the
individual cases they cannot find adequate words to describe the vision that hovers
before their eyes. It is a characteristic feature of  -->

All great reforms in the beginning only has one protagonist to come forward on behalf of several millions of people.

<!-- The final goal of a great reformation has often been the object of profound
longing on the parts of hundreds of thousands for many centuries before, until finally
one among them comes forward as a herald to announce the will of that multitude and
become the standard-bearer of the old yearning, which he now leads to a realization in
a new idea. -->

Millions of our people yearn for a radical change.

<!-- Others show it in resentment and anger and indignation. Among some the profound discontent calls forth an attitude of indifference, while it urges others to violent manifestations of wrath. Another indication of this feeling may be seen on the one hand in the attitude of those  -->

Some people show this yearning by:
- abstaining from voting at elections, or
- join the left wing as fanatical extremists.

Our young movement had to appeal first of all to those left wing extremists.

<!-- It was not meant to be an organization for contented and satisfied people, but was meant to gather in all those who were suffering from profound anxiety and could find no peace, those who were unhappy and discontented. It was not meant to float on the surface of the nation
but rather to push its roots deep among the masses. -->

In 1918, Germany had been torn into two parts:

1. The smaller part contained the intellectual classes

They appeared to be national-minded and wanted to defend the interests of the State which really was the dynastic regime.

<!--  but that word meant nothing else to them except a very vague and
feeble concept of the duty to , which in
turn seemed identical with those of the .  -->

This class tried to defend its ideas and reach its aims by carrying on the fight with the aid of intellectual weapons. These had  only a superficial effect against the brutal measures employed by the adversaries.

<!-- , in the face of which the intellectual
weapons were of their very nature bound to fail.  -->

<!-- With one violent blow the class which had hitherto governed was now struck down. It trembled with fear and accepted every
humiliation imposed on it by the merciless victor. -->

2. The broad masses of manual labourers

These had a radically Marxist tendency. They were determined to break any kind of intellectual resistance by the use of brute force. 

They had no nationalist tendencies whatsoever. 

On the contrary, they promoted the interests of the foreign oppressor. 


In 1918, it was clear that Germany would have no resurgence until we had restored our national strength to face the outside world. 

For this purpose, weapons are not the preliminary necessity, though our bourgeois 'statesmen' always blathered about it being so. 

**What was lacking was was will-power.** 

At one time the Germans had more than enough military armament. But they lacked:
- the energy* to for national self-preservation and 
- the will to hold on to one's own. 

{{< n n="The Germans were materially depleted compared to their enemies. This caused the loss of energy. This wrong belief became evident again in World War 2." >}}


The best armament is only dead and worthless material as long as the spirit is wanting which makes men willing and determined to avail themselves of such weapons. 

Germany was rendered defenceless not because she lacked arms, but because she lacked the will to keep her arms to maintain her people.

Today, Left-wing politicians insist that their obsequious foreign policy necessarily results from the disarmament of Germany.

But the truth is that they are traitors. 

<!-- To all that kind of talk the answer ought to be: No, the contrary is the truth.  -->

Their giving up the arms was dictated by their anti-national policy. 
<!-- and criminal policy of abandoning the interests of the nation.  -->

<!-- And now you try to make people believe that your miserable whining is fundamentally due to the fact that you have no arms. Just like everything else in your onduct, this is a lie and a falsification of the true reason. -->

But the politicians of the Right deserve exactly the same reproach. 

Their miserable cowardice let the ruffians of Jews, who came into power in 1918, steal Germany's weapons. 

The conservative politicians cannot use the disarmament as the excuse for their policy of prudence (that is to say, cowardice).

<!-- Here, again, the contrary is the
truth.  -->

In reality, the disarmament is the result of their lack of spirit.

**Therefore the problem of restoring Germany's power is not a question of how can we manufacture arms but rather how we can produce that spirit which enables a people to bear arms.** 

Once this spirit prevails among a people then it will find a thousand ways, each of which leads to the necessary armament. 

<!-- But a coward will not fire even a single shot when attacked though he may be armed with ten pistols. For him they are of less value than a blackthorn in the hands of a man of courage. -->

The problem of re-establishing Germany's political power is first of all a problem of restoring the instinct of national self-preservation.

Every preparatory step in foreign policy and every foreign judgment on the worth of a State is not grounded on the weapons that they have. It is based on the moral capacity for resistance that the State is believed to have. 

The question whether or not a nation be desirable as an ally is not so much determined by the inert mass of arms which it has at hand but by the obvious presence of a sturdy will to national self-preservation and a heroic courage which will fight through to the last breath. For an alliance is not made between arms but between men.

Britain will therefore be the most valuable ally in the world as long as it:
- can be counted on to show that brutality and tenacity in its government
- has the spirit of the broad masses, which enables it to carry through any struggle

 <!-- that it once enters upon, no matter how long such a struggle may last, or however great the sacrifice that may be necessary or whatever the means that have to be employed;  -->

All this even though the actual military equipment at hand may be utterly inadequate when compared with that of other nations.
