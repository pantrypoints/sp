 <!-- was not the EX CATHEDRA style of the Marxist writers, but  -->

The formidable propagandist work done by tens of thousands of agitators won over millions of workpeople to the Marxist cause.

It began with the fiery agitator and ended in the smallest orator in the syndicate.

 <!-- the trusted delegate and the platform orator.  -->

There were:
- the hundreds of thousands of meetings where these orators, standing on tables in smoky taverns, hammered their ideas into the heads of the masses
- the gigantic mass-demonstrations

This let them acquire an admirable psychological knowledge of the human material they had to deal with. 

<!-- And in this way they were enabled to select the best weapons for
their assault on the citadel of public opinion. In addition to all this there were  -->

<!--  with processions in which a hundred thousand men took
part. 

All this was calculated to impress on the petty-hearted individual the proud conviction that, though a small worm, he was at the same time a cell of the great dragon before whose devastating breath the hated bourgeois world would one day be consumed in fire and flame, and the dictatorship of the proletariat would celebrate its
conclusive victory. -->

This kind of propaganda influenced men in such a way as to give them a taste for reading the Social Democratic Press and prepare their minds for its teaching. 

That Press, in its turn, was a vehicle of the spoken word rather than of the written word. Whereas in the bourgeois camp professors and learned writers, theorists and authors of all kinds,
made attempts at talking, in the Marxist camp real speakers often made attempts at
writing. And it was precisely the Jew who was most prominent here. In general and
because of his shrewd dialectical skill and his knack of twisting the truth to suit his own
purposes, he was an effective writer but in reality his MÉTIER was that of a
revolutionary orator rather than a writer.

For this reason the journalistic bourgeois world, setting aside the fact that here also the
Jew held the whip hand and that therefore this press did not really interest itself in the
instructtion of the broad masses, was not able to exercise even the least influence over
the opinions held by the great masses of our people.

It is difficult to remove emotional prejudices, psychological bias, feelings, etc., and to
put others in their place. Success depends here on imponderable conditions and
influences. Only the orator who is gifted with the most sensitive insight can estimate all
this. Even the time of day at which the speech is delivered has a decisive influence on its
results. The same speech, made by the same orator and on the same theme, will have 
very different results according as it is delivered at ten o'clock in the forenoon, at three
in the afternoon, or in the evening.

When I first engaged in public speaking I arranged
for meetings to take place in the forenoon and I remember particularly a demonstration
that we held in the Munich Kindl Keller 'Against the Oppression of German Districts.'
That was the biggest hall then in Munich and the audacity of our undertaking was
great. In order to make the hour of the meeting attractive for all the members of our
movement and the other people who might come, I fixed it for ten o'clock on a Sunday
morning. The result was depressing. But it was very instructive. The hall was filled. The
impression was profound, but the general feeling was cold as ice. Nobody got warmed
up, and I myself, as the speaker of the occasion, felt profoundly unhappy at the thought
that I could not establish the slightest contact with my audience. I do not think I spoke
worse than before, but the effect seemed absolutely negative. I left the hall very
discontented, but also feeling that I had gained a new experience. Later on I tried the
same kind of experiment, but always with the same results.

That was nothing to be wondered at. If one goes to a theatre to see a matinée
performance and then attends an evening performance of the same play one is
astounded at the difference in the impressions created. A sensitive person recognizes
for himself the fact that these two states of mind caused by the matinee and the evening
performance respectively are quite different in themselves. The same is true of cinema
productions. This latter point is important; for one may say of the theatre that perhaps
in the afternoon the actor does not make the same effort as in the evening. But surely it
cannot be said that the cinema is different in the afternoon from what it is at nine
o'clock in the evening. No, here the time exercises a distinct influence, just as a room
exercises a distinct influence on a person. There are rooms which leave one cold, for
reasons which are difficult to explain. There are rooms which refuse steadfastly to allow
any favourable atmosphere to be created in them. Moreover, certain memories and
traditions which are present as pictures in the human mind may have a determining
influence on the impression produced. 

Thus, a representation of Parsifal at Bayreuth
will have an effect quite different from that which the same opera produces in any other
part of the world. The mysterious charm of the House on the 'Festival Heights' in the
old city of The Margrave cannot be equalled or substituted anywhere else.
In all these cases one deals with the problem of influencing the freedom of the human
will. And that is true especially of meetings where there are men whose wills are
opposed to the speaker and who must be brought around to a new way of thinking. In
the morning and during the day it seems that the power of the human will rebels with
its strongest energy against any attempt to impose upon it the will or opinion of
another. On the other hand, in the evening it easily succumbs to the domination of a
stronger will. Because really in such assemblies there is a contest between two opposite
forces. The superior oratorical art of a man who has the compelling character of an
apostle will succeed better in bringing around to a new way of thinking those who have 
naturally been subjected to a weakening of their forces of resistance rather than in
converting those who are in full possession of their volitional and intellectual energies.
The mysterious artificial dimness of the Catholic churches also serves this purpose, the
burning candles, the incense, the thurible, etc.

In this struggle between the orator and the opponent whom he must convert to his
cause this marvellous sensibility towards the psychological influences of propaganda
can hardly ever be availed of by an author. Generally speaking, the effect of the writer's
work helps rather to conserve, reinforce and deepen the foundations of a mentality
already existing. All really great historical revolutions were not produced by the written
word. At most, they were accompanied by it.

It is out of the question to think that the French Revolution could have been carried into
effect by philosophizing theories if they had not found an army of agitators led by
demagogues of the grand style. These demagogues inflamed popular passion that had
been already aroused, until that volcanic eruption finally broke out and convulsed the
whole of Europe. And the same happened in the case of the gigantic Bolshevik
revolution which recently took place in Russia. It was not due to the writers on Lenin's
side but to the oratorical activities of those who preached the doctrine of hatred and
that of the innumerable small and great orators who took part in the agitation.
The masses of illiterate Russians were not fired to Communist revolutionary
enthusiasm by reading the theories of Karl Marx but by the promises of paradise made
to the people by thousands of agitators in the service of an idea.
It was always so, and it will always be so.
