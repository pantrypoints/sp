Our pig-headed intellectuals live apart from the practical world. They think that a writer is necessarily superior to an orator in intelligence.

This point of view was once exquisitely illustrated by a critique, published in a certain
National paper which I have already mentioned, where it was stated that one is often
disillusioned by reading the speech of an acknowledged great orator in print. 

That reminded me of another article which came into my hands during the War. It dealt with the speeches of Lloyd George, who was then Minister of Munitions, and examined them in a painstaking way under the microscope of criticism. The writer made the brilliant
statement that these speeches showed inferior intelligence and learning and that,
moreover, they were banal and commonplace productions. I myself procured some of
these speeches, published in pamphlet form, and had to laugh at the fact that a normal
German quill-driver did not in the least understand these psychological masterpieces in
the art of influencing the masses. This man criticized these speeches exclusively
according to the impression they made on his own blasé mind, whereas the great British
Demagogue had produced an immense effect on his audience through them, and in the 
widest sense on the whole of the British populace. Looked at from this point of view,
that Englishman's speeches were most wonderful achievements, precisely because they
showed an astounding knowledge of the soul of the broad masses of the people. For
that reason their effect was really penetrating. Compare with them the futile
stammerings of a Bethmann-Hollweg. 

On the surface his speeches were undoubtedly more intellectual, but they just proved this man's inability to speak to the people, which
he really could not do. Nevertheless, to the average stupid brain of the German writer,
who is, of course, endowed with a lot of scientific learning, it came quite natural to
judge the speeches of the English Minister--which were made for the purpose of
influencing the masses--by the impression which they made on his own mind, fossilized
in its abstract learning. And it was more natural for him to compare them in the light of
that impression with the brilliant but futile talk of the German statesman, which of
course appealed to the writer's mind much more favourably. That the genius of Lloyd
George was not only equal but a thousandfold superior to that of a Bethmann-Hollweg
is proved by the fact that he found for his speeches that form and expression which
opened the hearts of his people to him and made these people carry out his will
absolutely. The primitive quality itself of those speeches, the originality of his
expressions, his choice of clear and simple illustration, are examples which prove the
superior political capacity of this Englishman. For one must never judge the speech of a
statesman to his people by the impression which it leaves on the mind of a university
professor but by the effect it produces on the people. And this is the sole criterion of the
orator's genius.

The astonishing development of our movement, which was created from nothing a few
years ago and is to-day singled out for persecution by all the internal and external
enemies of our nation, must be attributed to the constant recognition and practical
application of those principles.

Written matter also played an important part in our movement; but at the stage of
which I am writing it served to give an equal and uniform education to the directors of
the movement, in the upper as well as in the lower grades, rather than to convert the
masses of our adversaries. It was only in very rare cases that a convinced and devoted
Social Democrat or Communist was induced to acquire an understanding of our
WELTANSCHAUUNG or to study a criticism of his own by procuring and reading one
of our pamphlets or even one of our books. Even a newspaper is rarely read if it does
not bear the stamp of a party affiliation. Moreover, the reading of newspapers helps
little; because the general picture given by a single number of a newspaper is so
confused and produces such a fragmentary impression that it really does not influence
the occasional reader. And where a man has to count his pennies it cannot be assumed
that, exclusively for the purpose of being objectively informed, he will become a regular
reader or subscriber to a paper which opposes his views. Only one who has already
joined a movement will regularly read the party organ of that movement, and especially
for the purpose of keeping himself informed of what is happening in the movement. 
It is quite different with the 'spoken' leaflet. Especially if it be distributed gratis it will be
taken up by one person or another, all the more willingly if its display title refers to a
question about which everybody is talking at the moment. Perhaps the reader, after
having read through such a leaflet more or less thoughtfully, will have new viewpoints
and mental attitudes and may give his attention to a new movement. But with these,
even in the best of cases, only a small impulse will be given, but no definite conviction
will be created; because the leaflet can do nothing more than draw attention to
something and can become effective only by bringing the reader subsequently into a
situation where he is more fundamentally informed and instructed. Such instruction
must always be given at the mass assembly.

Mass assemblies are also necessary for the reason that, in attending them, the individual
who felt himself formerly only on the point of joining the new movement, now begins
to feel isolated and in fear of being left alone as he acquires for the first time the picture
of a great community which has a strengthening and encouraging effect on most
people. Brigaded in a company or battalion, surrounded by his companions, he will
march with a lighter heart to the attack than if he had to march alone. In the crowd he
feels himself in some way thus sheltered, though in reality there are a thousand
arguments against such a feeling.

Mass demonstrations on the grand scale not only reinforce the will of the individual but
they draw him still closer to the movement and help to create an ESPRIT DE CORPS.
The man who appears first as the representative of a new doctrine in his place of
business or in his factory is bound to feel himself embarrassed and has need of that
reinforcement which comes from the consciousness that he is a member of a great
community. And only a mass demonstration can impress upon him the greatness of this
community. If, on leaving the shop or mammoth factory, in which he feels very small
indeed, he should enter a vast assembly for the first time and see around him thousands
and thousands of men who hold the same opinions; if, while still seeking his way, he is
gripped by the force of mass-suggestion which comes from the excitement and
enthusiasm of three or four thousand other men in whose midst he finds himself; if the
manifest success and the concensus of thousands confirm the truth and justice of the
new teaching and for the first time raise doubt in his mind as to the truth of the
opinions held by himself up to now--then he submits himself to the fascination of what
we call mass-suggestion. The will, the yearning and indeed the strength of thousands of
people are in each individual. A man who enters such a meeting in doubt and hesitation
leaves it inwardly fortified; he has become a member of a community.
The National Socialist Movement should never forget this, and it should never allow
itself to be influenced by these bourgeois duffers who think they know everything but
who have foolishly gambled away a great State, together with their own existence and
the supremacy of their own class. They are overflowing with ability; they can do 
everything, and they know everything. But there is one thing they have not known how
to do, and that is how to save the German people from falling into the arms of Marxism.
In that they have shown themselves most pitiably and miserably impotent. So that the
present opinion they have of themselves is only equal to their conceit. Their pride and
stupidity are fruits of the same tree.

If these people try to disparage the importance of the spoken word to-day, they do it
only because they realize--God be praised and thanked--how futile all their own
speechifying has been.
