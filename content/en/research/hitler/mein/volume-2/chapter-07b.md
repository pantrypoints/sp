On the other hand, the National Socialist meetings were by no means 'peaceable' affairs.
Two distinct WELTANSCHHAUUNGen raged in bitter opposition to one another, and these meetings did not close with the mechanical rendering of a dull patriotic song but rather with a passionate outbreak of popular national feeling.

It was imperative from the start to introduce rigid discipline into our meetings and establish the authority of the chairman absolutely. Our purpose was not to pour out a mixture of soft-soap bourgeois talk; what we had to say was meant to arouse the
opponents at our meetings! 

How often did they not turn up in masses with a few individual agitators among them and, judging by the expression on all their faces, ready
to finish us off there and then.

Yes, how often did they not turn up in huge numbers, those supporters of the Red Flag, all previously instructed to smash up everything once and for all and put an end to these meetings. 

More often than not everything hung on a mere thread, and only the chairman's ruthless determination and the rough handling by our ushers baffled our adversaries' intentions. 

They had every reason for being irritated.

The fact that we had chosen red as the colour for our posters sufficed to attract them to our meetings. The ordinary bourgeoisie were very shocked to see that, we had also chosen the symbolic red of Bolshevism and they regarded this as something ambiguously significant. 

The suspicion was whispered in German Nationalist circles that we also were merely another variety of Marxism, perhaps even Marxists suitably disguised, or better still, Socialists. 

The actual difference between Socialism and Marxism still remains a mystery to these people up to this day. The charge of Marxism
was conclusively proved when it was discovered that at our meetings we deliberately
substituted the words 'Fellow-countrymen and Women' for 'Ladies and Gentlemen' and
addressed each other as 'Party Comrade'. 

We used to roar with laughter at these silly faint-hearted bourgeoisie and their efforts to puzzle out our origin, our intentions and
our aims.

We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings--if only in order to break them up--so that in this way we got a chance of
talking to the people. 

In those years' it was indeed a delightful experience to follow the constantly changing tactics of our perplexed and helpless adversaries. First of all they appealed to their followers to ignore us and keep away from our meetings. Generally speaking this
appeal was heeded. 

But, as time went on, more and more of their followers gradually found their way to us and accepted our teaching. Then the leaders became nervous and uneasy. 

They clung to their belief that such a development should not be ignored for ever, and that terror must be applied in order to put an end to it. 

Appeals were then made to the 'class-conscious proletariat' to attend our meetings in masses and strike with the clenched hand of the proletarian at the representatives of a 'monarchist and reactionary agitation'.

Our meetings suddenly became packed with work-people fully three-quarters of an hour before the proceedings were scheduled to begin. These gatherings resembled a powder cask ready to explode at any moment; and the fuse was conveniently at hand.

But matters always turned out differently. 

People came as enemies and left, not perhaps prepared to join us, yet in a reflective mood and disposed critically to examine the
correctness of their own doctrine. 

Gradually as time went on my three-hour lectures resulted in supporters and opponents becoming united in one single enthusiastic group
of people. Every signal for the breaking-up of the meeting failed. 

The result was that the opposition leaders became frightened and once again looked for help to those quarters
that had formerly discountenanced these tactics and, with some show of right, had been of the opinion that on principle the workers should be forbidden to attend our meetings.

Then they did not come any more, or only in small numbers. But after a short time the whole game started all over again. The instructions to keep away from us were ignored; the comrades came in steadily increasing numbers, until finally the advocates of the
radical tactics won the day. We were to be broken up.

Yet when, after two, three and even eight meetings, it was realized that to break up these gatherings was easier said than done and that every meeting resulted in a decisive weakening of the red fighting forces, then suddenly the other password was introduced: 'Proletarians, comrades and comradesses, avoid meetings of the National Socialist agitators'.

The same eternally alternating tactics were also to be observed in the Red Press. Soon they tried to silence us but discovered the uselessness of such an attempt. 

After that they swung round to the opposite tactics. Daily 'reference' was made to us solely for the purpose of absolutely ridiculing us in the eyes of the working-classes. After a time these gentlemen must have felt that no harm was being done to us, but that, on the contrary,
we were reaping an advantage in that people were asking themselves why so much space was being devoted to a subject which was supposed to be so ludicrous.

People  became curious. Suddenly there was a change of tactics and for a time we were treated as veritable criminals against mankind. One article followed the other, in which our criminal intentions were explained and new proofs brought forward to support what was said. Scandalous tales, all of them fabricated from start to finish, were published in order to help to poison the public mind. But in a short time even these attacks also proved futile; and in fact they assisted materially because they attracted public attention
to us.

In those days I took up the standpoint that it was immaterial whether they laughed at us or reviled us, whether they depicted us as fools or criminals; the important point was that they took notice of us and that in the eyes of the working-classes we came to be
regarded as the only force capable of putting up a fight. I said to myself that the
followers of the Jewish Press would come to know all about us and our real aims.

One reason why they never got so far as breaking up our meetings was undoubtedly the incredible cowardice displayed by the leaders of the opposition. On every critical occasion they left the dirty work to the smaller fry whilst they waited outside the halls
for the results of the break up.

We were exceptionally well informed in regard to our opponents' intentions, not only because we allowed several of our party colleagues to remain members of the Red organizations for reasons of expediency, but also because the Red wire-pullers,
fortunately for us, were afflicted with a degree of talkativeness that is still unfortunately
very prevalent among Germans.

They could not keep their own counsel, and more often than not they started cackling before the proverbial egg was laid. Hence, time and
again our precautions were such that Red agitators had no inkling of how near they
were to being thrown out of the meetings.

This state of affairs compelled us to take the work of safeguarding our meetings into our own hands. No reliance could be placed on official protection. 

On the contrary; experience showed that such protection always favoured only the disturbers. The only real outcome of police intervention would be that the meeting would be dissolved, that is to say, closed.

That is precisely what our opponents granted.

Generally speaking, this led the police to adopt a procedure which, to say the least, was a most infamous sample of official malpractice. The moment they received information of a threat that the one or other meeting was to be broken up, instead of arresting the would-be disturbers, they promptly advised the innocent parties that the meeting was forbidden. This step the police proclaimed as a 'precautionary measure in the interests of law and order'.

The political work and activities of decent people could therefore always be hindered by desperate ruffians who had the means at their disposal. In the name of peace and order State authority bowed down to these ruffians and demanded that others should
not provoke them. When National Socialism desired to hold meetings in certain parts
and the labour unions declared that their members would resist, then it was not these
blackmailers that were arrested and gaoled. 

No. Our meetings were forbidden by the police. Yes, this organ of the law had the unspeakable impudence to advise us in
writing to this effect in innumerable instances. To avoid such eventualities, it was
necessary to see to it that every attempt to disturb a meeting was nipped in the bud.
Another feature to be taken into account in this respect is that all meetings which rely
on police protection must necessarily bring discredit to their promoters in the eyes of
the general public. Meetings that are only possible with the protective assistance of a
strong force of police convert nobody; because in order to win over the lower strata of
the people there must be a visible show of strength on one's own side. In the same way
that a man of courage will win a woman's affection more easily than a coward, so a
heroic movement will be more successful in winning over the hearts of a people than a
weak movement which relies on police support for its very existence.

It is for this latter reason in particular that our young movement was to be charged with
the responsibility of assuring its own existence, defending itself; and conducting its own
work of smashing the Red opposition.
