Our feckless parliamentarians did not give the people proper training in peacetime.

And so, in 1914, whole armies were composed of volunteers without training. They were thus thrown as defenceless cannon-fodder to the enemy. 


The 400,000 who thus fell or were permanently maimed on the battlefields of Flanders could not be replaced anymore. 

<!-- Their loss was something far more than merely numerical. With their death the scales, which were already too lightly weighed at that end of the social structure which represented our  -->


This reduced our best in human quality, which were replaced by those who constituted the worst extreme of our population.

 <!-- now moved upwards rapidly, becoming heavier on the other end with those vulgar elements of infamy and cowardice--in short, there was an increase in the elements that  -->

While our best human material was being thinned on the battlefields, our worst people wonderfully succeeded in saving themselves. 

For each hero who made the supreme sacrifice and ascended the steps of Valhalla, there was a shirker who cunningly dodged death on the plea of being engaged in business that was useful at home.

The great middle stratum of the nation had fulfilled its duty and paid its toll of blood. 

The best elements had sacrificed itself. 

The worst elements had preserved itself almost intact, through taking advantage of absurd laws and also because the authorities failed to enforce certain articles of the military code.

This scum of our nation then made the Revolution because the best elements were no longer there to oppose it.

<!-- Hence the German Revolution, from the very beginning, depended on only one section of the population. This act of Cain was not committed by the German people as such, but by an obscure CANAILLE of deserters, hooligans, etc. -->

The man at the front gladly welcomed the end of the war so he could return home.

But he had no moral connection with the Revolution. 

He did not like it, nor did he like those who had provoked and organized it. During the four-and-a-half years of that bitter struggle at the front he had come to forget the party hyenas at home and all their wrangling had become foreign to him.

The Revolution was really popular only with a small section of the German people:
namely, that class and their accomplices who had selected the rucksack as the hall-mark
of all honourable citizens in this new State. They did not like the Revolution for its own
sake, though many people still erroneously believe the contrary, but for the
consequences which followed in its train.

But it was very difficult to establish any abiding authority on the popular support given
to these Marxist freebooters. And yet the young Republic stood in need of authority at
any cost, unless it was ready to agree to be overthrown after a short period of chaos by
an elementary force assembled from those last elements that still remained among the
best extreme of the population.

The danger which those who were responsible for the Revolution feared most at that
time was that, in the turmoil of the confusion which they themselves had created, the
ground would suddenly be taken from under their feet, that they might be suddenly
seized and transported to another terrain by an iron grip, such as has often appeared at
these junctures in the history of nations. The Republic must be consolidated at all costs.
Hence it was forced almost immediately after its foundation to erect another pillar
beside that wavering pillar of popularity. They found that power must be organized
once again in order to procure a firmer foundation for their authority.

When those who had been the matadors of the Revolution in December 1918, and
January and February 1919, felt the ground trembling beneath their feet they looked
around them for men who would be ready to reinforce them with military support; for 
their feeble position was dependent only on whatever popular favour they enjoyed. The
'anti-militarist' Republic had need of soldiers. But the first and only pillar on which the
authority of the State rested, namely, its popularity, was grounded only on a
conglomeration of rowdies and thieves, burglars, deserters, shirkers, etc. Therefore in
that section of the nation which we have called the evil extreme it was useless to look
for men who would be willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of a new ideal. The
section which had nourished the revolutionary idea and carried out the Revolution was
neither able nor willing to call on the soldiers to protect it. For that section had no wish
whatsoever to organize a republican State, but to disorganize what already existed and
thus satisfy its own instincts all the better. Their password was not the organization and
construction of the German Republic, but rather the plundering of it.

Hence the cry for help sent out by the public representatives, who were beset by a
thousand anxieties, did not find any response among this class of people, but rather
provoked a feeling of bitterness and repudiation. For they looked upon this step as the
beginning of a breach of faith and trust, and in the building up of an authority which
was no longer based on popular support but also on force they saw the beginning of a
hostile move against what the Revolution meant essentially for those elements. They
feared that measures might be taken against the right to robbery and absolute
domination on the part of a horde of thieves and plunderers--in short, the worst rabble--
who had broken out of the convict prisons and left their chains behind.

The representatives of the people might cry out. But they could get no help from that rabble as they were met with the counter-cry 'traitors' by those very people on whose support the popularity of the regime was founded.

Then for the first time large numbers of young Germans were found who were ready to
button on the military uniform once again in the service of 'Peace and Order', as they
believed, shouldering the carbine and rifle and donning the steel helmet to defend the
wreckers of the Fatherland. Volunteer corps were assembled and, although hating the
Revolution, they began to defend it. The practical effect of their action was to render the
Revolution firm and stable. In doing this they acted in perfect good faith.
