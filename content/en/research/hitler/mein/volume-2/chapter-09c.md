The real organizer of the Revolution and the actual wire-puller behind it, the
international Jew, had sized up the situation correctly. The German people were not yet
ripe to be drawn into the blood swamp of Bolshevism, as the Russian people had been
drawn. And that was because there was a closer racial union between the intellectual
classes in Germany and the manual workers, and also because broad social strata were
permeated with cultured people, such as was the case also in the other States of Western
Europe; but this state of affairs was completely lacking in Russia. In that country the
intellectual classes were mostly not of Russian nationality, or at least they did not have
the racial characteristics of the Slav. The thin upper layer of intellectuals which then
existed in Russia might be abolished at any time, because there was no intermediate 
stratum connecting it organically with the great mass of the people. There the mental
and moral level of the great mass of the people was frightfully low.

In Russia the moment the agitators were successful in inciting broad masses of the
people, who could not read or write, against the upper layer of intellectuals who were
not in contact with the masses or permanently linked with them in any way--at that
moment the destiny of Russia was decided, the success of the Revolution was assured.
Thereupon the analphabetic Russian became the slave of his Jewish dictators who, on
their side, were shrewd enough to name their dictatorship 'The Dictatorship of the
People'.


In the case of Germany an additional factor must be taken into account. Here the Revolution could be carried into effect only if the Army could first be gradually dismembered. But the real author of the Revolution and of the process of disintegration in the Army was not the soldier who had fought at the front but the CANAILLE which more or less shunned the light and which were either quartered in the home garrisons or were officiating as 'indispensables' somewhere in the business world at home.

This army was reinforced by ten thousand deserters who, without running any particular risk, could turn their backs on the Front. At all times the real poltroon fears nothing so much as death. But at the Front he had death before his eyes every day in a thousand different shapes. There has always been one possible way, and one only, of making weak or wavering men, or even downright poltroons, face their duty steadfastly. This means that the deserter must be given to understand that his desertion will bring upon him just the very thing he is flying from. At the Front a man may die, but the deserter MUST die. Only this draconian threat against every attempt to desert the flag can have a terrifying effect, not merely on the individual but also on the mass. Therein lay the meaning and purpose of the military penal code.

It was a fine belief to think that the great struggle for the life of a nation could be carried through if it were based solely on voluntary fidelity arising from and sustained by the knowledge that such a struggle was necessary. The voluntary fulfilment of one's duty is a motive that determines the actions of only the best men, but not of the average type of men. Hence special laws are necessary; just as, for instance, the law against stealing, which was not made for men who are honest on principle but for the weak and unstable elements. Such laws are meant to hinder the evil-doer through their deterrent effect and thus prevent a state of affairs from arising in which the honest man is considered the more stupid, and which would end in the belief that it is better to have a share in the robbery than to stand by with empty hands or allow oneself to be robbed.

It was a mistake to believe that in a struggle which, according to all human foresight,
might last for several years it would be possible to dispense with those expedients
which the experience of hundreds and even of thousands of years had proved to be 
effective in making weak and unstable men face and fulfil their duty in difficult times
and at moments of great nervous stress.

For the voluntary war hero it is, of course, not necessary to have the death penalty in
the military code, but it is necessary for the cowardly egoists who value their own lives
more than the existence of the community in the hour of national need. Such weak and
characterless people can be held back from surrendering to their cowardice only by the
application of the heaviest penalties. When men have to struggle with death every day
and remain for weeks in trenches of mire, often very badly supplied with food, the man
who is unsure of himself and begins to waver cannot be made to stick to his post by
threats of imprisonment or even penal servitude. Only by a ruthless enforcement of the
death penalty can this be effected. For experience shows that at such a time the recruit
considers prison a thousand times more preferable than the battlefield. In prison at least
his precious life is not in danger. The practical abolition of the death penalty during the
war was a mistake for which we had to pay dearly. Such omission really meant that the
military penal code was no longer recognized as valid. An army of deserters poured
into the stations at the rear or returned home, especially in 1918, and there began to
form that huge criminal organization with which we were suddenly faced, after
November 7th, 1918, and which perpetrated the Revolution.

The Front had nothing to do with all this. Naturally, the soldiers at the Front were
yearning for peace. But it was precisely that fact which represented a special danger for
the Revolution. For when the German soldiers began to draw near home, after the
Armistice, the revolutionaries were in trepidation and asked the same question again
and again: What will the troops from the Front do? Will the field-greys stand for it?
During those weeks the Revolution was forced to give itself at least an external
appearance of moderation, if it were not to run the risk of being wrecked in a moment
by a few German divisions. For at that time, even if the commander of one division
alone had made up his mind to rally the soldiers of his division, who had always
remained faithful to him, in an onslaught to tear down the red flag and put the
'councils' up against the wall, or, if there was any resistance, to break it with trenchmortars and hand grenades, that division would have grown into an army of sixty divisions in less than four weeks. The Jew wire-pullers were terrified by this prospect more than by anything else; and to forestall this particular danger they found it
necessary to give the Revolution a certain aspect of moderation. They dared not allow it
to degenerate into Bolshevism, so they had to face the existing conditions by putting up
the hypocritical picture of 'order and tranquillity'. Hence many important concessions,
the appeal to the old civil service and to the heads of the old Army. They would be
needed at least for a certain time, and only when they had served the purpose of Turks'
Heads could the deserved kick-out be administered with impunity. Then the Republic
would be taken entirely out of the hands of the old servants of the State and delivered
into the claws of the revolutionaries. 

They thought that this was the only plan which would succeed in duping the old
generals and civil servants and disarm any eventual opposition beforehand through the
apparently harmless and mild character of the new regime.
Practical experience has shown to what extent the plan succeeded.
The Revolution, however, was not made by the peaceful and orderly elements of the
nation but rather by rioters, thieves and robbers. And the way in which the Revolution
was developing did not accord with the intentions of these latter elements; still, on
tactical grounds, it was not possible to explain to them the reasons for the course things
were taking and make that course acceptable.

As Social Democracy gradually gained power it lost more and more the character of a
crude revolutionary party. Of course in their inner hearts the Social Democrats wanted
a revolution; and their leaders had no other end in view. Certainly not. But what finally
resulted was only a revolutionary programme; but not a body of men who would be
able to carry it out. A revolution cannot be carried through by a party of ten million
members. If such a movement were attempted the leaders would find that it was not an
extreme section of the population on which they had to depend butrather the broad
masses of the middle stratum; hence the inert masses.

Recognizing all this, already during the war, the Jews caused the famous split in the
Social Democratic Party. While the Social Democratic Party, conforming to the inertia of
its mass following, clung like a leaden weight on the neck of the national defence, the
actively radical elements were extracted from it and formed into new aggressive
columns for purposes of attack. The Independent Socialist Party and the Spartacist
League were the storm battalions of revolutionary Marxism. The objective assigned to
them was to create a FAIT ACCOMPLI, on the grounds of which the masses of the
Social Democratic Party could take their stand, having been prepared for this event long
beforehand. The feckless bourgeoisie had been estimated at its just value by the
Marxists and treated EN CANAILLE. Nobody bothered about it, knowing well that in
their canine servility the representatives of an old and worn-out generation would not
be able to offer any serious resistance.

When the Revolution had succeeded and its artificers believed that the main pillars of
the old State had been broken down, the Army returning from the Front began to
appear in the light of a sinister sphinx and thus made it necessary to slow down the
national course of the Revolution. The main body of the Social Democratic horde
occupied the conquered positions, and the Independent Socialist and Spartacist storm
battalions were side-tracked.
But that did not happen without a struggle. 

The activist assault formations that had started the Revolution were dissatisfied and felt
that they had been betrayed. They now wanted to continue the fight on their own
account. But their illimitable racketeering became odious even to the wire-pullers of the
Revolution. For the Revolution itself had scarcely been accomplished when two camps
appeared. In the one camp were the elements of peace and order; in the other were
those of blood and terror. Was it not perfectly natural that our bourgeoisie should rush
with flying colours to the camp of peace and order? For once in their lives their piteous
political organizations found it possible to act, inasmuch as the ground had been
prepared for them on which they were glad to get a new footing; and thus to a certain
extent they found themselves in coalition with that power which they hated but feared.
The German political bourgeoisie achieved the high honour of being able to associate
itself with the accursed Marxist leaders for the purpose of combating Bolshevism.
Thus the following state of affairs took shape as early as December 1918 and January
1919:
