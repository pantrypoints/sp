A minority constituted of the worst elements had made the Revolution. 

Behind this minority all the Marxist parties immediately fell into step. The Revolution itself had an
outward appearance of moderation, which aroused against it the enmity of the fanatical
extremists. These began to launch hand-grenades and fire machine-guns, occupying
public buildings, thus threatening to destroy the moderate appearance of the
Revolution. 

To prevent this terror from developing further a truce was concluded between the representatives of the new regime and the adherents of the old order, so as to be able to wage a common fight against the extremists. The result was that the enemies of the Republic ceased to oppose the Republic as such and helped to subjugate
those who were also enemies of the Republic, though for quite different reasons. But a
further result was that all danger of the adherents of the old State putting up a fight
against the new was now definitely averted.

This fact must always be clearly kept in mind. Only by remembering it can we understand how it was possible that a nation in which nine-tenths of the people had not joined in a revolution, where seven-tenths repudiated it and six-tenths detested it--how this nation allowed the Revolution to be imposed upon it by the remaining one-tenth of
the population.

Gradually the barricade heroes in the Spartacist camp petered out, and so did the
nationalist patriots and idealists on the other side. As these two groups steadily
dwindled, the masses of the middle stratum, as always happens, triumphed. The
Bourgeoisie and the Marxists met together on the grounds of accomplished facts, and
the Republic began to be consolidated. At first, however, that did not prevent the
bourgeois parties from propounding their monarchist ideas for some time further,
especially at the elections, whereby they endeavoured to conjure up the spirits of the 
dead past to encourage their own feeble-hearted followers. It was not an honest
proceeding. In their hearts they had broken with the monarchy long ago; but the
foulness of the new regime had begun to extend its corruptive action and make itself
felt in the camp of the bourgeois parties. The common bourgeois politician now felt
better in the slime of republican corruption than in the severe decency of the defunct
State, which still lived in his memory.

As I have already pointed out, after the destruction of the old Army the revolutionary
leaders were forced to strengthen statal authority by creating a new factor of power. In
the conditions that existed they could do this only by winning over to their side the
adherents of a WELTANSCHAUUNG which was a direct contradiction of their own.
From those elements alone it was possible slowly to create a new army which, limited
numerically by the peace treaties, had to be subsequently transformed in spirit so as to
become an instrument of the new regime.

The defects of the old State really caused the Revolution.

The Revolution succeeded politically because:

1. It was due to a process of dry rot in our conceptions of duty and obedience.
2. It was due also to the passive timidity of the Parties who were supposed to uphold
the State.


The dry rot which attacked our concepts of duty and obedience was fundamentally due to our wholly non-national and purely State education. From this came the habit of confusing means and ends. Consciousness of
duty, fulfilment of duty, and obedience, are not ends in themselves no more than the
State is an end in itself; but they all ought to be employed as means to facilitate and
assure the existence of a community of people who are kindred both physically and
spiritually. At a moment when a nation is manifestly collapsing and when all outward
signs show that it is on the point of becoming the victim of ruthless oppression, thanks
to the conduct of a few miscreants, to obey these people and fulfil one's duty towards
them is merely doctrinaire formalism, and indeed pure folly; whereas, on the other
hand, the refusal of obedience and fulfilment of duty in such a case might save the
nation from collapse. According to our current bourgeois idea of the State, if a
divisional general received from above the order not to shoot he fulfilled his duty and
therefore acted rightly in not shooting, because to the bourgeois mind blind formal
obedience is a more valuable thing than the life of a nation. But according to the
National Socialist concept it is not obedience to weak superiors that should prevail at
such moments, in such an hour the duty of assuming personal responsibility towards
the whole nation makes its appearance.

The Revolution succeeded because that concept had ceased to be a vital force with our
people, or rather with our governments, and died down to something that was merely
formal and doctrinaire.

As regards the second point, it may be said that the more profound cause of the
fecklessness of the bourgeois parties must be attributed to the fact that the most active
and upright section of our people had lost their lives in the war. Apart from that, the
bourgeois parties, which may be considered as the only political formations that stood
by the old State, were convinced that they ought to defend their principles only by
intellectual ways and means, since the use of physical force was permitted only to the
State. That outlook was a sign of the weakness and decadence which had been
gradually developing. And it was also senseless at a period when there was a political
adversary who had long ago abandoned that standpoint and, instead of this, had
openly declared that he meant to attain his political ends by force whenever that
became possible. When Marxism emerged in the world of bourgeois democracy, as a
consequence of that democracy itself, the appeal sent out by the bourgeois democracy
to fight Marxism with intellectual weapons was a piece of folly for which a terrible
expiation had to be made later on. For Marxism always professed the doctrine that the
use of arms was a matter which had to be judged from the standpoint of expediency
and that success justified the use of arms.

This idea was proved correct during the days from November 7 to 10, 1918. The
Marxists did not then bother themselves in the least about parliament or democracy,
but they gave the death blow to both by turning loose their horde of criminals to shoot
and raise hell.

When the Revolution was over the bourgeois parties changed the title of their firm and
suddenly reappeared, the heroic leaders emerging from dark cellars or more lightsome
storehouses where they had sought refuge. But, just as happens in the case of all
representatives of antiquated institutions, they had not forgotten their errors or learned
anything new. Their political programme was grounded in the past, even though they
themselves had become reconciled to the new regime. Their aim was to secure a share
in the new establishment, and so they continued the use of words as their sole weapon.
Therefore after the Revolution the bourgeois parties also capitulated to the street in a
miserable fashion.

When the law for the Protection of the Republic was introduced the majority was not at
first in favour of it. But, confronted with two hundred thousand Marxists
demonstrating in the streets, the bourgeois 'statesmen' were so terror-stricken that they
voted for the Law against their wills, for the edifying reason that otherwise they feared
they might get their heads smashed by the enraged masses on leaving the Reichstag. 
And so the new State developed along its own course, as if there had been no national
opposition at all.

The only organizations which at that time had the strength and courage to face
Marxism and its enraged masses were first of all the volunteer corps (Note 19), and
subsequently the organizations for self-defence, the civic guards and finally the
associations formed by the demobilized soldiers of the old Army.

But the existence of these bodies did not appreciably change the course of German
history; and that for the following causes:
As the so-called national parties were without influence, because they had no force
which could effectively demonstrate in the street, the Leagues of Defence could not
exercise any influence because they had no political idea and especially because they
had no definite political aim in view.

The success which Marxism once attained was due to perfect co-operation between
political purposes and ruthless force. What deprived nationalist Germany of all
practical hopes of shaping German development was the lack of a determined cooperation between brute force and political aims wisely chosen.

Whatever may have been the aspirations of the 'national' parties, they had no force
whatsoever to fight for these aspirations, least of all in the streets.
The Defence Leagues had force at their disposal. They were masters of the street and of
the State, but they lacked political ideas and aims on behalf of which their forces might
have been or could have been employed in the interests of the German nation. The
cunning Jew was able in both cases, by his astute powers of persuasion, in reinforcing
an already existing tendency to make this unfortunate state of affairs permanent and at
the same time to drive the roots of it still deeper.


The Jew succeeded brilliantly in using his Press for the purpose of spreading abroad the
idea that the defence associations were of a 'non-political' character just as in politics he
was always astute enough to praise the purely intellectual character of the struggle and
demand that it must always be kept on that plane
Millions of German imbeciles then repeated this folly without having the slightest
suspicion that by so doing they were, for all practical purposes, disarming themselves
and delivering themselves defenceless into the hands of the Jew.
But there is a natural explanation of this also. The lack of a great idea which would reshape things anew has always meant a limitation in fighting power. The conviction of 
the right to employ even the most brutal weapons is always associated with an ardent
faith in the necessity for a new and revolutionary transformation of the world.
A movement which does not fight for such high aims and ideals will never have
recourse to extreme means.

The appearance of a new and great idea was the secret of success in the French
Revolution. The Russian Revolution owes its triumph to an idea. And it was only the
idea that enabled Fascism triumphantly to subject a whole nation to a process of
complete renovation.

Bourgeois parties are not capable of such an achievement. And it was not the bourgeois
parties alone that fixed their aim in a restoration of the past. The defence associations
also did so, in so far as they concerned themselves with political aims at all. The spirit of
the old war legions and Kyffauser tendencies lived in them and therewith helped
politically to blunt the sharpest weapons which the German nation then possessed and
allow them to rust in the hands of republican serfs. The fact that these associations were
inspired by the best of intentions in so doing, and certainly acted in good faith, does not
alter in the slightest degree the foolishness of the course they adopted.
In the consolidated REICHSWEHR Marxism gradually acquired the support of force,
which it needed for its authority. As a logical consequence it proceeded to abolish those
defence associations which it considered dangerous, declaring that they were now no
longer necessary. Some rash leaders who defied the Marxist orders were summoned to
court and sent to prison. But they all got what they had deserved.
The founding of the National Socialist German Labour Party incited a movement which
was the first to fix its aim, not in a mechanical restoration of the past--as the bourgeois
parties did--but in the substitution of an organic People's State for the present absurd
statal mechanism.
