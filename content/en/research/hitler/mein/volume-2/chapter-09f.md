Practically, it is impossible to build up a national defence organization through private associations, unless the State makes an enormous contribution to it. 

Whoever thinks otherwise overestimates his own powers. Now it is entirely out of the question to form organizations of any military value for a definite purpose on the principle of so-called 'voluntary discipline'. 

Here the chief support for enforcing orders, namely, the power of inflicting punishment, is lacking. In the autumn, or rather in the spring, of 1919 it was still possible to raise 'volunteer corps', not only because most of the men who came forward at that time had been through the school of the old Army, but also because the kind of duty imposed there constrained the individual to absolute obedience at least for a definite period of time.

That spirit is entirely lacking in the volunteer defence organizations of to-day. The more
the defence association grows, the weaker its discipline becomes and so much the less
can one demand from the individual members. Thus the whole organization will more
and more assume the character of the old non-political associations of war comrades
and veterans.

It is impossible to carry through a voluntary training in military service for larger
masses unless one is assured absolute power of command. There will always be few
men who will voluntarily and spontaneously submit to that kind of obedience which is
considered natural and necessary in the Army.

Moreover, a proper system of military training cannot be developed where there are
such ridiculously scanty means as those at the disposal of the defence associations. The
principal task of such an institution must be to impart the best and most reliable kind of
instruction. Eight years have passed since the end of the War, and during that time
none of our German youth, at an age when formerly they would have had to do
military service, have received any systematic training at all. The aim of a defence
association cannot be to enlist here and now all those who have already received a
military training; for in that case it could be reckoned with mathematical accuracy when
the last member would leave the association. Even the younger soldier from 1918 will
no longer be fit for front-line service twenty years later, and we are approaching that 
state of things with a rapidity that gives cause for anxiety. Thus the defence associations
must assume more and more the aspect of the old ex-service men's societies. But that
cannot be the meaning and purpose of an institution which calls itself, not an
association of ex-service men but a DEFENCE association, indicating by this title that it
considers its task to be, not only to preserve the tradition of the old soldiers and hold
them together but also to propagate the idea of national defence and be able to carry
this idea into practical effect, which means the creation of a body of men who are fit and
trained for military defence.

But this implies that those elements will receive a military training which up to now
have received none. This is something that in practice is impossible for the defence
associations. Real soldiers cannot be made by a training of one or two hours per week.
In view of the enormously increasing demands which modern warfare imposes on each
individual soldier to-day, a military service of two years is barely sufficient to transform
a raw recruit into a trained soldier. At the Front during the War we all saw the fearful
consequences which our young recruits had to suffer from their lack of a thorough
military training. Volunteer formations which had been drilled for fifteen or twenty
weeks under an iron discipline and shown unlimited self-denial proved nevertheless to
be no better than cannon fodder at the Front. Only when distributed among the ranks of
the old and experienced soldiers could the young recruits, who had been trained for
four or six months, become useful members of a regiment. Guided by the 'old men',
they adapted themselves gradually to their task.

It is hopeless to create a body of troops by 2 hours per week training without any:
- definite power of command
- considerable means

<!-- In that way perhaps one could refresh military training in old soldiers, but raw recruits cannot thus be
transformed into expert soldiers. -->

This produces utterly worthless results as seen in volunteer defence associations.

They complain of difficulties and lack of necessities. So they educate and train a few thousand men of goodwill for national defence.

The State teaches our young men democratic and pacifist ideas and thus:
- deprives them of their national instincts
- poisons their logical sense of patriotism
- gradually turns them into a herd of sheep 

<!-- Almost more important is the following consideration, which has always made me take
up a stand against all attempts at a so-called military training on the basis of the
volunteer associations.  -->

Even if a defence association were able to train a number of Germans every year to be efficient soldiers,
not only as regards their mental outlook but also as regards bodily efficiency and the
expert handling of arms, the result must necessarily be null and void in a State whose
whole tendency makes it not only look upon such a defensive formation as undesirable
but even positively hate it, because such an association would completely contradict the
intimate aims of the political leaders, who are the corrupters of this State.

But anyhow, such a result would be worthless under governments which have
demonstrated by their own acts that they do not lay the slightest importance on the
military power of the nation and are not disposed to permit an appeal to that power
only in case that it were necessary for the protection of their own malignant existence.
And that is the state of affairs to-day. It is not ridiculous to think of training some ten
thousand men in the use of arms, and carry on that training surreptitiously, when a few
years previously the State, having shamefully sacrificed eight-and-a-half million highly
trained soldiers, not merely did not require their services any more, but, as a mark of
gratitude for their sacrifices, held them up to public contumely. 

Shall we train soldiers for a regime which besmirched and spat upon our most glorious soldiers, tore the
medals and badges from their breasts, trampled on their flags and derided their
achievements? 

Has the present regime taken one step towards restoring the honour of
the old army and bringing those who destroyed and outraged it to answer for their
deeds? Not in the least. On the contrary, the people I have just referred to may be seen
enthroned in the highest positions under the State to-day. And yet it was said at
Leipzig: "Right goes with might." Since, however, in our Republic to-day might is in the
hands of the very men who arranged for the Revolution, and since that Revolution
represents a most despicable act of high treason against the nation--yea, the vilest act in
German history--there can surely be no grounds for saying that might of this character
should be enhanced by the formation of a new young army. It is against all sound
reason.

The importance which this State attached, after the Revolution of 1918, to the
reinforcement of its position from the military point of view is clearly and unmistakably
demonstrated by its attitude towards the large self-defence organizations which existed
in that period. They were not unwelcome as long as they were of use for the personal
protection of the miserable creatures cast up by the Revolution.
But the danger to these creatures seemed to disappear as the debasement of our people
gradually increased. As the existence of the defence associations no longer implied a
reinforcement of the national policy they became superfluous. Hence every effort was
made to disarm them and suppress them wherever that was possible. 

History records only a few examples of gratitude on the part of princes. But there is not
one patriot among the new bourgeoisie who can count on the gratitude of revolutionary
incendiaries and assassins, persons who have enriched themselves from the public spoil
and betrayed the nation. In examining the problem as to the wisdom of forming these
defence associations I have never ceased to ask: 'For whom shall I train these young
men? For what purpose will they be employed when they will have to be called out?'
The answer to these questions lays down at the same time the best rule for us to follow.


If the present State should one day have to call upon trained troops of this kind, it would never be for the purpose of defending the interests of the nation VIS-À-VIS those of the stranger but rather to protect the oppressors of the nation inside the country against the danger of a general outbreak of wrath on the part of a nation which has been
deceived and betrayed and whose interests have been bartered away.

This is why it was decided that the Storm Detachment of the German National Socialist Labour Party should not be a military organization. 

It had to be an instrument of protection and education for the National Socialist Movement.

Its duties should be in quite a different sphere from that of the military defence association.
