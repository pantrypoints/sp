IN THE winter of 1919, and still more in the spring and summer of 1920, the young
Party felt bound to take up a definite stand on a question which already had become
quite serious during the War. 

In volume 1 of this book, I have briefly recorded certain facts which I had personally witnessed and which foreboded the break-up of Germany. 

In describing these facts I made reference to the special nature of the propaganda which was directed by the English as well as the French towards reopening the breach that had existed between North and South in Germany. In the spring of 1915 there appeared the first of a series of leaflets which was systematically followed up and the aim of which was to arouse feeling against Prussia as being solely responsible for the war. Up to 1916 this system had been developed and perfected in a cunning and
shameless manner. 

Appealing to the basest of human instincts, this propaganda endeavoured to arouse the wrath of the South Germans against the North Germans and after a short time it bore fruit. Persons who were then in high positions under the
Government and in the Army, especially those attached to headquarters in the Bavarian
Army, merited the just reproof of having blindly neglected their duty and failed to take
the necessary steps to counter such propaganda. But nothing was done. 

On the contrary, in some quarters it did not appear to be quite unwelcome and probably they
were short-sighted enough to think that such propaganda might help along the
development of unification in Germany but even that it might automatically bring
about consolidation of the federative forces. 

Scarcely ever in history was such a wicked neglect more wickedly avenged. The weakening of Prussia, which they believed would result from this propaganda, affected the whole of Germany. It resulted in hastening the
collapse which not only wrecked Germany as a whole but even more particularly the
federal states.

In that town where the artificially created hatred against Prussia raged most violently
the revolt against the reigning House was the beginning of the Revolution.
It would be a mistake to think that the enemy propaganda was exclusively responsible
for creating an anti-Prussian feeling and that there were no reasons which might excuse
the people for having listened to this propaganda. 

The incredible fashion in which the national economic interests were organized during the War, the absolutely crazy system of centralization which made the whole REICH its ward and exploited the REICH, 
furnished the principal grounds for the growth of that anti-Prussian feeling. The
average citizen looked upon the companies for the placing of war contracts, all of which
had their headquarters in Berlin, as identical with Berlin and Berlin itself as identical
with Prussia. 

The average citizen did not know that the organization of these robber companies, which were called War Companies, was not in the hands of Berlin or Prussia and not even in German hands at all. People recognized only the gross irregularities and the continual encroachments of that hated institution in the
Metropolis of the REICH and directed their anger towards Berlin and Prussia, all the
more because in certain quarters (the Bavarian Government) nothing was done to
correct this attitude, but it was even welcomed with silent rubbing of hands.
The Jew was far too shrewd not to understand that the infamous campaign which he
had organized, under the cloak of War Companies, for plundering the German nation
would and must eventually arouse opposition. As long as that opposition did not
spring directly at his own throat he had no reason to be afraid. Hence he decided that
the best way of forestalling an outbreak on the part of the enraged and desperate
masses would be to inflame their wrath and at the same time give it another outlet.
Let Bavaria quarrel as much as it liked with Prussia and Prussia with Bavaria. The
more, the merrier. This bitter strife between the two states assured peace to the Jew.
Thus public attention was completely diverted from the international maggot in the
body of the nation; indeed, he seemed to have been forgotten. Then when there came a
danger that level-headed people, of whom there are many to be found also in Bavaria,
would advise a little more reserve and a more judicious evaluation of things, thus
calming the rage against Prussia, all the Jew had to do in Berlin was to stage a new
provocation and await results. Every time that was done all those who had profiteered
out of the conflict between North and South filled their lungs and again fanned the
flame of indignation until it became a blaze.

It was a shrewd and expert manoeuvre on the part of the Jew, to set the different
branches of the German people quarrelling with one another, so that their attention
would be turned away from himself and he could plunder them all the more
completely.

Then came the Revolution.
Until the year 1918, or rather until the November of that year, the average German
citizen, particularly the less educated lower middle-class and the workers, did not
rightly understand what was happening and did not realize what must be the inevitable
consequences, especially for Bavaria, of this internecine strife between the branches of
the German people; but at least those sections which called themselves 'National' ought
to have clearly perceived these consequences on the day that the Revolution broke out.
For the moment the COUP D'ÉTAT had succeeded, the leader and organizer of the 
Revolution in Bavaria put himself forward as the defender of 'Bavarian' interests. The
international Jew, Kurt Eisner, began to play off Bavaria against Prussia. This Oriental
was just about the last person in the world that could be pointed to as the logical
defender of Bavarian interests. In his trade as newspaper reporter he had wandered
from place to place all over Germany and to him it was a matter of sheer indifference
whether Bavaria or any other particular part of God's whole world continued to exist.
In deliberately giving the revolutionary rising in Bavaria the character of an offensive
against Prussia, Kurt Eisner was not acting in the slightest degree from the standpoint
of Bavarian interests, but merely as the commissioned representative of Jewry. He
exploited existing instincts and antipathies in Bavaria as a means which would help to
make the dismemberment of Germany all the more easy. When once dismembered, the
REICH would fall an easy prey to Bolshevism.

The tactics employed by him were continued for a time after his death. The Marxists,
who had always derided and exploited the individual German states and their princes,
now suddenly appealed, as an 'Independent Party' to those sentiments and instincts
which had their strongest roots in the families of the reigning princes and the individual
states.

The fight waged by the Bavarian Soviet Republic against the military contingents that
were sent to free Bavaria from its grasp was represented by the Marxist propagandists
as first of all the 'Struggle of the Bavarian Worker' against 'Prussian Militarism.' This
explains why it was that the suppression of the Soviet Republic in Munich did not have
the same effect there as in the other German districts. Instead of recalling the masses to
a sense of reason, it led to increased bitterness and anger against Prussia.
The art of the Bolshevik agitators, in representing the suppression of the Bavarian
Soviet Republic as a victory of 'Prussian Militarism' over the 'Anti-militarists' and 'AntiPrussian' people of Bavaria, bore rich fruit. Whereas on the occasion of the elections to the Bavarian Legislative Diet, Kurt Eisner did not have ten thousand followers in
Munich and the Communist party less than three thousand, after the fall of the Bavarian
Republic the votes given to the two parties together amounted to nearly one hundred
thousand.

It was then that I personally began to combat that crazy incitement of some branches of
the German people against other branches.

I believe that never in my life did I undertake a more unpopular task than I did when I
took my stand against the anti-Prussian incitement. During the Soviet regime in Munich
great public meetings were held at which hatred against the rest of Germany, but
particularly against Prussia, was roused up to such a pitch that a North German would
have risked his life in attending one of those meetings. These meetings often ended in 
wild shouts: "Away from Prussia", "Down with the Prussians", "War against Prussia",
and so on. This feeling was openly expressed in the Reichstag by a particularly brilliant
defender of Bavarian sovereign rights when he said: "Rather die as a Bavarian than rot
as a Prussian".

One should have attended some of the meetings held at that time in order to
understand what it meant for one when, for the first time and surrounded by only a
handful of friends, I raised my voice against this folly at a meeting held in the Munich
Löwenbräu Keller. Some of my War comrades stood by me then. And it is easy to
imagine how we felt when that raging crowd, which had lost all control of its reason,
roared at us and threatened to kill us. During the time that we were fighting for the
country the same crowd were for the most part safely ensconced in the rear positions or
were peacefully circulating at home as deserters and shirkers. It is true that that scene
turned out to be of advantage to me. My small band of comrades felt for the first time
absolutely united with me and readily swore to stick by me through life and death.
These conflicts, which were constantly repeated in 1919, seemed to become more violent
soon after the beginning of 1920. There were meetings--I remember especially one in the
Wagner Hall in the Sonnenstrasse in Munich--during the course of which my group,
now grown much larger, had to defend themselves against assaults of the most violent
character. It happened more than once that dozens of my followers were mishandled,
thrown to the floor and stamped upon by the attackers and were finally thrown out of
the hall more dead than alive.

<!-- The struggle which I had undertaken, first by myself alone and afterwards with the
support of my war comrades, was now continued by the young movement, I might say
almost as a sacred mission. -->
