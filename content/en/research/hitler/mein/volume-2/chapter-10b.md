I am proud to say that we put an end to the coalition of folly and treason almost exclusively through our followers in Bavaria.

The masses who joined that coalition meant well but were stupid.

I cannot attribute such simplicity as an extenuating circumstance in the case of the organizers and their
abetters. I then looked upon them, and still look upon them to-day, as traitors in the
payment of France. In one case, that of Dorten, history has already pronounced its
judgment.

The situation became specially dangerous at that time by reason of the fact that they
were very astute in their ability to cloak their real tendencies, by insisting primarily on
their federative intentions and claiming that those were the sole motives of the
agitation. 

Of course it is quite obvious that the agitation against Prussia had nothing to
do with federalism. Surely 'Federal Activities' is not the phrase with which to describe
an effort to dissolve and dismember another federal state. For an honest federalist, for 
whom the formula used by Bismarck to define his idea of the REICH is not a counterfeit
phrase, could not in the same breath express the desire to cut off portions of the
Prussian State, which was created or at least completed by Bismarck. Nor could he
publicly support such a separatist attempt.

What an outcry would be raised in Munich if some prussian conservative party
declared itself in favour of detaching Franconia from Bavaria or took public action in
demanding and promoting such a separatist policy. Nevertheless, one can only have
sympathy for all those real and honest federalists who did not see through this
infamous swindle, for they were its principal victims. By distorting the federalist idea in
such a way its own champions prepared its grave. One cannot make propaganda for a
federalist configuration of the REICH by debasing and abusing and besmirching the
essential element of such a political structure, namely Prussia, and thus making such a
Confederation impossible, if it ever had been possible. It is all the more incredible by
reason of the fact that the fight carried on by those so-called federalists was directed
against that section of the Prussian people which was the last that could be looked upon
as connected with the November democracy. For the abuse and attacks of these socalled federalists were not levelled against the fathers of the Weimar Constitution--the majority of whom were South Germans or Jews--but against those who represented the old conservative Prussia, which was the antipodes of the Weimar Constitution. The fact
that the directors of this campaign were careful not to touch the Jews is not to be
wondered at and perhaps gives the key to the whole riddle.

Before the Revolution the Jew was successful in distracting attention from himself and
his War Companies by inciting the masses, and especially the Bavarians, against
Prussia. Similarly he felt obliged, after the Revolution, to find some way of
camouflaging his new plunder campaign which was nine or ten times greater. And
again he succeeded, in this case by provoking the so-called 'national' elements against
one another: the conservative Bavarians against the Prussians, who were just as
conservative. He acted again with extreme cunning, inasmuch as he who held the reins
of Prussia's destiny in his hands provoked such crude and tactless aggressions that
again and again they set the blood boiling in those who were being continually duped.
Never against the Jew, however, but always the German against his own brother. The
Bavarian did not see the Berlin of four million industrious and efficient working people,
but only the lazy and decadent Berlin which is to be found in the worst quarters of the
West End. And his antipathy was not directed against this West End of Berlin but
against the 'Prussian' city.

In many cases it tempted one to despair.
The ability which the Jew has displayed in turning public attention away from himself
and giving it another direction may be studied also in what is happening to-day. 
In 1918 there was nothing like an organized anti-Semitic feeling. I still remember the
difficulties we encountered the moment we mentioned the Jew. We were either
confronted with dumb-struck faces or else a lively and hefty antagonism.

The efforts we made at the time to point out the real enemy to the public seemed to be doomed to
failure. But then things began to change for the better, though only very slowly. The
'League for Defence and Offence' was defectively organized but at least it had the great
merit of opening up the Jewish question once again. In the winter of 1918-1919 a kind of
anti-semitism began slowly to take root. Later on the National Socialist Movement
presented the Jewish problem in a new light. Taking the question beyond the restricted
circles of the upper classes and small bourgeoisie we succeeded in transforming it into
the driving motive of a great popular movement. But the moment we were successful in
placing this problem before the German people in the light of an idea that would unite
them in one struggle the Jew reacted. He resorted to his old tactics. With amazing
alacrity he hurled the torch of discord into the patriotic movement and opened a rift
there. In bringing forward the ultramontane question and in the mutual quarrels that it
gave rise to between Catholicism and Protestantism lay the sole possibility, as
conditions then were, of occupying public attention with other problems and thus ward
off the attack which had been concentrated against Jewry. The men who dragged our
people into this controversy can never make amends for the crime they then committed
against the nation. Anyhow, the Jew has attained the ends he desired. Catholics and
Protestants are fighting with one another to their hearts' content, while the enemy of
Aryan humanity and all Christendom is laughing up his sleeve.

Once it was possible to occupy the attention of the public for several years with the
struggle between federalism and unification, wearing out their energies in this mutual
friction while the Jew trafficked in the freedom of the nation and sold our country to the
masters of international high finance. So in our day he has succeeded again, this time by
raising ructions between the two German religious denominations while the
foundations on which both rest are being eaten away and destroyed through the poison
injected by the international and cosmopolitan Jew.

Look at the ravages from which our people are suffering daily as a result of being
contaminated with Jewish blood. Bear in mind the fact that this poisonous
contamination can be eliminated from the national body only after centuries, or perhaps
never. Think further of how the process of racial decomposition is debasing and in
some cases even destroying the fundamental Aryan qualities of our German people, so
that our cultural creativeness as a nation is gradually becoming impotent and we are
running the danger, at least in our great cities, of falling to the level where Southern
Italy is to-day. This pestilential adulteration of the blood, of which hundreds of
thousands of our people take no account, is being systematically practised by the Jew
to-day. Systematically these negroid parasites in our national body corrupt our innocent
fair-haired girls and thus destroy something which can no longer be replaced in this
world. 

The two Christian denominations look on with indifference at the profanation and
destruction of a noble and unique creature who was given to the world as a gift of
God's grace. For the future of the world, however, it does not matter which of the two
triumphs over the other, the Catholic or the Protestant. But it does matter whether
Aryan humanity survives or perishes. And yet the two Christian denominations are not
contending against the destroyer of Aryan humanity but are trying to destroy one
another. Everybody who has the right kind of feeling for his country is solemnly bound,
each within his own denomination, to see to it that he is not constantly talking about the
Will of God merely from the lips but that in actual fact he fulfils the Will of God and
does not allow God's handiwork to be debased. For it was by the Will of God that men
were made of a certain bodily shape, were given their natures and their faculties.
Whoever destroys His work wages war against God's Creation and God's Will.

Therefore everyone should endeavour, each in his own denomination of course, and
should consider it as his first and most solemn duty to hinder any and everyone whose
conduct tends, either by word or deed, to go outside his own religious body and pick a
quarrel with those of another denomination. For, in view of the religious schism that
exists in Germany, to attack the essential characteristics of one denomination must
necessarily lead to a war of extermination between the two Christian denominations.
Here there can be no comparison between our position and that of France, or Spain or
Italy. In those three countries one may, for instance, make propaganda for the side that
is fighting against ultramontanism without thereby incurring the danger of a national
rift among the French, or Spanish or Italian people. In Germany, however, that cannot
be so, for here the Protestants would also take part in such propaganda. And thus the
defence which elsewhere only Catholics organize against clerical aggression in political
matters would assume with us the character of a Protestant attack against Catholicism.
What may be tolerated by the faithful in one denomination even when it seems unjust
to them, will at once be indignantly rejected and opposed on A PRIORI grounds if it
should come from the militant leaders of another denomination. This is so true that
even men who would be ready and willing to fight for the removal of manifest
grievances within their own religious denomination will drop their own fight and turn
their activities against the outsider the moment the abolition of such grievances is
counselled or demanded by one who is not of the same faith. 

They consider it
unjustified and inadmissible and incorrect for outsiders to meddle in matters which do
not affect them at all. Such attempts are not excused even when they are inspired by a
feeling for the supreme interests of the national community; because even in our day
religious feelings still have deeper roots than all feeling for political and national
expediency. That cannot be changed by setting one denomination against another in
bitter conflict. It can be changed only if, through a spirit of mutual tolerance, the nation
can be assured of a future the greatness of which will gradually operate as a conciliating
factor in the sphere of religion also. I have no hesitation in saying that in those men who
seek to-day to embroil the patriotic movement in religious quarrels I see worse enemies
of my country than the international communists are. For the National Socialist 
Movement has set itself to the task of converting those communists. But anyone who
goes outside the ranks of his own Movement and tends to turn it away from the
fulfilment of its mission is acting in a manner that deserves the severest condemnation.
He is acting as a champion of Jewish interests, whether consciously or unconsciously
does not matter. For it is in the interests of the Jews to-day that the energies of the
patriotic movement should be squandered in a religious conflict, because it is beginning
to be dangerous for the Jews. I have purposely used the phrase about SQUANDERING
the energies of the Movement, because nobody but some person who is entirely
ignorant of history could imagine that this movement can solve a question which the
greatest statesmen have tried for centuries to solve, and tried in vain.

Anyhow the facts speak for themselves. The men who suddenly discovered, in 1924,
that the highest mission of the patriotic movement was to fight ultramontanism, have
not succeeded in smashing ultramontanism, but they succeeded in splitting the patriotic
movement. I have to guard against the possibility of some immature brain arising in the
patriotic movement which thinks that it can do what even a Bismarck failed to do. It
will be always one of the first duties of those who are directing the National Socialist
Movement to oppose unconditionally any attempt to place the National Socialist
Movement at the service of such a conflict. And anybody who conducts a propaganda
with that end in view must be expelled forthwith from its ranks.

As a matter of fact we succeeded until the autumn of 1923 in keeping our movement
away from such controversies. The most devoted Protestant could stand side by side
with the most devoted Catholic in our ranks without having his conscience disturbed in
the slightest as far as concerned his religious convictions. The bitter struggle which both
waged in common against the wrecker of Aryan humanity taught them natural respect
and esteem. And it was just in those years that our movement had to engage in a bitter
strife with the Centre Party not for religious ends but for national, racial, political and
economic ends. The success we then achieved showed that we were right, but it does
not speak to-day in favour of those who thought they knew better.

In recent years things have gone so far that patriotic circles, in god-forsaken blindness
of their religious strife, could not recognize the folly of their conduct even from the fact
that atheist Marxist newspapers advocated the cause of one religious denomination or
the other, according as it suited Marxist interests, so as to create confusion through
slogans and declarations which were often immeasurably stupid, now molesting the
one party and again the other, and thus poking the fire to keep the blaze at its highest.
But in the case of a people like the Germans, whose history has so often shown them
capable of fighting for phantoms to the point of complete exhaustion, every war-cry is a
mortal danger. By these slogans our people have often been drawn away from the real
problems of their existence. While we were exhausting our energies in religious wars
the others were acquiring their share of the world. And while the patriotic movement is 
debating with itself whether the ultramontane danger be greater than the Jewish, or vice
versa, the Jew is destroying the racial basis of our existence and thereby annihilating
our people. As far as regards that kind of 'patriotic' warrior, on behalf of the National
Socialist Movement and therefore of the German people I pray with all my heart: "Lord,
preserve us from such friends, and then we can easily deal with our enemies."
The controversy over federation and unification, so cunningly propagandized by the
Jews in 1919-1920 and onwards, forced National Socialism, which repudiated the
quarrel, to take up a definite stand in relation to the essential problem concerned in it.
Ought Germany to be a confederacy or a military State? What is the practical
significance of these terms? To me it seems that the second question is more important
than the first, because it is fundamental to the understanding of the whole problem and
also because the answer to it may help to clear up confusion and therewith have a
conciliating effect.
