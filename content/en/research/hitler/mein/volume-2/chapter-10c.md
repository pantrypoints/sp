 <!-- (Note 22) -->

A Confederacy is a union of sovereign states which of their own free will and in virtue of their sovereignty come together and create a collective unit, ceding to that unit as much of their own sovereign rights as will render the existence of the union possible and will guarantee it.

But the theoretical formula is not wholly put into practice by any confederacy that exists today.

And least of all by the American Union, where it is impossible to speak of original sovereignty in regard to the majority of the states. Many of them were not included in the federal complex until long after it had been established. 

The states that make up the American Union are mostly in the nature of territories, more or less,
formed for technical administrative purposes, their boundaries having in many cases
been fixed in the mapping office. Originally these states did not and could not possess
sovereign rights of their own. Because it was the Union that created most of the socalled states. Therefore the sovereign rights, often very comprehensive, which were left, or rather granted, to the various territories correspond not only to the whole character of the Confederation but also to its vast space, which is equivalent to the size of a
Continent. Consequently, in speaking of the United States of America one must not
consider them as sovereign states but as enjoying rights or, better perhaps, autarchic
powers, granted to them and guaranteed by the Constitution.

Nor does our definition adequately express the condition of affairs in Germany. It is
true that in Germany the individual states existed as states before the REICH and that
the REICH was formed from them. The REICH, however, was not formed by the
voluntary and equal co-operation of the individual states, but rather because the state of
Prussia gradually acquired a position of hegemony over the others. The difference in
the territorial area alone between the German states prevents any comparison with the 
American Union. The great difference in territorial area between the very small German
states that then existed and the larger, or even still more the largest, demonstrates the
inequality of their achievements and shows that they could not take an equal part in
founding and shaping the federal Empire. In the case of most of these individual states
it cannot be maintained that they ever enjoyed real sovereignty; and the term 'State
Sovereignty' was really nothing more than an administrative formula which had no
inner meaning. As a matter of fact, not only developments in the past but also in our
own time wiped out several of these so-called 'Sovereign States' and thus proved in the
most definite way how frail these 'sovereign' state formations were.
I cannot deal here with the historical question of how these individual states came to be
established, but I must call attention to the fact that hardly in any case did their frontiers
coincide with ethical frontiers of the inhabitants. They were purely political phenomena
which for the most part emerged during the sad epoch when the German Empire was in
a state of exhaustion and was dismembered. They represented both cause and effect in
the process of exhaustion and partition of our fatherland.

The Constitution of the old REICH took all this into account, at least up to a certain
degree, in so far as the individual states were not accorded equal representation in the
Reichstag, but a representation proportionate to their respective areas, their actual
importance and the role which they played in the formation of the REICH.
The sovereign rights which the individual states renounced in order to form the REICH
were voluntarily ceded only to a very small degree. For the most part they had no
practical existence or they were simply taken by Prussia under the pressure of her
preponderant power. The principle followed by Bismarck was not to give the REICH
what he could take from the individual states but to demand from the individual states
only what was absolutely necessary for the REICH. A moderate and wise policy. On the
one side Bismarck showed the greatest regard for customs and traditions; on the other
side his policy secured for the new REICH from its foundation onwards a great
measure of love and willing co-operation. But it would be a fundamental error to
attribute Bismarck's decision to any conviction on his part that the REICH was thus
acquiring all the rights of sovereignty which would suflice for all time. That was far
from Bismarck's idea. On the contrary, he wished to leave over for the future what it
would be difficult to carry through at the moment and might not have been readily
agreed to by the individual states. He trusted to the levelling effect of time and to the
pressure exercised by the process of evolution, the steady action of which appeared
more effective than an attempt to break the resistance which the individual states
offered at the moment. By this policy he showed his great ability in the art of
statesmanship. And, as a matter of fact, the sovereignty of the REICH has continually
increased at the cost of the sovereignty of the individual states. The passing of time has
achieved what Bismarck hoped it would. 

The German collapse and the abolition of the monarchical form of government
necessarily hastened this development. The German federal states, which had not been
grounded on ethnical foundations but arose rather out of political conditions, were
bound to lose their importance the moment the monarchical form of government and
the dynasties connected with it were abolished, for it was to the spirit inherent in these
that the individual states owned their political origin and development. Thus deprived
of their internal RAISON D'ÊTRE, they renounced all right to survival and were
induced by purely practical reasons to fuse with their neighbours or else they joined the
more powerful states out of their own free will. That proved in a striking manner how
extraordinarily frail was the actual sovereignty these small phantom states enjoyed, and
it proved too how lightly they were estimated by their own citizens.

Though the abolition of the monarchical regime and its representatives had dealt a hard
blow to the federal character of the REICH, still more destructive, from the federal point
of view, was the acceptance of the obligations that resulted from the 'peace' treaty.
It was only natural and logical that the federal states should lose all sovereign control
over the finances the moment the REICH, in consequence of a lost war, was subjected to
financial obligations which could never be guaranteed through separate treaties with
the individual states. The subsequent steps which led the REICH to take over the posts
and railways were an enforced advance in the process of enslaving our people, a
process which the peace treaties gradually developed. The REICH was forced to secure
possession of resources which had to be constantly increased in order to satisfy the
demands made by further extortions.

The form in which the powers of the REICH were thus extended to embrace the federal
states was often ridiculously stupid, but in itself the procedure was logical and natural.
The blame for it must be laid at the door of these men and those parties that failed in the
hour of need to concentrate all their energies in an effort to bring the war to a victorious
issue. The guilt lies on those parties which, especially in Bavaria, catered for their own
egotistic interests during the war and refused to the REICH what the REICH had to
requisition to a tenfold greater measure when the war was lost. The retribution of
History! Rarely has the vengeance of Heaven followed so closely on the crime as it did
in this case. Those same parties which, a few years previously, placed the interests of
their own states--especially in Bavaria--before those of the REICH had now to look on
passively while the pressure of events forced the REICH, in its own interests, to abolish
the existence of the individual states. They were the victims of their own defaults.
It was an unparalleled example of hypocrisy to raise the cry of lamentation over the loss
which the federal states suffered in being deprived of their sovereign rights. This cry
was raised before the electorate, for it is only to the electorate that our contemporary
parties address themselves. But these parties, without exception, outbid one another in
accepting a policy of fulfilment which, by the sheer force of circumstances and in its 
ultimate consequences, could not but lead to a profound alteration in the internal
structure of the REICH. Bismarck's REICH was free and unhampered by any
obligations towards the outside world.

Bismarck's REICH never had to shoulder such heavy and entirely unproductive obligations as those to which Germany was subjected under the Dawes Plan. Also in domestic affairs Bismarck's REICH was able to limit its powers to a few matters that were absolutely necessary for its existence. 

Therefore it could dispense with the necessity of a financial control over these states and could live from their contributions.
On the other side the relatively small financial tribute which the federal states had to
pay to the REICH induced them to welcome its existence. But it is untrue and unjust to
state now, as certain propagandists do, that the federal states are displeased with the
REICH merely because of their financial subjection to it. No, that is not how the matter
really stands. 

The lack of sympathy for the political idea embodied in the REICH is not due to the loss of sovereign rights on the part of the individual states. It is much more the result of the deplorable fashion in which the present régime cares for the interests of the German people. Despite all the celebrations in honour of the national flag and the Constitution, every section of the German people feels that the present REICH is not in
accordance with its heart's desire. 

The Law for the Protection of the Republic may prevent outrages against republican institutions, but it will not gain the love of one single German. In its constant anxiety to protect itself against its own citizens by means of laws and sentences of imprisonment, the Republic has aroused sharp and
humiliating criticism of all republican institutions as such.

For another reason also it is untrue to say, as certain parties affirm to-day, that the REICH has ceased to be popular on account of its overbearing conduct in regard to certain sovereign rights which the individual states had heretofore enjoyed. Supposing the REICH had not extended its authority over the individual states, there is no reason to believe that it would find more favour among those states if the general obligations
remained so heavy as they now are. 

On the contrary, if the individual states had to pay their respective shares of the highly increased tribute which the REICH has to meet today in order to fulfil the provisions of the Versailles Dictate, the hostility towards the REICH would be infinitely greater. For then not only would it prove difficult to collect the respective contributions due to the REICH from the federal states, but coercive methods would have to be employed in making the collections. The Republic stands on the footing of the peace treaties and has neither the courage nor the intention to break
them. 

That being so, it must observe the obligations which the peace treaties have imposed on it. The responsibility for this situation is to be attributed solely to those parties who preach unceasingly to the patient electoral masses on the necessity of maintaining the autonomy of the federal states, while at the same time they champion and demand of the REICH a policy which must necessarily lead to the suppression of
even the very last of those so-called 'sovereign' rights. 

I say NECESSARILY because the present REICH has no other possible means of bearing the burden of charges which an insane domestic and foreign policy has laid on it. Here still another wedge is placed on the former, to drive it in still deeper. Every new debt which the REICH contracts, through the criminal way in which the interests of Germany are represented VIS-À-VIS foreign countries, necessitates a new and stronger blow which drives the under wedges still deeper, That blow demands another step in the progressive abolition of the sovereign rights of the individual states, so as not to allow the germs of opposition to rise up into activity or even to exist.

The chief characteristic difference between the policy of the present REICH and that of former times lies in this: The old REICH gave freedom to its people at home and showed itself strong towards the outside world, whereas the Republic shows itself weak towards the stranger and oppresses its own citizens at home. In both cases one attitude determines the other. 

A vigorous national State does not need to make many laws for the interior, because of the affection and attachment of its citizens. The international servile State can live only by coercing its citizens to render it the services it demands. 

It is a piece of impudent falsehood for the present regime to speak of 'Free citizens'. Only the old Germany could speak in that manner. The present Republic is a colony of slaves at the service of the stranger. At best it has subjects, but not citizens. 

Hence it does not possess a national flag but only a trade mark, introduced and protected by official decree and legislative measures. This symbol, which is the Gessler's cap of German Democracy, will always remain alien to the spirit of our people. On its side, the Republic having no sense of tradition or respect for past greatness, dragged the symbol of the past in the mud, but it will be surprised one day to discover how
superficial is the devotion of its citizens to its own symbol. The Republic has given to
itself the character of an intermezzo in German history. And so this State is bound
constantly to restrict more and more the sovereign rights of the individual states, not
only for general reasons of a financial character but also on principle. For by enforcing a
policy of financial blackmail, to squeeze the last ounce of substance out of its people, it
is forced also to take their last rights away from them, lest the general discontent may
one day flame up into open rebellion.

We, National Socialists, would reverse this formula and would adopt the following axiom: A strong national REICH which recognizes and protects to the largest possible measure the rights of its citizens both within and outside its frontiers can allow freedom to reign at home without trembling for the safety of the State. 

On the other hand, a strong national Government can intervene to a considerable degree in the liberties of the individual subject as well as in the liberties of the constituent states without thereby weakening the ideal of the REICH; and it can do this while recognizing its responsibility for the ideal of the REICH, because in these particular acts and measures the individual citizen recognizes a means of promoting the prestige of the nation as a whole. 

Of course, every State in the world has to face the question of unification in its internal organization. And Germany is no exception in this matter. Nowadays it is absurd to speak of 'statal sovereignty' for the constituent states of the REICH, because that has already become impossible on account of the ridiculously small size of so many of these states. 

In the sphere of commerce as well as that of administration the importance of the individual states has been steadily decreasing. Modern means of communication and mechanical progress have been increasingly restricting distance and space. 

What was once a State is to-day only a province and the territory covered by a modern State had once the importance of a continent. The purely technical difficulty of administering a State like Germany is not greater than that of governing a province like Brandenburg a hundred years ago. And to-day it is easier to cover the distance from Munich to Berlin than it was to cover the distance from Munich to Starnberg a hundred years ago. 

In view of the modern means of transport, the whole territory of the REICH to-day is smaller than that of certain German federal states at the time of the Napoleonic wars. To close one's eyes to the consequences of these facts means to live in the past. There always were, there are and always will be, men who do this. They may retard but they cannot stop the revolutions of history.
