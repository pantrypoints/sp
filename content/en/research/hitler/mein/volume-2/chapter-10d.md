We, National Socialists, must not allow the consequences of that truth to pass by us
unnoticed. In these matters also we must not permit ourselves to be misled by the
phrases of our so-called national bourgeois parties. I say 'phrases', because these same
parodies do not seriously believe that it is possible for them to carry out their proposals,
and because they themselves are the chief culprits and also the accomplices responsible
for the present state of affairs. 

Especially in Bavaria, the demands for a halt in the process of centralization can be no more than a party move behind which there is no serious idea. If these parties ever had to pass from the realm of phrase-making into that of practical deeds they would present a sorry spectacle. Every so-called 'Robbery of

Sovereign Rights' from Bavaria by the REICH has met with no practical resistance, except for some fatuous barking by way of protest. 

When anyone seriously opposed the madness that was shown in carrying out this system of centralization he was told by those same parties that he understood nothing of the nature and needs of the State to-day. They slandered him and pronounced him anathema and persecuted him until he was either shut up in prison or illegally deprived of the right of public speech. 

In the light of these facts our followers should become all the more convinced of the profound hypocrisy which characterizes these so-called federalist circles. To a certain extent they use the federalist doctrine just as they use the name of religion, merely as a means of promoting their own base party interests.

A certain unification, especially in the field of transport, appears logical. But we, National Socialists, feel it our duty to oppose with all our might such a development in the modern State, especially when the measures proposed are solely for the purpose of screening a disastrous foreign policy and making it possible. 

Just because the present REICH has threatened to take over the railways, the posts, the finances, etc., not  from the high standpoint of a national policy, but in order to have in its hands the means and pledges for an unlimited policy of fulfilment--for that reason we, National Socialists, must take every step that seems suitable to obstruct and, if possible, definitely to prevent such a policy. We must fight against the present system of amalgamating institutions that are vitally important for the existence of our people, because this system is being adopted solely to facilitate the payment of milliards and the transference of pledges to the stranger, under the post-War provisions which our politicians have accepted.

For these reasons also the National Socialist Movement has to take up a stand against
such tendencies.

Moreover, we must oppose such centralization because in domestic affairs it helps to reinforce a system of government which in all its manifestations has brought the greatest misfortunes on the German nation. The present Jewish-Democratic REICH, which has become a veritable curse for the German people, is seeking to negative the force of the criticism offered by all the federal states which have not yet become imbued
with the spirit of the age, and is trying to carry out this policy by crushing them to the
point of annihilation. 

In face of this we National Socialists must try to ground the opposition of the individual states on such a basis that it will be able to operate with a good promise of success. We must do this by transforming the struggle against centralization into something that will be an expression of the higher interests of the
German nation as such. 

Therefore, while the Bavarian Populist Party, acting from its own narrow and particularist standpoint, fights to maintain the 'special rights' of the Bavarian State, we ought to stand on quite a different ground in fighting for the same rights. Our grounds ought to be those of the higher national interests in opposition to
the November Democracy.

A still further reason for opposing a centralizing process of that kind arises from the
certain conviction that in great part this so-called nationalization does not make for
unification at all and still less for simplification. In many cases it is adopted simply as a
means of removing from the sovereign control of the individual states certain
institutions which they wish to place in the hands of the revolutionary parties. 

In German History favouritism has never been of so base a character as in the democratic republic. A great portion of this centralization to-day is the work of parties which once promised that they would open the way for the promotion of talent, meaning thereby that they would fill those posts and offices entirely with their own partisans. 

Since the foundation of the Republic the Jews especially have been obtaining positions in the economic institutions taken over by the REICH and also positions in the national administration, so that the one and the other have become preserves of Jewry. 

For tactical reasons, this last consideration obliges us to watch with the greatest attention every further attempt at centralization and fight it at each step. But in doing this our standpoint must always be that of a lofty national policy and never a pettifogging particularism.

This last observation is necessary, lest an opinion might arise among our own followers
that we do not accredit to the REICH the right of incorporating in itself a sovereignty
which is superior to that of the constituent states. As regards this right we cannot and
must not entertain the slightest doubt. Because for us the State is nothing but a form. Its
substance, or content, is the essential thing. And that is the nation, the people. It is clear
therefore that every other interest must be subordinated to the supreme interests of the
nation. In particular we cannot accredit to any other state a sovereign power and
sovereign rights within the confines of the nation and the REICH, which represents the
nation. 

The absurdity which some federal states commit by maintaining 'representations' abroad and corresponding foreign 'representations' among themselves--that must cease and will cease. Until this happens we cannot be surprised if certain foreign countries are dubious about the political unity of the REICH and act
accordingly. The absurdity of these 'representations' is all the greater because they do
harm and do not bring the slightest advantage. 

If the interests of a German abroad cannot be protected by the ambassador of the REICH, much less can they be protected by the minister from some small federal state which appears ridiculous in the framework of the present world order. The real truth is that these small federal states are envisaged as points of attack for attempts at secession, which prospect is always pleasing to a certain foreign State. We, National Socialists, must not allow some noble caste which has become effete with age to occupy an ambassadorial post abroad, with
the idea that by engrafting one of its withered branches in new soil the green leaves
may sprout again. Already in the time of the old REICH our diplomatic representatives
abroad were such a sorry lot that a further trial of that experience would be out of the
question.

In the future the importance of the individual states will be transferred to the sphere of our cultural policy. The monarch who did most to make Bavaria an important centre was not an obstinate particularist with anti-German tendencies, but Ludwig I who was as much devoted to the ideal of German greatness as he was to that of art. 

His first consideration was to use the powers of the state to develop the cultural position of Bavaria and not its political power. And in doing this he produced better and more durable results than if he had followed any other line of conduct. 

Up to this time, Munich was a provincial residence town of only small importance, but he
transformed it into the metropolis of German art and by doing so he made it an
intellectual centre which even to-day holds Franconia to Bavaria, though the
Franconians are of quite a different temperament. If Munich had remained as it had
been earlier, what has happened in Saxony would have been repeated in Bavaria, with
the difference that Leipzig and Bavarian Nürnberg would have become, not Bavarian
but Franconian cities. It was not the cry of "Down with Prussia" that made Munich
great. What made this a city of importance was the King who wished to present it to the 
German nation as an artistic jewel that would have to be seen and appreciated, and so it
has turned out in fact. Therein lies a lesson for the future. The importance of the
individual states in the future will no longer lie in their political or statal power. I look
to them rather as important ethnical and cultural centres. But even in this respect time
will do its levelling work. Modern travelling facilities shuffle people among one another
in such a way that tribal boundaries will fade out and even the cultural picture will
gradually become more of a uniform pattern.

The army must definitely be kept clear of the influence of the individual states. The
coming National Socialist State must not fall back into the error of the past by imposing
on the army a task which is not within its sphere and never should have been assigned
to it. The German army does not exist for the purpose of being a school in which tribal
particularisms are to be cultivated and preserved, but rather as a school for teaching all
the Germans to understand and adapt their habits to one another. Whatever tends to
have a separating influence in the life of the nation ought to be made a unifying
influence in the army. The army must raise the German boy above the narrow horizon
of his own little native province and set him within the broad picture of the nation. The
youth must learn to know, not the confines of his own region but those of the
fatherland, because it is the latter that he will have to defend one day. It is therefore
absurd to have the German youth do his military training in his own native region.
During that period he ought to learn to know Germany. This is all the more important
to-day, since young Germans no longer travel on their own account as they once used
to do and thus enlarge their horizon. In view of this, is it not absurd to leave the young
Bavarian recruit at Munich, the recruit from Baden at Baden itself and the
Württemberger at Stuttgart and so on? And would it not be more reasonable to show
the Rhine and the North Sea to the Bavarian, the Alps to the native of Hamburg and the
mountains of Central Germany to the boy from East Prussia? The character proper to
each region ought to be maintained in the troops but not in the training garrisons. We
may disapprove of every attempt at unification but not that of unifying the army. On
the contrary, even though we should wish to welcome no other kind of unification, this
must be greeted with joy. In view of the size of the present army of the REICH, it would
be absurd to maintain the federal divisions among the troops. Moreover, in the
unification of the German army which has actually been effected we see a fact which we
must not renounce but restore in the future national army.

Finally a new and triumphant idea should burst every chain which tends to paralyse its
efforts to push forward. National Socialism must claim the right to impose its principles
on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of
federal states. And we must educate the German nation in our ideas and principles. As
the Churches do not feel themselves bound or limited by political confines, so the
National Socialist Idea cannot feel itself limited to the territories of the individual
federal states that belong to our Fatherland. 

The National Socialist doctrine is not handmaid to the political interests of the single federal states. 

<!-- One day it must become teacher to the whole German nation.  -->

It must determine the life of the whole people and shape that life anew. For this reason we must imperatively demand the right to overstep boundaries that have been traced by a political development which we repudiate.

The more completely our ideas triumph, the more liberty can we concede in particular
affairs to our citizens at home.
