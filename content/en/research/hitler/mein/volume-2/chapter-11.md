THE YEAR 1921 was especially important for me from many points of view.

When I entered the German Labour Party I at once took charge of the propaganda, believing this branch to be far the most important for the time being. Just then it was not a matter of pressing necessity to cudgel one's brains over problems of organization.

The first necessity was to spread our ideas among as many people as possible.

Propaganda should go well ahead of organization and gather together the human material for the latter to work up. I have never been in favour of hasty and pedantic methods of organization, because in most cases the result is merely a piece of dead mechanism and only rarely a living organization. 

Organization is a thing that derives its existence from organic life, organic evolution. When the same set of ideas have found a lodgement in the minds of a certain number of people they tend of themselves to form a
certain degree of order among those people and out of this inner formation something
that is very valuable arises. 

Of course here, as everywhere else, one must take account of those human weaknesses which make men hesitate, especially at the beginning, to submit to the control of a superior mind. 

If an organization is imposed from above
downwards in a mechanical fashion, there is always the danger that some individual may push himself forward who is not known for what he is and who, out of jealousy, will try to hinder abler persons from taking a leading place in the movement. The damage that results from that kind of thing may have fatal consequences, especially in a
new movement.

For this reason it is advisable first to propagate and publicly expound the ideas on which the movement is founded. This work of propaganda should continue for a certain time and should be directed from one centre. When the ideas have gradually
won over a number of people this human material should be carefully sifted for the
purpose of selecting those who have ability in leadership and putting that ability to the
test. It will often be found that apparently insignificant persons will nevertheless turn
out to be born leaders.

Of course, it is quite a mistake to suppose that those who show a very intelligent grasp
of the theory underlying a movement are for that reason qualified to fill responsible
positions on the directorate. The contrary is very frequently the case.

Great masters of theory are only very rarely great organizers also. And this is because the greatness of the theorist and founder of a system consists in being able to discover and lay down those laws that are right in the abstract, whereas the organizer must first of all be a man of psychological insight. He must take men as they are, and for that
reason he must know them, not having too high or too low an estimate of human
nature. 

He must take account of their weaknesses, their baseness and all the other
various characteristics, so as to form something out of them which will be a living
organism, endowed with strong powers of resistance, fitted to be the carrier of an idea
and strong enough to ensure the triumph of that idea.

But it is still more rare to find a great theorist who is at the same time a great leader. For
the latter must be more of an agitator, a truth that will not be readily accepted by many
of those who deal with problems only from the scientific standpoint. And yet what I say
is only natural. For an agitator who shows himself capable of expounding ideas to the
great masses must always be a psychologist, even though he may be only a demagogue.
Therefore he will always be a much more capable leader than the contemplative theorist
who meditates on his ideas, far from the human throng and the world. For to be a
leader means to be able to move the masses. The gift of formulating ideas has nothing
whatsoever to do with the capacity for leadership. It would be entirely futile to discuss
the question as to which is the more important: the faculty of conceiving ideals and
human aims or that of being able to have them put into practice. Here, as so often
happens in life, the one would be entirely meaningless without the other. The noblest
conceptions of the human understanding remain without purpose or value if the leader
cannot move the masses towards them. And, conversely, what would it avail to have all
the genius and elan of a leader if the intellectual theorist does not fix the aims for which
mankind must struggle. But when the abilities of theorist and organizer and leader are
united in the one person, then we have the rarest phenomenon on this earth. And it is
that union which produces the great man.

As I have already said, during my first period in the Party I devoted myself to the work
of propaganda. I had to succeed in gradually gathering together a small nucleus of men
who would accept the new teaching and be inspired by it. And in this way we should
provide the human material which subsequently would form the constituent elements
of the organization. Thus the goal of the propagandist is nearly always fixed far beyond
that of the organizer.

If a movement proposes to overthrow a certain order of things and construct a new one
in its place, then the following principles must be clearly understood and must
dominate in the ranks of its leadership: Every movement which has gained its human
material must first divide this material into two groups: namely, followers and
members. 

It is the task of the propagandist to recruit the followers and it is the task of the
organizer to select the members.

The follower of a movement is he who understands and accepts its aims; the member is
he who fights for them.

The follower is one whom the propaganda has converted to the doctrine of the
movement. The member is he who will be charged by the organization to collaborate in
winning over new followers from which in turn new members can be formed.
To be a follower needs only the passive recognition of the idea. To be a member means
to represent that idea and fight for it. From ten followers one can have scarcely more
than two members. To be a follower simply implies that a man has accepted the
teaching of the movement; whereas to be a member means that a man has the courage
to participate actively in diffusing that teaching in which he has come to believe.
Because of its passive character, the simple effort of believing in a political doctrine is
enough for the majority, for the majority of mankind is mentally lazy and timid. To be a
member one must be intellectually active, and therefore this applies only to the
minority.

Such being the case, the propagandist must seek untiringly to acquire new followers for
the movement, whereas the organizer must diligently look out for the best elements
among such followers, so that these elements may be transformed into members. The
propagandist need not trouble too much about the personal worth of the individual
proselytes he has won for the movement. He need not inquire into their abilities, their
intelligence or character. From these proselytes, however, the organizer will have to
select those individuals who are most capable of actively helping to bring the
movement to victory.

The propagandist aims at inducing the whole people to accept his teaching. The
organizer includes in his body of membership only those who, on psychological
grounds, will not be an impediment to the further diffusion of the doctrines of the
movement.

The propagandist inculcates his doctrine among the masses, with the idea of preparing
them for the time when this doctrine will triumph, through the body of combatant
members which he has formed from those followers who have given proof of the
necessary ability and will-power to carry the struggle to victory.

The final triumph of a doctrine will be made all the more easy if the propagandist has
effectively converted large bodies of men to the belief in that doctrine and if the
organization that actively conducts the fight be exclusive, vigorous and solid. 
When the propaganda work has converted a whole people to believe in a doctrine, the
organization can turn the results of this into practical effect through the work of a mere
handful of men. Propaganda and organization, therefore follower and member, then
stand towards one another in a definite mutual relationship. The better the propaganda
has worked, the smaller will the organization be. The greater the number of followers,
so much the smaller can be the number of members. And conversely. If the propaganda
be bad, the organization must be large. And if there be only a small number of
followers, the membership must be all the larger--if the movement really counts on
being successful.

The first duty of the propagandist is to win over people who can subsequently be taken
into the organization. And the first duty of the organization is to select and train men
who will be capable of carrying on the propaganda. The second duty of the
organization is to disrupt the existing order of things and thus make room for the
penetration of the new teaching which it represents, while the duty of the organizer
must be to fight for the purpose of securing power, so that the doctrine may finally
triumph.

A revolutionary conception of the world and human existence will always achieve
decisive success when the new WELTANSCHAUUNG has been taught to a whole
people, or subsequently forced upon them if necessary, and when, on the other hand,
the central organization, the movement itself, is in the hands of only those few men who
are absolutely indispensable to form the nerve-centres of the coming State.
Put in another way, this means that in every great revolutionary movement that is of
world importance the idea of this movement must always be spread abroad through the
operation of propaganda. The propagandist must never tire in his efforts to make the
new ideas clearly understood, inculcating them among others, or at least he must place
himself in the position of those others and endeavour to upset their confidence in the
convictions they have hitherto held. In order that such propaganda should have
backbone to it, it must be based on an organization. The organization chooses its
members from among those followers whom the propaganda has won. That
organization will become all the more vigorous if the work of propaganda be pushed
forward intensively. And the propaganda will work all the better when the
organization back of it is vigorous and strong in itself.

Hence the supreme task of the organizer is to see to it that any discord or differences
which may arise among the members of the movement will not lead to a split and
thereby cramp the work within the movement. Moreover, it is the duty of the
organization to see that the fighting spirit of the movement does not flag or die out but
that it is constantly reinvigorated and restrengthened. It is not necessary the number of
members should increase indefinitely. Quite the contrary would be better. In view of 
the fact that only a fraction of humanity has energy and courage, a movement which
increases its own organization indefinitely must of necessity one day become plethoric
and inactive. Organizations, that is to say, groups of members, which increase their size
beyond certain dimensions gradually lose their fighting force and are no longer in form
to back up the propagation of a doctrine with aggressive elan and determination.
Now the greater and more revolutionary a doctrine is, so much the more active will be
the spirit inspiring its body of members, because the subversive energy of such a
doctrine will frighten way the chicken-hearted and small-minded bourgeoisie. In their
hearts they may believe in the doctrine but they are afraid to acknowledge their belief
openly. By reason of this very fact, however, an organization inspired by a veritable
revolutionary idea will attract into the body of its membership only the most active of
those believers who have been won for it by its propaganda. It is in this activity on the
part of the membership body, guaranteed by the process of natural selection, that we
are to seek the prerequisite conditions for the continuation of an active and spirited
propaganda and also the victorious struggle for the success of the idea on which the
movement is based.
