The greatest danger that can threaten a movement is an abnormal increase in the
number of its members, owing to its too rapid success. So long as a movement has to
carry on a hard and bitter fight, people of weak and fundamentally egotistic
temperament will steer very clear of it; but these will try to be accepted as members the
moment the party achieves a manifest success in the course of its development.

It is on these grounds that we are to explain why so many movements which were at
first successful slowed down before reaching the fulfilment of their purpose and, from
an inner weakness which could not otherwise be explained, gave up the struggle and
finally disappeared from the field. As a result of the early successes achieved, so many
undesirable, unworthy and especially timid individuals became members of the movement that they finally secured the majority and stifled the fighting spirit of the others. These inferior elements then turned the movement to the service of their personal interests and, debasing it to the level of their own miserable heroism, no longer
struggled for the triumph of the original idea. The fire of the first fervour died out, the
fighting spirit flagged and, as the bourgeois world is accustomed to say very justly in
such cases, the party mixed water with its wine.

For this reason it is necessary that a movement should, from the sheer instinct of selfpreservation, close its lists to new membership the moment it becomes successful. And any further increase in its organization should be allowed to take place only with the
most careful foresight and after a painstaking sifting of those who apply for
membership. Only thus will it be possible to keep the kernel of the movement intact
and fresh and sound. Care must be taken that the conduct of the movement is
maintained exclusively in the hands of this original nucleus. This means that the 
nucleus must direct the propaganda which aims at securing general recognition for the
movement. And the movement itself, when it has secured power in its hands, must
carry out all those acts and measures which are necessary in order that its ideas should
be finally established in practice.

With those elements that originally made the movement, the organization should
occupy all the important positions that have been conquered and from those elements
the whole directorate should be formed. This should continue until the maxims and
doctrines of the party have become the foundation and policy of the new State. Only
then will it be permissible gradually to give the reins into the hands of the Constitution
of that State which the spirit of the movement has created. But this usually happens
through a process of mutual rivalry, for here it is less a question of human intelligence
than of the play and effect of the forces whose development may indeed be foreseen
from the start but not perpetually controlled.
All great movements, whether of a political or religious nature, owe their imposing
success to the recognition and adoption of those principles. And no durable success is
conceivable if these laws are not observed.

As director of propaganda for the party, I took care not merely to prepare the ground
for the greatness of the movement in its subsequent stages, but I also adopted the most
radical measures against allowing into the organization any other than the best
material. For the more radical and exciting my propaganda was, the more did it
frighten weak and wavering characters away, thus preventing them from entering the
first nucleus of our organization. Perhaps they remained followers, but they did not
raise their voices. On the contrary, they maintained a discreet silence on the fact. Many
thousands of persons then assured me that they were in full agreement with us but they
could not on any account become members of our party. They said that the movement
was so radical that to take part in it as members would expose them to grave censures
and grave dangers, so that they would rather continue to be looked upon as honest and
peaceful citizens and remain aside, for the time being at least, though devoted to our
cause with all their hearts.

And that was all to the good. If all these men who in their hearts did not approve of
revolutionary ideas came into our movement as members at that time, we should be
looked upon as a pious confraternity to-day and not as a young movement inspired
with the spirit of combat.

The lively and combative form which I gave to all our propaganda fortified and
guaranteed the radical tendency of our movement, and the result was that, with a few
exceptions, only men of radical views were disposed to become members. 
It was due to the effect of our propaganda that within a short period of time hundreds
of thousands of citizens became convinced in their hearts that we were right and
wished us victory, although personally they were too timid to make sacrifices for our
cause or even participate in it.

Up to the middle of 1921 this simple activity of gathering in followers was sufficient
and was of value to the movement. But in the summer of that year certain events
happened which made it seem opportune for us to bring our organization into line with
the manifest successes which the propaganda had achieved.
An attempt made by a group of patriotic visionaries, supported by the chairman of the
party at that time, to take over the direction of the party led to the break up of this little
intrigue and, by a unanimous vote at a general meeting, entrusted the entire direction of
the party to my own hands. At the same time a new statute was passed which invested
sole responsibility in the chairman of the movement, abolished the system of
resolutions in committee and in its stead introduced the principle of division of labour
which since that time has worked excellently.

From August 1st, 1921, onwards I undertook this internal reorganization of the party
and was supported by a number of excellent men. I shall mention them and their work
individually later on.

In my endeavour to turn the results gained by the propaganda to the advantage of the
organization and thus stabilize them, I had to abolish completely a number of old
customs and introduce regulations which none of the other parties possessed or had
adopted.

In the years 1920-21 the movement was controlled by a committee elected by the
members at a general meeting. The committee was composed of a first and second
treasurer, a first and second secretary, and a first and second chairman at the head of it.
In addition to these there was a representative of the members, the director of
propaganda, and various assessors.

Comically enough, the committee embodied the very principle against which the
movement itself wanted to fight with all its energy, namely, the principle of
parliamentarianism. Here was a principle which personified everything that was being
opposed by the movement, from the smallest local groups to the district and regional
groups, the state groups and finally the national directorate itself. It was a system under
which we all suffered and are still suffering.

It was imperative to change this state of affairs forthwith, if this bad foundation in the
internal organization was not to keep the movement insecure and render the fulfilment
of its high mission impossible. 

The sessions of the committee, which were ruled by a protocol, and in which decisions
were made according to the vote of the majority, presented the picture of a miniature
parliament. Here also there was no such thing as personal responsibility. And here
reigned the same absurdities and illogical state of affairs as flourish in our great
representative bodies of the State. Names were presented to this committee for election
as secretaries, treasurers, representatives of the members of the organization,
propaganda agents and God knows what else. And then they all acted in common on
every particular question and decided it by vote. Accordingly, the director of
propaganda voted on a question that concerned the man who had to do with the
finances and the latter in his turn voted on a question that concerned only the
organization as such, the organizer voting on a subject that had to do with the
secretarial department, and so on.

Why select a special man for propaganda if treasurers and scribes and commissaries,
etc., had to deliver judgment on questions concerning it? To a person of commonsense
that sort of thing seemed as incomprehensible as it would be if in a great manufacturing
concern the board of directors were to decide on technical questions of production or if,
inversely, the engineers were to decide on questions of administration.
I refused to countenance that kind of folly and after a short time I ceased to appear at
the meetings of the committee. I did nothing else except attend to my own department
of propaganda and I did not permit any of the others to poke their heads into my
activities. Conversely, I did not interfere in the affairs of others.
When the new statute was approved and I was appointed as president, I had the
necessary authority in my hands and also the corresponding right to make short shrift
of all that nonsense. In the place of decisions by the majority vote of the committee, the
principle of absolute responsibility was introduced.

The chairman is responsible for the whole control of the movement. He apportions the
work among the members of the committee subordinate to him and for special work he
selects other individuals. Each of these gentlemen must bear sole responsibility for the
task assigned to him. He is subordinate only to the chairman, whose duty is to
supervise the general collaboration, selecting the personnel and giving general
directions for the co-ordination of the common work.

This principle of absolute responsibility is being adopted little by little throughout the
movement. In the small local groups and perhaps also in the regional and district
groups it will take yet a long time before the principle can be thoroughly imposed,
because timid and hesitant characters are naturally opposed to it. For them the idea of
bearing absolute responsibility for an act opens up an unpleasant prospect. They would
like to hide behind the shoulders of the majority in the so-called committee, having 
their acts covered by decisions passed in that way. But it seems to me a matter of
absolute necessity to take a decisive stand against that view, to make no concessions
whatsoever to this fear of responsibility, even though it takes some time before we can
put fully into effect this concept of duty and ability in leadership, which will finally
bring forward leaders who have the requisite abilities to occupy the chief posts.
In any case, a movement which must fight against the absurdity of parliamentary
institutions must be immune from this sort of thing. Only thus will it have the requisite
strength to carry on the struggle.

At a time when the majority dominates everywhere else a movement which is based on
the principle of one leader who has to bear personal responsibility for the direction of
the official acts of the movement itself will one day overthrow the present situation and
triumph over the existing regime. That is a mathematical certainty.
This idea made it necessary to reorganize our movement internally. The logical
development of this reorganization brought about a clear-cut distinction between the
economic section of the movement and the general political direction. The principle of
personal responsibility was extended to all the administrative branches of the party and
it brought about a healthy renovation, by liberating them from political influences and
allowing them to operate solely on economic principles.
