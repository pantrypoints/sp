In the autumn of 1921, when the party was founded, there were only six members. The
party did not have any headquarters, nor officials, nor formularies, nor a stamp, nor
printed material of any sort. The committee first held its sittings in a restaurant on the
Herrengasse and then in a café at Gasteig. This state of affairs could not last. So I at once
took action in the matter. I went around to several restaurants and hotels in Munich,
with the idea of renting a room in one of them for the use of the Party. In the old
Sterneckerbräu im Tal, there was a small room with arched roof, which in earlier times
was used as a sort of festive tavern where the Bavarian Counsellors of the Holy Roman
Empire foregathered. It was dark and dismal and accordingly well suited to its ancient
uses, though less suited to the new purpose it was now destined to serve. The little
street on which its one window looked out was so narrow that even on the brightest
summer day the room remained dim and sombre. Here we took up our first fixed
abode. The rent came to fifty marks per month, which was then an enormous sum for
us. But our exigencies had to be very modest. We dared not complain even when they
removed the wooden wainscoting a few days after we had taken possession. This
panelling had been specially put up for the Imperial Counsellors. The place began to
look more like a grotto than an office.

Still it marked an important step forward. Slowly we had electric light installed and
later on a telephone. A table and some borrowed chairs were brought, an open paper-
stand and later on a cupboard. Two sideboards, which belonged to the landlord, served
to store our leaflets, placards, etc.

As time went on it turned out impossible to direct the course of the movement merely
by holding a committee meeting once a week. The current business administration of
the movement could not be regularly attended to except we had a salaried official.
But that was then very difficult for us. The movement had still so few members that it
was hard to find among them a suitable person for the job who would be content with
very little for himself and at the same time would be ready to meet the manifold
demands which the movement would make on his time and energy.
After long searching we discovered a soldier who consented to become our first
administrator. His name was Schüssler, an old war comrade of mine. At first he came to
our new office every day between six and eight o'clock in the evening. Later on he came
from five to eight and subsequently for the whole afternoon. Finally it became a fulltime job and he worked in the office from morning until late at night. 

He was an industrious, upright and thoroughly honest man, faithful and devoted to the movement. He brought with him a small Adler typewriter of his own. It was the first machine to be used in the service of the party. Subsequently the party bought it by paying for it in installments. We needed a small safe in order to keep our papers and
register of membership from danger of being stolen--not to guard our funds, which did
not then exist. On the contrary, our financial position was so miserable that I often had
to dip my hand into my own personal savings.
After eighteen months our business quarters had become too small, so we moved to a
new place in the Cornelius Strasse. Again our office was in a restaurant, but instead of
one room we now had three smaller rooms and one large room with great windows. At
that time this appeared a wonderful thing to us. We remained there until the end of
November 1923.

In December 1920, we acquired the VÖLKISCHER BEOBACHTER. This newspaper
which, as its name implies, championed the claims of the people, was now to become
the organ of the German National Socialist Labour Party. At first it appeared twice
weekly; but at the beginning of 1928 it became a daily paper, and at the end of August
in the same year it began to appear in the large format which is now well known.
As a complete novice in journalism I then learned many a lesson for which I had to pay
dearly.

In contradistinction to the enormous number of papers in Jewish hands, there was at
that time only one important newspaper that defended the cause of the people. This
was a matter for grave consideration. As I have often learned by experience, the reason 
for that state of things must be attributed to the incompetent way in which the business
side of the so-called popular newspapers was managed. These were conducted too
much according to the rule that opinion should prevail over action that produces
results. Quite a wrong standpoint, for opinion is of itself something internal and finds
its best expression in productive activity. The man who does valuable work for his
people expresses thereby his excellent sentiments, whereas another who merely talks
about his opinions and does nothing that is of real value or use to the people is a person
who perverts all right thinking. And that attitude of his is also pernicious for the
community.

The VÖLKISCHE BEOBACHTER was a so-called 'popular' organ, as its name indicated.
It had all the good qualities, but still more the errors and weaknesses, inherent in all
popular institutions. Though its contents were excellent, its management as a business
concern was simply impossible. Here also the underlying idea was that popular
newspapers ought to be subsidized by popular contributions, without recognizing that
it had to make its way in competition with the others and that it was dishonest to expect
the subscriptions of good patriots to make up for the mistaken management of the
undertaking.

I took care to alter those conditions promptly, for I recognized the danger lurking in
them. Luck was on my side here, inasmuch as it brought me the man who since that
time has rendered innumerable services to the movement, not only as business manager
of the newspaper but also as business manager of the party. In 1914, in the War, I made
the acquaintance of Max Amann, who was then my superior and is to-day general
business Director of the Party. During four years in the War I had occasion to observe
almost continually the unusual ability, the diligence and the rigorous conscientiousness
of my future collaborator.

In the summer of 1921 I applied to my old regimental comrade, whom I met one day by
chance, and asked him to become business manager of the movement. At that time the
movement was passing through a grave crisis and I had reason to be dissatisfied with
several of our officials, with one of whom I had had a very bitter experience. Amann
then held a good situation in which there were also good prospects for him.
After long hesitation he agreed to my request, but only on condition that he must not be
at the mercy of incompetent committees. He must be responsible to one master, and
only one.
It is to the inestimable credit of this first business manager of the party, whose
commercial knowledge is extensive and profound, that he brought order and probity
into the various offices of the party. Since that time these have remained exemplary and
cannot be equalled or excelled in this by any other branches of the movement. But, as 
often happens in life, great ability provokes envy and disfavour. That had also to be
expected in this case and borne patiently.

Since 1922 rigorous regulations have been in force, not only for the commercial
construction of the movement but also in the organization of it as such. There exists
now a central filing system, where the names and particulars of all the members are
enrolled. The financing of the party has been placed on sound lines. The current
expenditure must be covered by the current receipts and special receipts can be used
only for special expenditures. Thus, notwithstanding the difficulties of the time the
movement remained practically without any debts, except for a few small current
accounts. Indeed, there was a permanent increase in the funds. Things are managed as
in a private business. The employed personnel hold their jobs in virtue of their practical
efficiency and could not in any manner take cover behind their professed loyalty to the
party. A good National Socialist proves his soundness by the readiness, diligence and
capability with which he discharges whatever duties are assigned to him in whatever
situation he holds within the national community. The man who does not fulfil his duty
in the job he holds cannot boast of a loyalty against which he himself really sins.
Adamant against all kinds of outer influence, the new business director of the party
firmly maintained the standpoint that there were no sinecure posts in the party
administration for followers and members of the movement whose pleasure is not
work. A movement which fights so energetically against the corruption introduced into
our civil service by the various political parties must be immune from that vice in its
own administrative department. It happened that some men were taken on the staff of
the paper who had formerly been adherents of the Bavarian People's Party, but their
work showed that they were excellently qualified for the job. The result of this
experiment was generally excellent. It was owing to this honest and frank recognition of
individual efficiency that the movement won the hearts of its employees more swiftly
and more profoundly than had ever been the case before. Subsequently they became
good National Socialists and remained so. Not in word only, but they proved it by the
steady and honest and conscientious work which they performed in the service of the
new movement. Naturally a well qualified party member was preferred to another who
had equal qualifications but did not belong to the party. The rigid determination with
which our new business chief applied these principles and gradually put them into
force, despite all misunderstandings, turned out to be of great advantage to the
movement. To this we owe the fact that it was possible for us--during the difficult
period of the inflation, when thousands of businesses failed and thousands of
newspapers had to cease publication--not only to keep the commercial department of
the movement going and meet all its obligations but also to make steady progress with
the VÖLKISCHE BEOBACHTER. At that time it came to be ranked among the great
newspapers. 

The year 1921 was of further importance for me by reason of the fact that in my position
as chairman of the party I slowly but steadily succeeded in putting a stop to the
criticisms and the intrusions of some members of the committee in regard to the
detailed activities of the party administration. This was important, because we could
not get a capable man to take on a job if nincompoops were constantly allowed to butt
in, pretending that they knew everything much better; whereas in reality they had left
only general chaos behind them. Then these wise-acres retired, for the most part quite
modestly, to seek another field for their activities where they could supervise and tell
how things ought to be done. Some men seemed to have a mania for sniffing behind
everything and were, so to say, always in a permanent state of pregnancy with
magnificent plans and ideas and projects and methods. Naturally their noble aim and
ideal were always the formation of a committee which could pretend to be an organ of
control in order to be able to sniff as experts into the regular work done by others. But it
is offensive and contrary to the spirit of National Socialism when incompetent people
constantly interfere in the work of capable persons. But these makers of committees do
not take that very much into account. In those years I felt it my duty to safeguard
against such annoyance all those who were entrusted with regular and responsible
work, so that there should be no spying over the shoulder and they would be
guaranteed a free hand in their day's work.

The best means of making committees innocuous, which either did nothing or cooked
up impracticable decisions, was to give them some real work to do. It was then amusing
to see how the members would silently fade away and were soon nowhere to be found.
It made me think of that great institution of the same kind, the Reichstag. How quickly
they would evanesce if they were put to some real work instead of talking, especially if
each member were made personally responsible for the work assigned to him.
I always demanded that, just as in private life so also in the movement, one should not
tire of seeking until the best and honestest and manifestly the most competent person
could be found for the position of leader or administrator in each section of the
movement. Once installed in his position he was given absolute authority and full
freedom of action towards his subordinates and full responsibility towards his
superiors. Nobody was placed in a position of authority towards his subordinates
unless he himself was competent in the work entrusted to them. In the course of two
years I brought my views more and more into practice; so that to-day, at least as far as
the higher direction of the movement is concerned, they are accepted as a matter of
course.
The manifest success of this attitude was shown on November 9th, 1923. Four years
previously, when I entered the movement, it did not have even a rubber stamp. On
November 9th, 1923, the party was dissolved and its property confiscated. The total
sum realized by all the objects of value and the paper amounted to more than 170,000
gold marks.
