OWING TO the rapid growth of the movement, in 1922 we felt compelled to take a definite stand on a question which has not been fully solved even yet.

In our efforts to discover the quickest and easiest way for the movement to reach the heart of the broad masses we were always confronted with the objection that the worker could never completely belong to us while his interests in the purely vocational and economic sphere were cared for by a political organization conducted by men whose
principles were quite different from ours.

That was quite a serious objection. The general belief was that a workman engaged in some trade or other could not exist if he did not belong to a trade union. Not only were his professional interests thus protected but a guarantee of permanent employment was simply inconceivable without membership in a trade union. The majority of the
workers were in the trades unions. 

Generally speaking, the unions had successfully conducted the battle for the establishment of a definite scale of wages and had concluded agreements which guaranteed the worker a steady income. 

Undoubtedly the workers in the various trades benefited by the results of that campaign and, for honest men especially, conflicts of conscience must have arisen if they took the wages which had been assured through the struggle fought by the trades unions and if at the same time the men themselves withdrew from the fight.

It was difficult to discuss this problem with the average bourgeois employer. 

He had no understanding (or did not wish to have any) for either the material or moral side of the
question. 

Finally he declared that his own economic interests were in principle opposed to every kind of organization which joined together the workmen that were dependent on him. Hence it was for the most part impossible to bring these bourgeois employers to take an impartial view of the situation. 

Here, therefore, as in so many other cases, it was necessary to appeal to disinterested outsiders who would not be subject to the temptation of fixing their attention on the trees and failing to see the forest. With a little good will on their part, they could much more easily understand a state of affairs which is of the highest importance for our present and future existence. 

In the first volume of this book I have already expressed my views on the nature and
purpose and necessity of trade unions. There I took up the standpoint that unless
measures are undertaken by the State (usually futile in such cases) or a new ideal is
introduced in our education, which would change the attitude of the employer towards
the worker, no other course would be open to the latter except to defend his own
interests himself by appealing to his equal rights as a contracting party within the
economic sphere of the nation's existence. I stated further that this would conform to
the interests of the national community if thereby social injustices could be redressed
which otherwise would cause serious damage to the whole social structure. I stated,
moreover, that the worker would always find it necessary to undertake this protective
action as long as there were men among the employers who had no sense of their social
obligations nor even of the most elementary human rights. And I concluded by saying
that if such self-defence be considered necessary its form ought to be that of an
association made up of the workers themselves on the basis of trades unions.
This was my general idea and it remained the same in 1922. But a clear and precise
formula was still to be discovered. We could not be satisfied with merely understanding
the problem. It was necessary to come to some conclusions that could be put into
practice. The following questions had to be answered:

(1) Are trade unions necessary?
(2) Should the German National Socialist Labour Party itself operate on a trade unionist
basis or have its members take part in trade unionist activities in some form or other?
(3) What form should a National Socialist Trades Union take? What are the tasks
confronting us and the ends we must try to attain?
(4) How can we establish trade unions for such tasks and aims?

I think that I have already answered the first question adequately. In the present state of
affairs I am convinced that we cannot possibly dispense with the trades unions. On the
contrary, they are among the most important institutions in the economic life of the
nation. Not only are they important in the sphere of social policy but also, and even
more so, in the national political sphere. For when the great masses of a nation see their
vital needs satisfied through a just trade unionist movement the stamina of the whole
nation in its struggle for existence will be enormously reinforced thereby.
Before everything else, the trades unions are necessary as building stones for the future
economic parliament, which will be made up of chambers representing the various
professions and occupations. 

The second question is also easy to answer. If the trade unionist movement is
important, then it is clear that National Socialism ought to take a definite stand on that
question, not only theoretically but also in practice. But how? That is more difficult to
see clearly.

The National Socialist Movement, which aims at establishing the National Socialist
People's State, must always bear steadfastly in mind the principle that every future
institution under that State must be rooted in the movement itself. It is a great mistake
to believe that by acquiring possession of supreme political power we can bring about a
definite reorganization, suddenly starting from nothing, without the help of a certain
reserve stock of men who have been trained beforehand, especially in the spirit of the
movement. Here also the principle holds good that the spirit is always more important
than the external form which it animates; since this form can be created mechanically
and quickly. For instance, the leadership principle may be imposed on an organized
political community in a dictatorial way. But this principle can become a living reality
only by passing through the stages that are necessary for its own evolution. These
stages lead from the smallest cell of the State organism upwards. As its bearers and
representatives, the leadership principle must have a body of men who have passed
through a process of selection lasting over several years, who have been tempered by
the hard realities of life and thus rendered capable of carrying the principle into
practical effect.

It is out of the question to think that a scheme for the Constitution of a State can be
pulled out of a portfolio at a moment's notice and 'introduced' by imperative orders
from above. One may try that kind of thing but the result will always be something that
has not sufficient vitality to endure. It will be like a stillborn infant. The idea of it calls to
mind the origin of the Weimar Constitution and the attempt to impose on the German
people a new Constitution and a new flag, neither of which had any inner relation to
the vicissitudes of our people's history during the last half century.
The National Socialist State must guard against all such experiments. It must grow out
of an organization which has already existed for a long time. This organization must
possess National Socialist life in itself, so that finally it may be able to establish a
National Socialist State that will be a living reality.

As I have already said, the germ cells of this State must lie in the administrative
chambers which will represent the various occupations and professions, therefore first
of all in the trades unions. If this subsequent vocational representation and the Central
Economic Parliament are to be National Socialist institutions, these important germ cells
must be vehicles of the National Socialist concept of life. The institutions of the
movement are to be brought over into the State; for the State cannot call into existence
all of a sudden and as if by magic those institutions which are necessary to its existence,
unless it wishes to have institutions that are bound to remain completely lifeless. 
Looking at the matter from the highest standpoint, the National Socialist Movement
will have to recognize the necessity of adopting its own trade-unionist policy.
It must do this for a further reason, namely because a real National Socialist education
for the employer as well as for the employee, in the spirit of a mutual co-operation
within the common framework of the national community, cannot be secured by
theoretical instruction, appeals and exhortations, but through the struggles of daily life.
In this spirit and through this spirit the movement must educate the several large
economic groups and bring them closer to one another under a wider outlook. Without
this preparatory work it would be sheer illusion to hope that a real national community
can be brought into existence. The great ideal represented by its philosophy of life and
for which the movement fights can alone form a general style of thought steadily and
slowly. And this style will show that the new state of things rests on foundations that
are internally sound and not merely an external façade.

Hence the movement must adopt a positive attitude towards the trade-unionist idea.
But it must go further than this. For the enormous number of members and followers of
the trade-unionist movement it must provide a practical education which will meet the
exigencies of the coming National Socialist State.

The answer to the third question follows from what has been already said.
The National Socialist Trades Union is not an instrument for class warfare, but a
representative organ of the various occupations and callings. The National Socialist
State recognizes no 'classes'. But, under the political aspect, it recognizes only citizens
with absolutely equal rights and equal obligations corresponding thereto. And, side by
side with these, it recognizes subjects of the State who have no political rights
whatsoever.

According to the National Socialist concept, it is not the task of the trades union to band together certain men within the national community and thus gradually transform these men into a class, so as to use them in a conflict against other groups similarly organized within the national community. 

We certainly cannot assign this task to the trades union as such. This was the task assigned to it the moment it became a fighting weapon in the hands of the Marxists.
