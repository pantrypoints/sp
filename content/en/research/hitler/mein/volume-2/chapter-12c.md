The trades union is not naturally an instrument of class warfare. 

But the Marxists transformed it into an instrument for use in their own class struggle. They created the economic weapon which the international Jew uses for the purpose of destroying the economic foundations of free and independent national States, for ruining their national industry and trade and thereby enslaving free nations to serve Jewish world-finance, which transcends all State boundaries.
 
In contradistinction to this, the National Socialist Trades Union must organize definite
groups and those who participate in the economic life of the nation and thus enhance
the security of the national economic system itself, reinforcing it by the elimination of
all those anomalies which ultimately exercise a destructive influence on the social body
of the nation, damaging the vital forces of the national community, prejudicing the
welfare of the State and, by no means as a last consequence, bringing evil and
destruction on economic life itself.

Therefore in the hands of the National Socialist Trades Union the strike is not an
instrument for disturbing and dislocating the national production, but for increasing it
and making it run smoothly, by fighting against all those annoyances which by reason
of their unsocial character hinder efficiency in business and thereby hamper the
existence of the whole nation. For individual efficiency stands always in casual relation
to the general social and juridical position of the individual in the economic process.
Individual efficiency is also the sole root of the conviction that the economic prosperity
of the nation must necessarily redound to the benefit of the individual citizen.
The National Socialist employee will have to recognize the fact that the economic
prosperity of the nation brings with it his own material happiness.
The National Socialist employer must recognize that the happiness and contentment of
his employees are necessary pre-requisites for the existence and development of his
own economic prosperity.

National Socialist workers and employers are both together the delegates and
mandatories of the whole national community. The large measure of personal freedom
which is accorded to them for their activities must be explained by the fact that
experience has shown that the productive powers of the individual are more enhanced
by being accorded a generous measure of freedom than by coercion from above.
Moreover, by according this freedom we give free play to the natural process of
selection which brings forward the ablest and most capable and most industrious. For
the National Socialist Trades Union, therefore, the strike is a means that may, and
indeed must, be resorted to as long as there is not a National Socialist State yet. But
when that State is established it will, as a matter of course, abolish the mass struggle
between the two great groups made up of employers and employees respectively, a
struggle which has always resulted in lessening the national production and injuring
the national community. In place of this struggle, the National Socialist State will take
over the task of caring for and defending the rights of all parties concerned. It will be
the duty of the Economic Chamber itself to keep the national economic system in
smooth working order and to remove whatever defects or errors it may suffer from.
Questions that are now fought over through a quarrel that involves millions of people
will then be settled in the Representative Chambers of Trades and Professions and in
the Central Economic Parliament. Thus employers and employees will no longer find 
themselves drawn into a mutual conflict over wages and hours of work, always to the
detriment of their mutual interests. But they will solve these problems together on a
higher plane, where the welfare of the national community and of the State will be as a
shining ideal to throw light on all their negotiations.

Here again, as everywhere else, the inflexible principle must be observed, that the
interests of the country must come before party interests.

The task of the National Socialist Trades Union will be to educate and prepare its
members to conform to these ideals. That task may be stated as follows: All must work
together for the maintenance and security of our people and the People's State, each one
according to the abilities and powers with which Nature has endowed him and which
have been developed and trained by the national community.
Our fourth question was: How shall we establish trades unions for such tasks and aims?
That is far more difficult to answer.

Generally speaking, it is easier to establish something in new territory than in old
territory which already has its established institutions. In a district where there is no
existing business of a special character one can easily establish a new business of this
character. But it is more difficult if the same kind of enterprise already exists and it is
most difficult of all when the conditions are such that only one enterprise of this kind
can prosper. For here the promoters of the new enterprise find themselves confronted
not only with the problem of introducing their own business but also that of how to
bring about the destruction of the other business already existing in the district, so that
the new enterprise may be able to exist.

It would be senseless to have a National Socialist Trades Union side by side with other
trades unions. For this Trades Union must be thoroughly imbued with a feeling for the
ideological nature of its task and of the resulting obligation not to tolerate other similar
or hostile institutions. It must also insist that itself alone is necessary, to the exclusion of
all the rest. It can come to no arrangement and no compromise with kindred tendencies
but must assert its own absolute and exclusive right.

There were two ways which might lead to such a development:
(1) We could establish our Trades Union and then gradually take up the fight against
the Marxist International Trades Union.

(2) Or we could enter the Marxist Trades Union and inculcate a new spirit in it, with the
idea of transforming it into an instrument in the service of the new ideal. 
The first way was not advisable, by reason of the fact that our financial situation was
still the cause of much worry to us at that time and our resources were quite slender.
The effects of the inflation were steadily spreading and made the particular situation
still more difficult for us, because in those years one could scarcely speak of any
material help which the trades unions could extend to their members. From this point
of view, there was no reason why the individual worker should pay his dues to the
union. Even the Marxist unions then existing were already on the point of collapse
until, as the result of Herr Cuno's enlightened Ruhr policy, millions were suddenly
poured into their coffers. This so-called 'national' Chancellor of the REICH should go
down in history as the Redeemer of the Marxist trades unions.
We could not count on similar financial facilities. And nobody could be induced to
enter a new Trades Union which, on account of its financial weakness, could not offer
him the slightest material benefit. On the other hand, I felt bound absolutely to guard
against the creation of such an organization which would only be a shelter for shirkers
of the more or less intellectual type.
At that time the question of personnel played the most important role. I did not have a
single man whom I might call upon to carry out this important task. Whoever could
have succeeded at that time in overthrowing the Marxist unions to make way for the
triumph of the National Socialist corporative idea, which would then take the place of
the ruinous class warfare--such a person would be fit to rank with the very greatest men
our nation has produced and his bust should be installed in the Valhalla at Regensburg
for the admiration of posterity.

But I knew of no person who could qualify for such a pedestal.
In this connection we must not be led astray by the fact that the international trades
unions are conducted by men of only mediocre significance, for when those unions
were founded there was nothing else of a similar kind already in existence. To-day the
National Socialist Movement must fight against a monster organization which has
existed for a long time, rests on gigantic foundations and is carefully constructed even
in the smallest details. An assailant must always exercise more intelligence than the
defender, if he is to overthrow the latter. The Marxist trade-unionist citadel may be
governed to-day by mediocre leaders, but it cannot be taken by assault except through
the dauntless energy and genius of a superior leader on the other side. If such a leader
cannot be found it is futile to struggle with Fate and even more foolish to try to
overthrow the existing state of things without being able to construct a better in its
place.

Here one must apply the maxim that in life it is often better to allow something to go by
the board rather than try to half do it or do it badly, owing to a lack of suitable means. 
To this we must add another consideration, which is not at all of a demagogic character.
At that time I had, and I still have to-day, a firmly rooted conviction that when one is
engaged in a great ideological struggle in the political field it would be a grave mistake
to mix up economic questions with this struggle in its earlier stages. This applies
particularly to our German people. For if such were to happen in their case the
economic struggle would immediately distract the energy necessary for the political
fight. Once the people are brought to believe that they can buy a little house with their
savings they will devote themselves to the task of increasing their savings and no spare
time will be left to them for the political struggle against those who, in one way or
another, will one day secure possession of the pennies that have been saved. Instead of
participating in the political conflict on behalf of the opinions and convictions which
they have been brought to accept they will now go further with their 'settlement' idea
and in the end they will find themselves for the most part sitting on the ground amidst
all the stools.

To-day the National Socialist Movement is at the beginning of its struggle. In great part
it must first of all shape and develop its ideals. It must employ every ounce of its energy
in the struggle to have its great ideal accepted, and the success of this effort is not
conceivable unless the combined energies of the movement be entirely at the service of
this struggle.

To-day we have a classical example of how the active strength of a people becomes
paralysed when that people is too much taken up with purely economic problems.
The Revolution which took place in November 1918 was not made by the trades unions,
but it was carried out in spite of them. And the people of Germany did not wage any
political fight for the future of their country because they thought that the future could
be sufficiently secured by constructive work in the economic field.
We must learn a lesson from this experience, because in our case the same thing must
happen under the same circumstances. The more the combined strength of our
movement is concentrated in the political struggle, the more confidently may we count
on being successful along our whole front. But if we busy ourselves prematurely with
trade unionist problems, settlement problems, etc., it will be to the disadvantage of our
own cause, taken as a whole. For, though these problems may be important, they
cannot be solved in an adequate manner until we have political power in our hand and
are able to use it in the service of this idea. Until that day comes these problems can
have only a paralysing effect on the movement. And if it takes them up too soon they
will only be a hindrance in the effort to attain its own ideological aims. It may then
easily happen that trade unionist considerations will control the political direction of
the movement, instead of the ideological aims of the movement directing the way that
the trades unions are to take. 

The movement and the nation can derive advantage from a National Socialist trade
unionist organization only if the latter be so thoroughly inspired by National Socialist
ideas that it runs no danger of falling into step behind the Marxist movement. For a
National Socialist Trades Union which would consider itself only as a competitor
against the Marxist unions would be worse than none. It must declare war against the
Marxist Trades Union, not only as an organization but, above all, as an idea. It must
declare itself hostile to the idea of class and class warfare and, in place of this, it must
declare itself as the defender of the various occupational and professional interests of
the German people.

Considered from all these points of view it was not then advisable, nor is it yet
advisable, to think of founding our own Trades Union. That seemed clear to me, at least
until somebody appeared who was obviously called by fate to solve this particular
problem.

Therefore there remained only two possible ways. Either to recommend our own party
members to leave the trades unions in which they were enrolled or to remain in them
for the moment, with the idea of causing as much destruction in them as possible.
In general, I recommended the latter alternative.
Especially in the year 1922-23 we could easily do that. For, during the period of
inflation, the financial advantages which might be reaped from a trades union
organization would be negligible, because we could expect to enroll only a few
members owing to the undeveloped condition of our movement. The damage which
might result from such a policy was all the greater because its bitterest critics and
opponents were to be found among the followers of the National Socialist Party.
I had already entirely discountenanced all experiments which were destined from the
very beginning to be unsuccessful. I would have considered it criminal to run the risk of
depriving a worker of his scant earnings in order to help an organization which,
according to my inner conviction, could not promise real advantages to its members.
Should a new political party fade out of existence one day nobody would be injured
thereby and some would have profited, but none would have a right to complain. For
what each individual contributes to a political movement is given with the idea that it
may ultimately come to nothing. But the man who pays his dues to a trade union has
the right to expect some guarantee in return. If this is not done, then the directors of
such a trade union are swindlers or at least careless people who ought to be brought to
a sense of their responsibilities.
We took all these viewpoints into consideration before making our decision in 1922.
Others thought otherwise and founded trades unions. They upbraided us for being 
short-sighted and failing to see into the future. But it did not take long for these
organizations to disappear and the result was what would have happened in our own
case. But the difference was that we should have deceived neither ourselves nor those
who believed in us.
