The REICH conducted its foreign affairs erratically due to a lack of sound guiding principles for the formation of practical and useful alliances. 

Not only was this state of affairs continued after the Revolution, but it became even worse.

Our defective statesmanship was caused by the confused state of our political ideas before the War.

But in the post-War period the cause is a lack of honest intentions. 

It was natural that those parties
who had fully achieved their destructive purpose by means of the Revolution should
feel that it would not serve their interests if a policy of alliances were adopted which
must ultimately result in the restoration of a free German State. 

A development in this direction would not be in conformity with the purposes of the November crime. 

It would have interrupted and indeed put an end to the internationalization of German
national economy and German Labour. 

But what was feared most of all was that a successful effort to make the REICH independent of foreign countries might have an influence in domestic politics which one day would turn out disastrous for those who
now hold supreme power in the government of the REICH. 

One cannot imagine the revival of a nation unless that revival be preceded by a process of nationalization.
Conversely, every important success in the field of foreign politics must call forth a
favourable reaction at home. 

Experience proves that every struggle for liberty increases the national sentiment and national self-consciousness and therewith gives rise to a keener sensibility towards anti-national elements and tendencies. A state of things, and
persons also, that may be tolerated and even pass unnoticed in times of peace will not
only become the object of aversion when national enthusiasm is aroused but will even
provoke positive opposition, which frequently turns out disastrous for them. In this
connection we may recall the spy-scare that became prevalent when the war broke out,
when human passion suddenly manifested itself to such a heightened degree as to lead
to the most brutal persecutions, often without any justifiable grounds, although
everybody knew that the danger resulting from spies is greater during the long periods
of peace; but, for obvious reasons, they do not then attract a similar amount of public
attention. For this reason the subtle instinct of the State parasites who came to the
surface of the national body through the November happenings makes them feel at
once that a policy of alliances which would restore the freedom of our people and
awaken national sentiment might possibly ruin their own criminal existence. 
Thus we may explain the fact that since 1918 the men who have held the reins of
government adopted an entirely negative attitude towards foreign affairs and that the
business of the State has been almost constantly conducted in a systematic way against
the interests of the German nation. For that which at first sight seemed a matter of
chance proved, on closer examination, to be a logical advance along the road which was
first publicly entered upon by the November Revolution of 1918.

Undoubtedly a distinction ought to be made between (1) the responsible administrators
of our affairs of State, or rather those who ought to be responsible; (2) the average run of
our parliamentary politicasters, and (3) the masses of our people, whose sheepish
docility corresponds to their want of intelligence.

The first know what they want. The second fall into line with them, either because they
have been already schooled in what is afoot or because they have not the courage to
take an uncompromising stand against a course which they know and feel to be
detrimental. The third just submit to it because they are too stupid to understand.
While the German National Socialist Labour Party was only a small and practically
unknown society, problems of foreign policy could have only a secondary importance
in the eyes of many of its members. This was the case especially because our movement
has always proclaimed the principle, and must proclaim it, that the freedom of the
country in its foreign relations is not a gift that will be bestowed upon us by Heaven or
by any earthly Powers, but can only be the fruit of a development of our inner forces.
We must first root out the causes which led to our collapse and we must eliminate all
those who are profiting by that collapse. Then we shall be in a position to take up the
fight for the restoration of our freedom in the management of our foreign relations.
It will be easily understood therefore why we did not attach so much importance to
foreign affairs during the early stages of our young movement, but preferred to
concentrate on the problem of internal reform.

But when the small and insignificant society expanded and finally grew too large for its
first framework, the young organization assumed the importance of a great association
and we then felt it incumbent on us to take a definite stand on problems regarding the
development of a foreign policy. It was necessary to lay down the main lines of action
which would not only be in accord with the fundamental ideas of our
WELTANSCHAUUNG but would actually be an expansion of it in the practical world
of foreign affairs.

Just because our people have had no political education in matters concerning our
relations abroad, it was necessary to teach the leaders in the various sections of our
movement, and also the masses of the people, the chief principles which ought to guide 
the development of our foreign relations. That was one of the first tasks to be
accomplished in order to prepare the ground for the practical carrying out of a foreign
policy which would win back the independence of the nation in managing its external
affairs and thus restore the real sovereignty of the REICH.
The fundamental and guiding principles which we must always bear in mind when
studying this question is that foreign policy is only a means to an end and that the sole
end to be pursued is the welfare of our own people. Every problem in foreign politics
must be considered from this point of view, and this point of view alone. Shall such and
such a solution prove advantageous to our people now or in the future, or will it injure
their interests? That is the question.

This is the sole preoccupation that must occupy our minds in dealing with a question.
Party politics, religious considerations, humanitarian ideals--all such and all other
preoccupations must absolutely give way to this.

Before the War the purpose to which German foreign policy should have been devoted
was to assure the supply of material necessities for the maintenance of our people and
their children. And the way should have been prepared which would lead to this goal.
Alliances should have been established which would have proved beneficial to us from
this point of view and would have brought us the necessary auxiliary support. The task
to be accomplished is the same to-day, but with this difference: In pre-War times it was
a question of caring for the maintenance of the German people, backed up by the power
which a strong and independent State then possessed, but our task to-day is to make
our nation powerful once again by re-establishing a strong and independent State. The
re-establishment of such a State is the prerequisite and necessary condition which must
be fulfilled in order that we may be able subsequently to put into practice a foreign
policy which will serve to guarantee the existence of our people in the future, fulfilling
their needs and furnishing them with those necessities of life which they lack. 

In other words, the aim which Germany ought to pursue to-day in her foreign policy is to prepare the way for the recovery of her liberty to-morrow. In this connection there is a fundamental principle which we must keep steadily before our minds. It is this: The
possibility of winning back the independence of a nation is not absolutely bound up
with the question of territorial reintegration but it will suffice if a small remnant, no
matter how small, of this nation and State will exist, provided it possesses the necessary
independence to become not only the vehicle of' the common spirit of the whole people
but also to prepare the way for the military fight to reconquer the nation's liberty.
When a people who amount to a hundred million souls tolerate the yoke of common
slavery in order to prevent the territory belonging to their State from being broken up
and divided, that is worse than if such a State and such a people were dismembered
while one fragment still retained its complete independence. Of course, the natural
proviso here is that this fragment must be inspired with a consciousness of the solemn 
duty that devolves upon it, not only to proclaim persistently the inviolable unity of its
spiritual and cultural life with that of its detached members but also to prepare the
means that are necessary for the military conflict which will finally liberate and re-unite
the fragments that are suffering under oppression.
