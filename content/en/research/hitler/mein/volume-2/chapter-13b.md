One must also bear in mind the fact that the restoration of lost districts which were
formerly parts of the State, both ethnically and politically, must in the first instance be a
question of winning back political power and independence for the motherland itself,
and that in such cases the special interests of the lost districts must be
uncompromisingly regarded as a matter of secondary importance in the face of the one
main task, which is to win back the freedom of the central territory. For the detached
and oppressed fragments of a nation or an imperial province cannot achieve their
liberation through the expression of yearnings and protests on the part of the oppressed
and abandoned, but only when the portion which has more or less retained its
sovereign independence can resort to the use of force for the purpose of reconquering
those territories that once belonged to the common fatherland.

Therefore, in order to reconquer lost territories the first condition to be fulfilled is to
work energetically for the increased welfare and reinforcement of the strength of that
portion of the State which has remained over after the partition. Thus the unquenchable
yearning which slumbers in the hearts of the people must be awakened and
restrengthened by bringing new forces to its aid, so that when the hour comes all will be
devoted to the one purpose of liberating and uniting the whole people. Therefore, the
interests of the separated territories must be subordinated to the one purpose. That one
purpose must aim at obtaining for the central remaining portion such a measure of
power and might that will enable it to enforce its will on the hostile will of the victor
and thus redress the wrong. For flaming protests will not restore the oppressed
territories to the bosom of a common REICH. That can be done only through the might
of the sword.

The forging of this sword is a work that has to be done through the domestic policy
which must be adopted by a national government. To see that the work of forging these
arms is assured, and to recruit the men who will bear them, that is the task of the
foreign policy.

In the first volume of this book I discussed the inadequacy of our policy of alliances
before the War. There were four possible ways to secure the necessary foodstuffs for the
maintenance of our people. Of these ways the fourth, which was the most unfavourable,
was chosen. Instead of a sound policy of territorial expansion in Europe, our rulers
embarked on a policy of colonial and trade expansion. That policy was all the more
mistaken inasmuch as they presumed that in this way the danger of an armed conflict
would be averted. The result of the attempt to sit on many stools at the same time might
have been foreseen. It let us fall to the ground in the midst of them all. And the World 
War was only the last reckoning presented to the REICH to pay for the failure of its
foreign policy.

The right way that should have been taken in those days was the third way I indicated:
namely, to increase the strength of the REICH as a Continental Power by the acquisition
of new territory in Europe. And at the same time a further expansion, through the
subsequent acquisition of colonial territory, might thus be brought within the range of
practical politics. Of course, this policy could not have been carried through except in
alliance with England, or by devoting such abnormal efforts to the increase of military
force and armament that, for forty or fifty years, all cultural undertakings would have
to be completely relegated to the background. This responsibility might very well have
been undertaken. The cultural importance of a nation is almost always dependent on its
political freedom and independence. Political freedom is a prerequisite condition for the
existence, or rather the creation, of great cultural undertakings. Accordingly no sacrifice
can be too great when there is question of securing the political freedom of a nation.

What might have to be deducted from the budget expenses for cultural purposes, in
order to meet abnormal demands for increasing the military power of the State, can be
generously paid back later on. Indeed, it may be said that after a State has concentrated
all its resources in one effort for the purpose of securing its political independence a
certain period of ease and renewed equilibrium sets in. And it often happens that the
cultural spirit of the nation, which had been heretofore cramped and confined, now
suddenly blooms forth. Thus Greece experienced the great Periclean era after the
miseries it had suffered during the Persian Wars. And the Roman Republic turned its
energies to the cultivation of a higher civilization when it was freed from the stress and
worry of the Punic Wars.

Of course, it could not be expected that a parliamentary majority of feckless and stupid
people would be capable of deciding on such a resolute policy for the absolute
subordination of all other national interests to the one sole task of preparing for a future
conflict of arms which would result in establishing the security of the State. The father
of Frederick the Great sacrificed everything in order to be ready for that conflict; but the
fathers of our absurd parliamentarian democracy, with the Jewish hall-mark, could not
do it.

That is why, in pre-War times, the military preparation necessary to enable us to
conquer new territory in Europe was only very mediocre, so that it was difficult to
obtain the support of really helpful allies.
Those who directed our foreign affairs would not entertain even the idea of
systematically preparing for war. They rejected every plan for the acquisition of
territory in Europe. And by preferring a policy of colonial and trade expansion, they
sacrificed the alliance with England, which was then possible. At the same time they
neglected to seek the support of Russia, which would have been a logical proceeding. 
Finally they stumbled into the World War, abandoned by all except the ill-starred
Habsburgs.
The characteristic of our present foreign policy is that it follows no discernible or even
intelligible lines of action. Whereas before the War a mistake was made in taking the
fourth way that I have mentioned, and this was pursued only in a halfhearted manner,
since the Revolution not even the sharpest eye can detect any way that is being
followed. Even more than before the War, there is absolutely no such thing as a
systematic plan, except the systematic attempts that are made to destroy the last
possibility of a national revival.
If we make an impartial examination of the situation existing in Europe to-day as far as
concerns the relation of the various Powers to one another, we shall arrive at the
following results:

For the past three hundred years the history of our Continent has been definitely
determined by England's efforts to keep the European States opposed to one another in
an equilibrium of forces, thus assuring the necessary protection of her own rear while
she pursued the great aims of British world-policy.
The traditional tendency of British diplomacy ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth
has been to employ systematically every possible means to prevent any one Power from
attaining a preponderant position over the other European Powers and, if necessary, to
break that preponderance by means of armed intervention. The only parallel to this has
been the tradition of the Prussian Army. England has made use of various forces to
carry out its purpose, choosing them according to the actual situation or the task to be
faced; but the will and determination to use them has always been the same. The more
difficult England's position became in the course of history the more the British
Imperial Government considered it necessary to maintain a condition of political
paralysis among the various European States, as a result of their mutual rivalries. 

When the North American colonies obtained their political independence it became still more
necessary for England to use every effort to establish and maintain the defence of her
flank in Europe. In accordance with this policy she reduced Spain and the Netherlands
to the position of inferior naval Powers. Having accomplished this, England
concentrated all her forces against the increasing strength of France, until she brought
about the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte and therewith destroyed the military
hegemony of France, which was the most dangerous rival that England had to fear.

The change of attitude in British statesmanship towards Germany took place only very
slowly, not only because the German nation did not represent an obvious danger for
England as long as it lacked national unification, but also because public opinion in
England, which had been directed to other quarters by a system of propaganda that had
been carried out for a long time, could be turned to a new direction only by slow 
degrees.

In order to reach the proposed ends the calmly reflecting statesman had to bow
to popular sentiment, which is the most powerful motive-force and is at the same time
the most lasting in its energy. When the statesman has attained one of his ends, he must
immediately turn his thoughts to others; but only by degrees and the slow work of
propaganda can the sentiment of the masses be shaped into an instrument for the
attainment of the new aims which their leaders have decided on.

As early as 1870-71 England had decided on the new stand it would take. On certain
occasions minor oscillations in that policy were caused by the growing influence of
America in the commercial markets of the world and also by the increasing political
power of Russia; but, unfortunately, Germany did not take advantage of these and,
therefore, the original tendency of British diplomacy was only reinforced.
England looked upon Germany as a Power which was of world importance
commercially and politically and which, partly because of its enormous industrial
development, assumed such threatening proportions that the two countries already
contended against one another in the same sphere and with equal energy. The so-called
peaceful conquest of the world by commercial enterprise, which, in the eyes of those
who governed our public affairs at that time, represented the highest peak of human
wisdom, was just the thing that led English statesmen to adopt a policy of resistance.
That this resistance assumed the form of an organized aggression on a vast scale was in
full conformity with a type of statesmanship which did not aim at the maintenance of a
dubious world peace but aimed at the consolidation of British world-hegemony. In
carrying out this policy, England allied herself with those countries which had a
definite military importance. And that was in keeping with her traditional caution in
estimating the power of her adversary and also in recognizing her own temporary
weakness. That line of conduct cannot be called unscrupulous; because such a
comprehensive organization for war purposes must not be judged from the heroic point
of view but from that of expediency. The object of a diplomatic policy must not be to see
that a nation goes down heroically but rather that it survives in a practical way. Hence
every road that leads to this goal is opportune and the failure to take it must be looked
upon as a criminal neglect of duty.
When the German Revolution took place England's fears of a German world hegemony
came to a satisfactory end.

From that time it was not an English interest to see Germany totally cancelled from the
geographic map of Europe. On the contrary, the astounding collapse which took place
in November 1918 found British diplomacy confronted with a situation which at first
appeared untenable.
