For 4.5 years, the British Empire had fought to break the presumed preponderance of a Continental Power. A sudden collapse now happened which removed this Power from the foreground of European affairs. 

That collapse disclosed itself finally in the lack of even the primordial instinct of self-preservation, so that
European equilibrium was destroyed within 48 hours. 

Germany was annihilated and France became the first political Power on the Continent of Europe.

The tremendous propaganda which was carried on during this war for the purpose of
encouraging the British public to stick it out to the end aroused all the primitive
instincts and passions of the populace and was bound eventually to hang as a leaden
weight on the decisions of British statesmen. With the colonial, economical and
commercial destruction of Germany, England's war aims were attained. Whatever went
beyond those aims was an obstacle to the furtherance of British interests. 

Only the enemies of England could profit by the disappearance of Germany as a Great
Continental Power in Europe. In November 1918, however, and up to the summer of
1919, it was not possible for England to change its diplomatic attitude; because during
the long war it had appealed, more than it had ever done before, to the feelings of the
populace. In view of the feeling prevalent among its own people, England could not
change its foreign policy; and another reason which made that impossible was the
military strength to which other European Powers had now attained. France had taken
the direction of peace negotiations into her own hands and could impose her law upon
the others. During those months of negotiations and bargaining the only Power that
could have altered the course which things were taking was Germany herself; but
Germany was torn asunder by a civil war, and her so-called statesmen had declared
themselves ready to accept any and every dictate imposed on them.

Now, in the comity of nations, when one nation loses its instinct for self-preservation
and ceases to be an active member it sinks to the level of an enslaved nation and its
territory will have to suffer the fate of a colony.

To prevent the power of France from becoming too great, the only form which English
negotiations could take was that of participating in France's lust for aggrandizement.
As a matter of fact, England did not attain the ends for which she went to war. Not only
did it turn out impossible to prevent a Continental Power from obtaining a
preponderance over the ratio of strength in the Continental State system of Europe, but
a large measure of preponderance had been obtained and firmly established.

In 1914 Germany, considered as a military State, was wedged in between two countries,
one of which had equal military forces at its disposal and the other had greater military
resources. Then there was England's overwhelming supremacy at sea. France and
Russia alone hindered and opposed the excessive aggrandizement of Germany. The
unfavourable geographical situation of the REICH, from the military point of view,
might be looked upon as another coefficient of security against an exaggerated increase
of German power. From the naval point of view, the configuration of the coast-line was 
unfavourable in case of a conflict with England. And though the maritime frontier was
short and cramped, the land frontier was widely extended and open.
France's position is different to-day. It is the first military Power without a serious rival
on the Continent. It is almost entirely protected by its southern frontier against Spain
and Italy. Against Germany it is safeguarded by the prostrate condition of our country.
A long stretch of its coast-line faces the vital nervous system of the British Empire. Not
only could French aeroplanes and long-range batteries attack the vital centres of the
British system, but submarines can threaten the great British commercial routes. A
submarine campaign based on France's long Atlantic coast and on the European and
North African coasts of the Mediterranean would have disastrous consequences for
England.

Thus the political results of the war to prevent the development of German power was
the creation of a French hegemony on the Continent. The military result was the
consolidation of France as the first Continental Power and the recognition of American
equality on the sea. The economic result was the cession of great spheres of British
interests to her former allies and associates.
The Balkanization of Europe, up to a certain degree, was desirable and indeed
necessary in the light of the traditional policy of Great Britain, just as France desired the
Balkanization of Germany.
What England has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent any one
Continental Power in Europe from attaining a position of world importance. Therefore
England wishes to maintain a definite equilibrium of forces among the European States-
-for this equilibrium seems a necessary condition of England's world-hegemony.
What France has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent Germany
from becoming a homogeneous Power. Therefore France wants to maintain a system of
small German States whose forces would balance one another and over which there
should be no central government. Then, by acquiring possession of the left bank of the
Rhine, she would have fulfilled the pre-requisite conditions for the establishment and
security of her hegemony in Europe.
The final aims of French diplomacy must be in perpetual opposition to the final
tendencies of British statesmanship.

Taking these considerations as a starting-point, anyone who investigates the
possibilities that exist for Germany to find allies must come to the conclusion that there
remains no other way of forming an alliance except to approach England. The
consequences of England's war policy were and are disastrous for Germany. However,
we cannot close our eyes to the fact that, as things stand to-day, the necessary interests 
of England no longer demand the destruction of Germany. On the contrary, British
diplomacy must tend more and more, from year to year, towards curbing France's
unbridled lust after hegemony. Now, a policy of alliances cannot be pursued by bearing
past grievances in mind, but it can be rendered fruitful by taking account of past
experiences. Experience should have taught us that alliances formed for negative
purposes suffer from intrinsic weakness. The destinies of nations can be welded
together only under the prospect of a common success, of common gain and conquest,
in short, a common extension of power for both contracting parties.

The ignorance of our people on questions of foreign politics is clearly demonstrated by
the reports in the daily Press which talk about "friendship towards Germany" on the
part of one or the other foreign statesman, whereby this professed friendship is taken as
a special guarantee that such persons will champion a policy that will be advantageous
to our people. That kind of talk is absurd to an incredible degree. It means speculating
on the unparalleled simplicity of the average German philistine when he comes to
talking politics. There is not any British, American, or Italian statesman who could ever
be described as 'pro-German'. Every Englishman must naturally be British first of all.
The same is true of every American. And no Italian statesman would be prepared to
adopt a policy that was not pro-Italian. Therefore, anyone who expects to form alliances
with foreign nations on the basis of a pro-German feeling among the statesmen of other
countries is either an ass or a deceiver. The necessary condition for linking together the
destinies of nations is never mutual esteem or mutual sympathy, but rather the prospect
of advantages accruing to the contracting parties. It is true that a British statesman will
always follow a pro-British and not a pro-German policy; but it is also true that certain
definite interests involved in this pro-British policy may coincide on various grounds
with German interests. Naturally that can be so only to a certain degree and the
situation may one day be completely reversed. But the art of statesmanship is shown
when at certain periods there is question of reaching a certain end and when allies are
found who must take the same road in order to defend their own interests.

The practical application of these principles at the present time must depend on the
answer given to the following questions: What States are not vitally interested in the
fact that, by the complete abolition of a German Central Europe, the economic and
military power of France has reached a position of absolute hegemony? Which are the
States that, in consideration of the conditions which are essential to their own existence
and in view of the tradition that has hitherto been followed in conducting their foreign
policy, envisage such a development as a menace to their own future?

Finally, we must be quite clear on the following point: France is and will remain the
implacable enemy of Germany. It does not matter what Governments have ruled or will
rule in France, whether Bourbon or Jacobin, Napoleonic or Bourgeois-Democratic,
Clerical Republican or Red Bolshevik, their foreign policy will always be directed 
towards acquiring possession of the Rhine frontier and consolidating France's position
on this river by disuniting and dismembering Germany.
England did not want Germany to be a world Power. France desired that there should
be no Power called Germany. Therefore there was a very essential difference. To-day
we are not fighting for our position as a World-Power but only for the existence of our
country, for national unity and the daily bread of our children. Taking this point of
view into consideration, only two States remain to us as possible allies in Europe--
England and Italy.

England is not pleased to see a France on whose military power there is no check in
Europe, so that one day she might undertake the support of a policy which in some way
or other might come into conflict with British interests. Nor can England be pleased to
see France in possession of such enormous coal and iron mines in Western Europe as
would make it possible for her one day to play a role in world-commerce which might
threaten danger to British interests. Moreover, England can never be pleased to see a
France whose political position on the Continent, owing to the dismemberment of the
rest of Europe, seems so absolutely assured that she is not only able to resume a French
world-policy on great lines but would even find herself compelled to do so. The bombs
which were once dropped by the Zeppelins might be multiplied by the thousand every
night. The military predominance of France is a weight that presses heavily on the
hearts of the World Empire over which Great Britain rules.
Nor can Italy desire, nor will she desire, any further strengthening of France's power in
Europe. The future of Italy will be conditioned by the development of events in the
Mediterranean and by the political situation in the area surrounding that sea. The
reason that led Italy into the War was not a desire to contribute towards the
aggrandizement of France but rather to deal her hated Adriatic rival a mortal blow. Any
further increase of France's power on the Continent would hamper the development of
Italy's future, and Italy does not deceive herself by thinking that racial kindred between
the nations will in any way eliminate rivalries.
Serious and impartial consideration proves that it is these two States, Great Britain and
Italy, whose natural interests not only do not contrast with the conditions essential to
the existence of the German nation but are identical with them, to a certain extent.
But when we consider the possibilities of alliances we must be careful not to lose sight
of three factors. The first factor concerns ourselves; the other two concern the 2 States I have mentioned.

Is it at all possible to conclude an alliance with Germany as it is to-day? Can a Power which would enter into an alliance for the purpose of securing assistance in an effort to carry out its own OFFENSIVE aims--can such a Power form an alliance with a State whose rulers have for years long presented a spectacle of deplorable incompetence and pacifist cowardice and where the majority of the people, blinded by democratic and Marxist teachings, betray the interests of their own people and country in a manner that cries to Heaven for vengeance? As things stand to-day, can any Power hope to establish useful relations and hope to fight together for the furtherance of their common interests with this State which manifestly has neither the will nor the courage to move a finger even in the defence of its bare existence? Take the case of a Power for which an alliance must be much more than a pact to guarantee a state of slow decomposition, such as happened with the old and disastrous Triple Alliance. Can such a Power associate itself for life or death with a State whose most characteristic signs of activity consist of a rampant servility in external relations and a scandalous repression of the national spirit at home? Can such a Power be associated with a State in which there is nothing of greatness, because its whole policy does not deserve it? Or can alliances be made with Governments which are in the hands of men who are despised by their own fellowcitizens and consequently are not respected abroad?

No. A self-respecting Power which expects something more from alliances than commissions for greedy Parliamentarians will not and cannot enter into an alliance with our present-day Germany. Our present inability to form alliances furnishes the principle and most solid basis for the combined action of the enemies who are robbing us. Because Germany does not defend itself in any other way except by the flamboyant protests of our parliamentarian elect, there is no reason why the rest of the world should take up the fight in our defence. And God does not follow the principle of granting freedom to a nation of cowards, despite all the implications of our 'patriotic' associations. Therefore, for those States which have not a direct interest in our annihilation no other course remains open except to participate in France's campaign of plunder, at least to make it impossible for the strength of France to be exclusively aggrandized thereby.
