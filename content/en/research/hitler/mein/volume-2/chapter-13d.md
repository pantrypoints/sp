In the second place, among the nations which were formerly our enemies mass-propaganda has turned the opinions and feelings of large sections of the population in a fixed direction. When for years long a foreign nation has been presented to the public as a horde of 'Huns', 'Robbers', 'Vandals', etc., they cannot suddenly be presented as something different, and the enemy of yesterday cannot be recommended as the ally of tomorrow.

But the third factor deserves greater attention, since it is of essential importance for establishing future alliances in Europe.

Politically, it is not in the interests of Great Britain that Germany should be ruined even still more, but such a proceeding would be very much in the interests of the international money-markets manipulated by the Jew. The cleavage
between the official, or rather traditional, British statesmanship and the controlling 
influence of the Jew on the money-markets is nowhere so clearly manifested as in the
various attitudes taken towards problems of British foreign policy. 

Contrary to the interests and welfare of the British State, Jewish finance demands not only the absolute
economic destruction of Germany but its complete political enslavement. The internationalization of our German economic system, that is to say, the transference of our productive forces to the control of Jewish international finance, can be completely carried out only in a State that has been politically Bolshevized. 

But the Marxist fighting forces, commanded by international and Jewish stock-exchange capital, cannot finally smash the national resistance in Germany without friendly help from outside. For this
purpose French armies would first have to invade and overcome the territory of the
German REICH until a state of international chaos would set in, and then the country
would have to succumb to Bolshevik storm troops in the service of Jewish international
finance.

Hence it is that at the present time the Jew is the great agitator for the complete
destruction of Germany. Whenever we read of attacks against Germany taking place in
any part of the world the Jew is always the instigator. In peace-time, as well as during
the War, the Jewish-Marxist stock-exchange Press systematically stirred up hatred
against Germany, until one State after another abandoned its neutrality and placed
itself at the service of the world coalition, even against the real interests of its own
people.

The Jewish way of reasoning thus becomes quite clear. The Bolshevization of Germany,
that is to say, the extermination of the patriotic and national German intellectuals, thus
making it possible to force German Labour to bear the yoke of international Jewish
finance--that is only the overture to the movement for expanding Jewish power on a
wider scale and finally subjugating the world to its rule. As has so often happened in
history, Germany is the chief pivot of this formidable struggle. If our people and our
State should fall victims to these oppressors of the nations, lusting after blood and
money, the whole earth would become the prey of that hydra. Should Germany be
freed from its grip, a great menace for the nations of the world would thereby be
eliminated.

Jewry uses all its subterranean activities for:
- keeping alive old national enmities against Germany
- spreading them farther and more acute

<!-- It is no less certain that these activities
are only very partially in keeping with the true interests of the nations among whose
people the poison is spread. As a general principle, Jewry carries on its campaign in the
various countries by the use of arguments that are best calculated to appeal to the
mentality of the respective nations and are most likely to produce the desired results;
for  -->

Jewry knows what the public feeling is in each country. Our national stock has been so much adulterated by the mixture of alien elements that, in its fight for power, Jewry can make use of the more or less 'cosmopolitan' circles which exist among us, inspired  by the pacifist and international ideologies.

In France, they exploit the well-known and accurately estimated chauvinistic spirit. In England they exploit the commercial and world-political outlook. 

In short, they always work upon the essential characteristics that belong to the mentality of each nation. When they have in this way achieved a decisive influence in the political and economic spheres they can drop the limitations
which their former tactics necessitated, now disclosing their real intentions and the ends
for which they are fighting. Their work of destruction now goes ahead more quickly,
reducing one State after another to a mass of ruins on which they will erect the
everlasting and sovereign Jewish Empire.

In England, and in Italy, the contrast between the better kind of solid statesmanship and
the policy of the Jewish stock-exchange often becomes strikingly evident.

Only in France there exists to-day more than ever before a profound accord between the
views of the stock-exchange, controlled by the Jews, and the chauvinistic policy
pursued by French statesmen. This identity of views constitutes an immense, danger for
Germany.

This is why France is and will remain by far the most dangerous enemy. 

The French are becoming more obsessed by negroid ideas which threaten the white race in Europe, because they are bound up with the Jewish campaign for world-domination.

For the contamination caused by the influx of negroid blood on the Rhine, in the very
heart of Europe, is in accord with the sadist and perverse lust for vengeance on the part
of the hereditary enemy of our people, just as it suits the purpose of the cool calculating
Jew who would use this means of introducing a process of bastardization in the very
centre of the European Continent and, by infecting the white race with the blood of an
inferior stock, would destroy the foundations of its independent existence.

France's activities in Europe to-day, spurred on by the French lust for vengeance and systematically directed by the Jew, are a criminal attack against the life of the white race and will one day arouse against the French people a spirit of vengeance among a generation which will have recognized the original sin of mankind in this racial
pollution.

As far as concerns Germany, the danger which France represents involves the duty of relegating all sentiment to a subordinate place and extending the hand to those who are threatened with the same menace and who are not willing to suffer or tolerate France's lust for hegemony.

For a long time yet to come there will be only two Powers in Europe with which it may
be possible for Germany to conclude an alliance. These Powers are Great Britain and
Italy. 

If we take the trouble to cast a glance backwards on the way in which German foreign
policy has been conducted since the Revolution we must, in view of the constant and
incomprehensible acts of submission on the part. of our governments, either lose heart
or become fired with rage and take up the cudgels against such a regime. 

Their way of acting cannot be attributed to a want of understanding, because what seemed to every
thinking man to be inconceivable was accomplished by the leaders of the November
parties with their Cyclopean intellects. 

They bowed to France and begged her favour.

Yes, during all these recent years, with the touching simplicity of incorrigible
visionaries, they went on their knees to France again and again. They perpetuaily
wagged their tails before the GRANDE NATION. And in each trick-o'-the-loop which
the French hangmen performed with his rope they recognized a visible change of
feeling. Our real political wire-pullers never shared in this absurd credulity. The idea of
establishing a friendship with France was for them only a means of thwarting every
attempt on Germany's part to adopt a practical policy of alliances. They had no illusions
about French aims or those of the men behind the scenes in France. What induced them
to take up such an attitude and to act as if they honestly believed that the fate of
Germany could possibly be changed in this way was the cool calculation that if this did
not happen our people might take the reins into their own hands and choose another
road.

It is difficult for us to propose England as our possible ally in the future. Our Jewish Press has always been adept in concentrating hatred against England particularly. And many of our good German simpletons perch on these branches which the Jews have limed to capture them. They babble about a restoration of German sea
power and protest against the robbery of our colonies. Thus they furnish material which
the contriving Jew transmits to his clansmen in England, so that it can be used there for
purposes of practical propaganda. 

For our simple-minded bourgeoisie who indulge in
politics can take in only little by little the idea that to-day we have not to fight for 'seapower' and such things. Even before the War it was absurd to direct the national
energies of Germany towards this end without first having secured our position in
Europe. Such a hope to-day reaches that peak of absurdity which may be called
criminal in the domain of politics.

Often one becomes really desperate on seeing how the Jewish wire-pullers succeeded in concentrating the attention of the people on things which are only of secondary importance to-day, They incited the people to demonstrations and protests while at the same time France was tearing our nation asunder bit by bit and systematically removing the very foundations of our national independence. In this connection I have to think of the Wooden Horse in the riding of which the Jew showed extraordinary skill during these years. I mean South Tyrol. Yes, South Tyrol. 

I answer this here because I want to call to account that shameful CANAILLE who relied on the ignorance and short memories of large sections of our people and stimulated a national indignation which is as foreign to the real character of our parliamentary impostors as the idea of respect for private property is to a magpie.

I was one of those who, at the time when the fate of South Tyrol was being decided--that is to say, from August 1914 to November 1918--took my place where that country also could have been effectively defended, namely, in the Army. I did my share in the fighting during those years, not merely to save South Tyrol from being lost but also to save every other German province for the Fatherland. The parliamentary sharpers did not take part in that combat. The whole CANAILLE played party politics. On the other hand, we carried on the fight in the belief that a victorious issue of the War would enable the German nation to keep South Tyrol also; but the loud-mouthed traitor carried on a seditious agitation against such a victorious issue, until the fighting Siegfried succumbed to the dagger plunged in his back. It was only natural that the inflammatory and hypocritical speeches of the elegantly dressed  parliamentarians on the Vienna RATHAUS PLATZ or in front of the FELDHERRNHALLE in Munich could not save South Tyrol for Germany. 

That could be done only by the fighting battalions at the Front. Those who broke up that fighting front betrayed South Tyrol, as well as the other districts of Germany. Anyone who thinks that the South Tyrol question can be solved to-day by protests and manifestations and processions organized by various associations is either a humbug or merely a German philistine.
