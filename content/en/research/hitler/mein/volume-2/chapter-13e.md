We cannot get back the territories we have lost if we depend on solemn imprecations before God or a League of Nations, but only by the force of arms.

Therefore the only remaining question is: Who is ready to take up arms for the
restoration of the lost territories?

Personally, I would have courage enough to take part in a campaign for the reconquest of South Tyrol, at the head of parliamentarian storm battalions consisting of parliamentarian gasconaders and all the party leaders, also the various Councillors of State. 

Only the Devil knows whether I might have the luck of seeing a few shells suddenly burst over this 'burning' demonstration of protest. I think that if a fox were to break into a poultry yard his presence would not provoke such a helter-skelter and rush to cover as we should witness in the band of 'protesters'. 

The vilest part of it all is that these talkers themselves do not believe that anything can
be achieved in this way. Each one of them knows very well how harmless and
ineffective their whole pretence is. They do it only because it is easier now to babble
about the restoration of South Tyrol than to fight for its preservation in days gone by.
Each one plays the part that he is best capable of playing in life. In those days we
offered our blood. To-day these people are engaged in whetting their tusks.

Today, legitimist circles in Vienna preen themselves on their work for the restoration of South Tyrol. 

Seven years ago, their august and illustrious Dynasty helped, by an act of perjury and treason, to make it possible for the victorious world-coalition to take away South Tyrol. 

At that time these circles supported the perfidious policy adopted by their Dynasty and did not trouble themselves in the least about the fate of South Tyrol or any other province. 

Naturally it is easier to-day to take up the fight for this territory, since the present struggle is waged
with 'the weapons of the mind'. Anyhow, it is easier to join in a 'meeting of protestation'
and talk yourself hoarse in giving vent to the noble indignation that fills your breast, or
stain your finger with the writing of a newspaper article, than to blow up a bridge, for
instance, during the occupation of the Ruhr.

The reason why certain circles have made the question of South Tyrol the pivot of
German-Italian relations during the past few years is quite evident. Jews and Habsburg
legitimists are greatly interested in preventing Germany from pursuing a policy of
alliance which might lead one day to the resurgence of a free German fatherland. 

It is not out of love for South Tyrol that they play this role to-day--for their policy would
turn out detrimental rather than helpful to the interests of that province--but through
fear of an agreement being established between Germany and Italy.

A tendency towards lying and calumny lies in the nature of these people, and that
explains how they can calmly and brazenly attempt to twist things in such a way as to
make it appear that we have 'betrayed' South Tyrol.

My answer is that Tyrol has been betrayed by:

1. Every German who was sound in limb and body and did not offer himself for service at the Front during 1914-1918 to do his duty towards his country.

2. Every man who, during those years did not help to reinforce the national spirit and the national powers of resistance, so as to enable the country to carry through the War and keep up the fight to the very end. 

3. Everyone who took part in the November Revolution, either directly by his act or indirectly by a cowardly toleration of it, and thus broke the sole weapon that could have saved South Tyrol.

4. Those parties and their adherents who put their signatures to the disgraceful treaties of Versailles and St. Germain. 


Today I am guided by a calm and cool recognition of the fact that 

The lost territories can only be won back by force. 

<!-- the whetted tongues of parliamentary spouters but only by the
whetted sword; in other words, through a fight where blood will have to be shed.
Now, I have no hesitations in saying that to-day,  -->

Once the die has been cast, it is not only impossible to win back South Tyrol through a war but I should definitely take my stand against such a movement, because I am convinced that it would not be possible to arouse the national enthusiasm of the German people and maintain it in such a way as would be necessary in order to carry through such a war to a successful issue. 

On the contrary, I believe that if we have to shed German blood once again it would be criminal to do so for the sake of liberating 200,000 Germans, when more than seven million neighbouring Germans are suffering under foreign domination and a vital artery of the German nation has become a playground for hordes of African niggers.

If the German nation is to put an end to a state of things which threatens to wipe it off the map of Europe it must not fall into the errors of the pre-War period and make the whole world its enemy. But it must ascertain who is its most dangerous enemy so that it can concentrate all its forces in a struggle to beat him. And if, in order to carry through this struggle to victory, sacrifices should be made in other quarters, future generations will not condemn us for that. 

They will take account of the miseries and anxieties which led us to make such a bitter decision, and in the light of that consideration they will more clearly recognize the brilliancy of our success. Again I must say here that we must always be guided by the fundamental principle that, as a preliminary to winning back lost provinces, the political independence and strength of the motherland must first be restored. The first task which has to be accomplished is to make that independence possible and to secure it by a wise policy of alliances, which presupposes an energetic management of our public affairs.

But it is just on this point that we, National Socialists, have to guard against being
dragged into the tow of our ranting bourgeois patriots who take their cue from the Jew. 


It would be a disaster if, instead of preparing for the coming struggle, our Movement
also were to busy itself with mere protests by word of mouth.

It was the fantastic idea of a Nibelungen alliance with the decomposed body of the Habsburg State that brought about Germany's ruin. 

Fantastic sentimentality in dealing with the possibilities of foreign policy to-day would be the best means of preventing our revival for innumerable years to come.

I answer the objections to my 3 questions:

1. Is it possible at all to form an alliance with the present Germany, whose weakness is so visible to all eyes?

2. Can the ex-enemy nations change their attitude towards Germany?

3. In other nations is not the influence of Jewry stronger than the recognition of their own interests, and does not this influence thwart all their good intentions and render all their plans futile?

I think that I have already dealt adequately with one of the two aspects of the first point. Of course nobody will enter into an alliance with the present Germany. No Power in the world would link its fortunes with a State whose government does not afford grounds for the slightest confidence. As regards the attempt which has been made by many of our compatriots to explain the conduct of the Government by referring to the woeful state of public feeling and thus excuse such conduct, I must strongly object to that way of looking at things.

The lack of character which our people have shown during the last six years is deeply distressing. The indifference with which they have treated the most urgent necessities of our nation might veritably lead one to despair. Their cowardice is such that it often cries to heaven for vengeance. But one must never forget that we are dealing with a people who gave to the world, a few years previously, an admirable example of the highest human qualities. 

From the first days of August 1914 to the end of the tremendous struggle between the nations, no people in the world gave a better proof of manly courage, tenacity and patient endurance, than this people gave who are so cast down and dispirited today. 

Nobody will dare to assert that the lack of character among our people to-day is typical of them. What we have to endure to-day, among us and around us, is due only to the influence of the sad and distressing effects that followed the high treason committed on November 9th, 1918. More than ever before the word of the poet is true: that evil can only give rise to evil. But even in this epoch those qualities among our people which are fundamentally sound are not entirely lost.

They slumber in the depths of the national conscience, and sometimes in the clouded firmament we see certain qualities like shining lights which Germany will one day remember as the first symptoms of a revival. We often see young Germans assembling and forming determined resolutions, as they did in 1914, freely and willingly to offer themselves as a sacrifice on the altar of their beloved Fatherland. Millions of men have resumed work, whole-heartedly and zealously, as if no revolution had ever affected them. The smith is at his anvil once again. And the farmer drives his plough. The scientist is in his laboratory. And everybody is once again attending to his duty with the same zeal and devotion as formerly.

The oppression which we suffer from at the hands of our enemies is no longer taken, as
it formerly was, as a matter for laughter; but it is resented with bitterness and anger.

A great change of attitude has taken place.

This evolution has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and movement to
restore the political power and independence of our nation; but the blame for this must
be attributed to those utterly incompetent people who have no natural endowments to qualify them for statesmanship and yet have been governing our nation since 1918 and leading it to ruin.

Yes. If anybody accuses our people to-day he ought to be asked: What is being done to help them? What are we to say of the poor support which the people give to any measures introduced by the Government? Is it not true that such a thing as a Government hardly exists at all? And must we consider the poor support which it receives as a sign of a lack of vitality in the nation itself; or is it not rather a proof of the complete failure of the methods employed in the management of this valuable trust? 

What have our Governments done to re-awaken in the nation a proud spirit of selfassertion, up-standing manliness, and a spirit of righteous defiance towards its enemies?
