In 1919, when the Peace Treaty was imposed on the German nation, there were grounds for hoping that this instrument of unrestricted oppression would help to reinforce the outcry for the freedom of Germany. Peace treaties which make demands that fall like a whip-lash on the people turn out not infrequently to be the signal of a future revival.
To what purpose could the Treaty of Versailles have been exploited?

In the hands of a willing Government, how could this instrument of unlimited
blackmail and shameful humiliation have been applied for the purpose of arousing
national sentiment to its highest pitch? How could a well-directed system of
propaganda have utilized the sadist cruelty of that treaty so as to change the
indifference of the people to a feeling of indignation and transform that indignation into
a spirit of dauntless resistance?


Each point of that Treaty could have been engraved on the minds and hearts of the German people and burned into them until sixty million men and women would find their souls aflame with a feeling of rage and shame; and a torrent of fire would burst forth as from a furnace, and one common will would be forged from it, like a sword of
steel. Then the people would join in the common cry: "To arms again!"

Yes. A treaty of that kind can be used for such a purpose. Its unbounded oppression
and its impudent demands were an excellent propaganda weapon to arouse the
sluggish spirit of the nation and restore its vitality.

Then, from the child's story-book to the last newspaper in the country, and every
theatre and cinema, every pillar where placards are posted and every free space on the
hoardings should be utilized in the service of this one great mission, until the fainthearted cry, "Lord, deliver us," which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven today would be transformed into an ardent prayer: "Almighty God, bless our arms when the hour comes. Be just, as Thou hast always been just. Judge now if we deserve our
freedom. Lord, bless our struggle."

All opportunities were neglected and nothing was done.
Who will be surprised now if our people are not such as they should be or might be?
The rest of the world looks upon us only as its valet, or as a kindly dog that will lick its
master's hand after he has been whipped.
Of course the possibilities of forming alliances with other nations are hampered by the
indifference of our own people, but much more by our Governments. They have been
and are so corrupt that now, after eight years of indescribable oppression, there exists
only a faint desire for liberty.
In order that our nation may undertake a policy of alliances, it must restore its prestige
among other nations, and it must have an authoritative Government that is not a
drudge in the service of foreign States and the taskmaster of its own people, but rather
the herald of the national will.

If our people had a government which would look upon this as its mission, six years
would not have passed before a courageous foreign policy on the part of the REICH
would find a corresponding support among the people, whose desire for freedom
would be encouraged and intensified thereby.

3. The third objection is the difficulty of changing the ex-enemy nations into allies.

I answer that the general anti-German psychosis which has developed in other countries through the
war propaganda must of necessity continue to exist as long as there is not a renaissance
of the national conscience among the German people, so that the German REICH may
once again become a State which is able to play its part on the chess-board of European
politics and with whom the others feel that they can play. Only when the Government
and the people feel absolutely certain of being able to undertake a policy of alliances can
one Power or another, whose interests coincide with ours, think of instituting a system
of propaganda for the purpose of changing public opinion among its own people.

Naturally it will take several years of persevering and ably directed work to reach such
a result. Just because a long period is needed in order to change the public opinion of a
country, it is necessary to reflect calmly before such an enterprise be undertaken. This
means that one must not enter upon this kind of work unless one is absolutely
convinced that it is worth the trouble and that it will bring results which will be
valuable in the future. One must not try to change the opinions and feelings of a people
by basing one's actions on the vain cajolery of a more or less brilliant Foreign Minister,
but only if there be a tangible guarantee that the new orientation will be really useful.

Otherwise public opinion in the country dealt with may be just thrown into a state of
complete confusion. The most reliable guarantee that can be given for the possibility of
subsequently entering into an alliance with a certain State cannot be found in the
loquacious suavity of some individual member of the Government, but in the manifest
stability of a definite and practical policy on the part of the Government as a whole, and
in the support which is given to that policy by the public opinion of the country. The
faith of the public in this policy will be strengthened all the more if the Government
organize one active propaganda to explain its efforts and secure public support for
them, and if public opinion favourably responds to the Government's policy.

Therefore a nation in such a position as ours will be looked upon as a possible ally if
public opinion supports the Government's policy and if both are united in the same
enthusiastic determination to carry through the fight for national freedom. That
condition of affairs must be firmly established before any attempt can be made to
change public opinion in other countries which, for the sake of defending their most
elementary interests, are disposed to take the road shoulder-to-shoulder with a
companion who seems able to play his part in defending those interests. In other words,
this means that they will be ready to establish an alliance.

For this purpose, however, one thing is necessary. Seeing that the task of bringing about
a radical change in the public opinion of a country calls for hard work, and many do not
at first understand what it means, it would be both foolish and criminal to commit
mistakes which could be used as weapons in the hands of those who are opposed to
such a change.

One must recognize the fact that it takes a long time for a people to understand
completely the inner purposes which a Government has in view, because it is not 
possible to explain the ultimate aims of the preparations that are being made to carry
through a certain policy. In such cases the Government has to count on the blind faith of
the masses or the intuitive instinct of the ruling caste that is more developed
intellectually. But since many people lack this insight, this political acumen and faculty
for seeing into the trend of affairs, and since political considerations forbid a public
explanation of why such and such a course is being followed, a certain number of
leaders in intellectual circles will always oppose new tendencies which, because they
are not easily grasped, can be pointed to as mere experiments. And that attitude arouses
opposition among conservative circles regarding the measures in question.
For this reason a strict duty devolves upon everybody not to allow any weapon to fall
into the hands of those who would interfere with the work of bringing about a mutual
understanding with other nations. This is specially so in our case, where we have to
deal with the pretentions and fantastic talk of our patriotic associations and our small
bourgeoisie who talk politics in the cafes. That the cry for a new war fleet, the
restoration of our colonies, etc., has no chance of ever being carried out in practice will
not be denied by anyone who thinks over the matter calmly and seriously. These
harmless and sometimes half-crazy spouters in the war of protests are serving the
interests of our mortal enemy, while the manner in which their vapourings are
exploited for political purposes in England cannot be considered as advantageous to
Germany.

They squander their energies in futile demonstrations against the whole world. These
demonstrations are harmful to our interests and those who indulge in them forget the
fundamental principle which is a preliminary condition of all success. What thou doest,
do it thoroughly. Because we keep on howling against five or ten States we fail to
concentrate all the forces of our national will and our physical strength for a blow at the
heart of our bitterest enemy. And in this way we sacrifice the possibility of securing an
alliance which would reinforce our strength for that decisive conflict.
Here, too, there is a mission for National Socialism to fulfil. It must teach our people not
to fix their attention on the little things but rather on the great things, not to exhaust
their energies on secondary objects, and not to forget that the object we shall have to
fight for one day is the bare existence of our people and that the sole enemy we shall
have to strike at is that Power which is robbing us of this existence.
It may be that we shall have many a heavy burden to bear. But this is by no means an
excuse for refusing to listen to reason and raise nonsensical outcries against the rest of
the world, instead of concentrating all our forces against the most deadly enemy.
Moreover, the German people will have no moral right to complain of the manner in
which the rest of the world acts towards them, as long as they themselves have not
called to account those criminals who sold and betrayed their own country. We cannot 
hope to be taken very seriously if we indulge in long-range abuse and protests against
England and Italy and then allow those scoundrels to circulate undisturbed in our own
country who were in the pay of the enemy war propaganda, took the weapons out of
our hands, broke the backbone of our resistance and bartered away the REICH for
thirty pieces of silver.
The enemy did only what was expected. And we ought to learn from the stand he took
and the way he acted.

Anyone who cannot rise to the level of this outlook must reflect that otherwise there
would remain nothing else than to renounce the idea of adopting any policy of alliances
for the future. For if we cannot form an alliance with England because she has robbed
us of our colonies, or with Italy because she has taken possession of South Tyrol, or
with Poland or Czechoslovakia, then there remains no other possibility of an alliance in
Europe except with France which, inter alia, has robbed us of Alsace and Lorraine.

There can scarcely be any doubt as to whether this last alternative would be advantageous to the interests of the German people. But if it be defended by somebody one is always doubtful whether that person be merely a simpleton or an astute rogue. As far as concerns the leaders in these activities, I think the latter hypothesis is true. A change in public feeling among those nations which have hitherto been enemies and whose true interests will correspond in the future with ours could be effected, as far as human calculation goes, if the internal strength of our State and our manifest determination to secure our own existence made it clear that we should be valuable allies. Moreover, it is necessary that our incompetent way of doing things and our criminal conduct in some matters should not furnish grounds which may be utilized for purposes of propaganda by those who would oppose our projects of establishing an alliance with one or other of our former enemies.

The answer to the third question is still more difficult: Is it conceivable that they who
represent the true interests of those nations which may possibly form an alliance with
us could put their views into practice against the will of the Jew, who is the mortal
enemy of national and independent popular States?

For instance, could the motive-forces of Great Britain's traditional statesmanship smash the disastrous influence of the Jew, or could they not? This question, as I have already said, is very difficult to answer. The answer depends on so many factors that it is impossible to form a conclusive judgment. Anyhow, one thing is certain: The power of the Government in a given State and at a definite period may be so firmly established in the public estimation and so absolutely at the service of the country's interests that the forces of international Jewry could not possibly organize a real and effective obstruction against measures considered to be politically necessary.
