The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry's 3 principal weapons, the
profound reasons for which may not have been consciously understood (though I do
not believe this myself) furnishes the best proof that the poison fangs of that Power
which transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect way.

The prohibition of Freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of the
supernational Press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the steadily
increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State--all this will enable the
Italian Government, in the course of some years, to advance more and more the
interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the hissing of the Jewish
world-hydra.

The English situation is not so favourable. 

England has 'the freest democracy' where the Jew dictates his will, almost unrestrained but indirectly through his influence on public opinion.

And yet there is a perpetual struggle in England between those who are entrusted with the defence of State interests and the protagonists of
Jewish world-dictatorship.

After the War it became clear for the first time how sharp this contrast is, when British
statesmanship took one stand on the Japanese problem and the Press took a different
stand.

Just after the War had ceased the old mutual antipathy between America and Japan
began to reappear. Naturally the great European Powers could not remain indifferent to
this new war menace.

In England, despite the ties of kinship, there was a certain amount of jealousy and anxiety over the growing importance of the United States in all spheres of international economics and politics. What was formerly a colonial territory,
the daughter of a great mother, seemed about to become the new mistress of the world.

It is quite understandable that to-day England should re-examine her old alliances and that British statesmanship should look anxiously to the danger of a coming moment when the cry would no longer be: "Britain rules the waves", but rather: "The Seas belong to the United States".

The gigantic North American State, with the enormous resources of its virgin soil, is
much more invulnerable than the encircled German REICH. 

Should a day come when the die which will finally decide the destinies of the nations will have to be cast in that
country, England would be doomed if she stood alone. Therefore she eagerly reaches
out her hand to a member of the yellow race and enters an alliance which, from the
racial point of view is perhaps unpardonable; but from the political viewpoint it
represents the sole possibility of reinforcing Britain's world position in face of the
strenuous developments taking place on the American continent. 

They fought side by side on the European battlefields. 

Yet the British Government did not conclude an alliance with the Asiatic partner, yet the whole Jewish Press opposed a Japanese alliance.

How can we explain the fact that up to 1918 the Jewish Press championed the policy of
the British Government against the German REICH and then suddenly began to take its
own way and showed itself disloyal to the Government?

It was not in the interests of Great Britain to have Germany annihilated, but primarily a
Jewish interest. And to-day the destruction of Japan would serve British political
interests less than it would serve the far-reaching intentions of those who are leading
the movement that hopes to establish a Jewish world-empire. While England is using all
her endeavours to maintain her position in the world, the Jew is organizing his
aggressive plans for the conquest of it.

He already sees the present European States as pliant instruments in his hands, whether
indirectly through the power of so-called Western Democracy or in the form of a direct
domination through Russian Bolshevism. But it is not only the old world that he holds
in his snare; for a like fate threatens the new world. Jews control the financial forces of
America on the stock exchange. Year after year the Jew increases his hold on Labour in
a nation of 120 million souls. But a very small section still remains quite independent
and is thus the cause of chagrin to the Jew.
The Jews show consummate skill in manipulating public opinion and using it as an
instrument in fighting for their own future.
The great leaders of Jewry are confident that the day is near at hand when the
command given in the Old Testament will be carried out and the Jews will devour the
other nations of the earth.

Among this great mass of denationalized countries which have become Jewish colonies
one independent State could bring about the ruin of the whole structure at the last
moment. The reason for doing this would be that Bolshevism as a world-system cannot
continue to exist unless it encompasses the whole earth. Should one State preserve its
national strength and its national greatness the empire of the Jewish satrapy, like every
other tyranny, would have to succumb to the force of the national idea.
As a result of his millennial experience in accommodating himself to surrounding
circumstances, the Jew knows very well that he can undermine the existence of
European nations by a process of racial bastardization, but that he could hardly do the
same to a national Asiatic State like Japan. To-day he can ape the ways of the German
and the Englishman, the American and the Frenchman, but he has no means of 
approach to the yellow Asiatic. Therefore he seeks to destroy the Japanese national State
by using other national States as his instruments, so that he may rid himself of a
dangerous opponent before he takes over supreme control of the last national State and
transforms that control into a tyranny for the oppression of the defenceless.
He does not want to see a national Japanese State in existence when he founds his
millennial empire of the future, and therefore he wants to destroy it before establishing
his own dictatorship.

And so he is busy to-day in stirring up antipathy towards Japan among the other
nations, as he stirred it up against Germany. Thus it may happen that while British
statesmanship is still endeavouring to ground its policy in the alliance with Japan, the
Jewish Press in Great Britain may be at the same time leading a hostile movement
against that ally and preparing for a war of destruction by pretending that it is for the
triumph of democracy and at the same time raising the war-cry: Down with Japanese
militarism and imperialism.

Thus in England to-day the Jew opposes the policy of the State. And for this reason the
struggle against the Jewish world-danger will one day begin also in that country.
And here again the National Socialist Movement has a tremendous task before it.
It must open the eyes of our people in regard to foreign nations and it must continually
remind them of the real enemy who menaces the world to-day. In place of preaching
hatred against Aryans from whom we may be separated on almost every other ground
but with whom the bond of kindred blood and the main features of a common
civilization unite us, we must devote ourselves to arousing general indignation against
the maleficent enemy of humanity and the real author of all our sufferings.
The National Socialist Movement must see to it that at least in our own country the
mortal enemy is recognized and that the fight against him may be a beacon light
pointing to a new and better period for other nations as well as showing the way of
salvation for Aryan humanity in the struggle for its existence.

Finally, may reason be our guide and will-power our strength. And may the sacred
duty of directing our conduct as I have pointed out give us perseverance and tenacity;
and may our faith be our supreme protection.
