The deep mysteries of this most important problem must have been known not only to the German-National prophets but also to those who had the direction of British history in their hands. 

It is right down puerile to suppose that in England itself the importance of India for the British Empire was not adequately appreciated. 

It is a proof of having learned nothing from the world war and of thoroughly misunderstanding or knowing nothing about Anglo-Saxon determination, when they imagine that England could lose India without first having put forth the last ounce of her strength in the struggle to hold it. 

Moreover, it shows how complete is the ignorance prevailing in Germany as to the manner in which the spirit of England
permeates and administers her Empire. England will never lose India unless she admits
racial disruption in the machinery of her administration (which at present is entirely out
of the question in India) or unless she is overcome by the sword of some powerful 
enemy. 

But Indian risings will never bring this about. We Germans have had sufficient experience to know how hard it is to coerce England. And, apart from all this, I as a German would far rather see India under British domination than under that of any other nation.

The hopes of an epic rising in Egypt were just as chimerical. The 'Holy War' may bring
the pleasing illusion to our German nincompoops that others are now ready to shed
their blood for them. Indeed, this cowardly speculation is almost always the father of
such hopes. But in reality the illusion would soon be brought to an end under the
fusillade from a few companies of British machine-guns and a hail of British bombs.

A coalition of cripples cannot attack a powerful State which is determined, if necessary,
to shed the last drop of its blood to maintain its existence. To me, as a nationalist who
appreciates the worth of the racial basis of humanity, I must recognize the racial
inferiority of the so-called 'Oppressed Nations', and that is enough to prevent me from
linking the destiny of my people with the destiny of those inferior races.

Today we must take up the same sort of attitude also towards Russia. The Russia of today, deprived of its Germanic ruling class, is not a possible ally in the struggle for German liberty, setting aside entirely the inner designs of its new rulers. From the purely military viewpoint a Russo-German coalition waging war against Western
Europe, and probably against the whole world on that account, would be catastrophic
for us. 

The struggle would have to be fought out, not on Russian but on German
territory, without Germany being able to receive from Russia the slightest effective
support. The means of power at the disposal of the present German REICH are so
miserable and so inadequate to the waging of a foreign war that it would be impossible
to defend our frontiers against Western Europe, England included. And the industrial
area of Germany would have to be abandoned undefended to the concentrated attack of
our adversaries. It must be added that between Germany and Russia there is the Polish
State, completely in the hands of the French. In case Germany and Russia together
should wage war against Western Europe, Russia would have to overthrow Poland
before the first Russian soldier could arrive on the German front.

But it is not so much a question of soldiers as of technical equipment. 

In this regard we should have our situation in the world war repeated, but in a more terrible manner. At that time German industry had to be drained to help our glorious allies, and from the technical side
Germany had to carry on the war almost alone.

In this new hypothetical war Russia, as a technical factor, would count for nothing. We should have practically nothing to oppose to the general motorization of the world, which in the next war will make its
appearance in an overwhelming and decisive form. 

In this important field Germany has
not only shamefully lagged behind, but with the little it has it would have to reinforce
Russia, which at the present moment does not possess a single factory capable of
producing a motor gun-wagon. Under such conditions the presupposed coming
struggle would assume the character of sheer slaughter.

The German youth would have to shed more of its blood than it did even in the world war; for, as always, the honour of
fighting will fall on us alone, and the result would be an inevitable catastrophe. But
even admitting that a miracle were produced and that this war did not end in the total
annihilation of Germany, the final result would be that the German nation would be
bled white, and, surrounded by great military States, its real situation would be in no
way ameliorated.


It is useless to object here that in case of an alliance with Russia we should not think of
an immediate war or that, anyhow, we should have means of making thorough
preparations for war. No. An alliance which is not for the purpose of waging war has
no meaning and no value. Even though at the moment when an alliance is concluded
the prospect of war is a distant one, still the idea of the situation developing towards
war is the profound reason for entering into an alliance. 

It is out of the question to think
that the other Powers would be deceived as to the purpose of such an alliance. A RussoGerman coalition would remain either a matter of so much paper--and in this case it would have no meaning for us--or the letter of the treaty would be put into practice visibly, and in that case the rest of the world would be warned. It would be childish to
think that in such circumstances England and France would wait for ten years to give
the Russo-German alliance time to complete its technical preparations. No. The storm
would break over Germany immediately.

Therefore the fact of forming an alliance with Russia would be the signal for a new war.

The result of that would be the end of Germany.

To these considerations the following must be added:

1. Those who are in power in Russia today have no idea of forming an honourable alliance or of remaining true to it, if they did.

The present rulers of Russia are blood-stained criminals who:
- overran a great State
- degraded and extirpated millions of educated people out of sheer blood-lust
- for nearly ten years they have ruled with such a savage tyranny as was never known before. 

These rulers belong to a people in whom the most bestial cruelty is allied with a capacity for
artful mendacity and believes itself to-day more than ever called to impose its
sanguinary despotism on the rest of the world. 

It must not be forgotten that the
international Jew, who is to-day the absolute master of Russia, does not look upon
Germany as an ally but as a State condemned to the same doom as Russia. One does not
form an alliance with a partner whose only aim is the destruction of his fellow-partner.
Above all, one does not enter into alliances with people for whom no treaty is sacred;
because they do not move about this earth as men of honour and sincerity but as the
representatives of lies and deception, thievery and plunder and robbery. The man who 
thinks that he can bind himself by treaty with parasites is like the tree that believes it
can form a profitable bargain with the ivy that surrounds it.

2. The menace to which Russia once succumbed is hanging steadily over Germany. 

Only a bourgeois simpleton could imagine that Bolshevism can be tamed. In his superficial way of thinking he does not suspect that here we are dealing with a phenomenon that is due to an urge of the blood: namely, the aspiration of the Jewish
people to become the despots of the world. That aspiration is quite as natural as the
impulse of the Anglo-Saxon to sit in the seats of rulership all over the earth. And as the
Anglo-Saxon chooses his own way of reaching those ends and fights for them with his
characteristic weapons, so also does the Jew. 

The Jew wriggles his way in among the
body of the nations and bores them hollow from inside. The weapons with which he
works are lies and calumny, poisonous infection and disintegration, until he has ruined
his hated adversary. In Russian Bolshevism we ought to recognize the kind of attempt
which is being made by the Jew in the twentieth century to secure dominion over the
world. In other epochs he worked towards the same goal but with different, though at
bottom similar, means. The kind of effort which the Jew puts forth springs from the
deepest roots in the nature of his being. A people does not of itself renounce the
impulse to increase its stock and power. Only external circumstances or senile
impotence can force them to renounce this urge. In the same way the Jew will never
spontaneously give up his march towards the goal of world dictatorship or repress his
external urge. He can be thrown back on his road only by forces that are exterior to him,
for his instinct towards world domination will die out only with himself. The impotence
of nations and their extinction through senility can come only when their blood has
remained no longer pure. And the Jewish people preserve the purity of their blood
better than any other nation on earth. Therefore the Jew follows his destined road until
he is opposed by a force superior to him. And then a desperate struggle takes place to
send back to Lucifer him who would assault the heavens.
