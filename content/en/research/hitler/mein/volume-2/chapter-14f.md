Today Germany is the next battlefield for Russian Bolshevism. 

All the force of a fresh missionary idea is needed to raise up our nation once more, to rescue it from the coils of the international serpent and stop the process of corruption which is taking place in the
internal constitution of our blood; so that the forces of our nation, once liberated, may
be employed to preserve our nationality and prevent the repetition of the recent
catastrophe from taking place even in the most distant future. If this be the goal we set
to ourselves it would be folly to ally ourselves with a country whose master is the
mortal enemy of our future. 

How can we release our people from this poisonous grip if
we accept the same grip ourselves? How can we teach the German worker that
Bolshevism is an infamous crime against humanity if we ally ourselves with this
infernal abortion and recognize its existence as legitimate. With what right shall we
condemn the members of the broad masses whose sympathies lie with a certain
WELTANSCHAUUNG if the rulers of our State choose the representatives of that
WELTANSCHAUUNG as their allies? The struggle against the Jewish Bolshevization of 
the world demands that we should declare our position towards Soviet Russia. We
cannot cast out the Devil through Beelzebub. If nationalist circles to-day grow
enthusiastic about the idea of an alliance with Bolshevism, then let them look around
only in Germany and recognize from what quarter they are being supported. Do these
nationalists believe that a policy which is recommended and acclaimed by the Marxist
international Press can be beneficial for the German people? Since when has the Jew
acted as shield-bearer for the militant nationalist?

One special reproach which could be made against the old German REICH with regard
to its policy of alliances was that it spoiled its relations towards all others by continually
swinging now this way and now that way and by its weakness in trying to preserve
world peace at all costs. But one reproach which cannot be made against it is that it did
not continue to maintain good relations with Russia.

I admit frankly that before the War I thought it would have been better if Germany had
abandoned her senseless colonial policy and her naval policy and had joined England in
an alliance against Russia, therewith renouncing her weak world policy for a
determined European policy, with the idea of acquiring new territory on the Continent.
I do not forget the constant insolent threats which Pan-Slavist Russia made against
Germany. I do not forget the continual trial mobilizations, the sole object of which was
to irritate Germany. I cannot forget the tone of public opinion in Russia which in preWar days excelled itself in hate-inspired outbursts against our nation and REICH. Nor
can I forget the big Russian Press which was always more favourable to France than to
us.
But, in spite of everything, there was still a second way possible before the War. We
might have won the support of Russia and turned against England. Circumstances are
entirely different to-day. If, before the War, throwing all sentiment to the winds, we
could have marched by the side of Russia, that is no longer possible for us to-day. Since
then the hand of the world-clock has moved forward. The hour has struck and struck
loudly, when the destiny of our people must be decided one way or another.
The present consolidation of the great States of the world is the last warning signal for
us to look to ourselves and bring our people back from their land of visions to the land
of hard truth and point the way into the future, on which alone the old REICH can
march triumphantly once again.

If, in view of this great and most important task placed before it, the National Socialist
Movement sets aside all illusions and takes reason as its sole effective guide the
catastrophe of 1918 may turn out to be an infinite blessing for the future of our nation.
From the lesson of that collapse it may formulate an entirely new orientation for the
conduct of its foreign policy. Internally reinforced through its new
WELTANSCHAUUNG, the German nation may reach a final stabilization of its policy 
towards the outside world. It may end by gaining what England has, what even Russia
had, and what France again and again utilized as the ultimate grounds on which she
was able to base correct decisions for her own interests: namely, A Political Testament.
Political Testament of the German Nation ought to lay down the following rules, which
will be always valid for its conduct towards the outside world:

Never permit two Continental Powers to arise in Europe. Should any attempt be made
to organize a second military Power on the German frontier by the creation of a State
which may become a Military Power, with the prospect of an aggression against
Germany in view, such an event confers on Germany not only the right but the duty to
prevent by every means, including military means, the creation of such a State and to
crush it if created. See to it that the strength of our nation does not rest on colonial
foundations but on those of our own native territory in Europe. Never consider the
REICH secure unless, for centuries to come, it is in a position to give every descendant
of our race a piece of ground and soil that he can call his own. Never forget that the
most sacred of all rights in this world is man's right to the earth which he wishes to
cultivate for himself and that the holiest of all sacrifices is that of the blood poured out
for it.

I should not like to close this chapter without referring once again to the one sole
possibility of alliances that exists for us in Europe at the present moment. In speaking of
the German alliance problem in the present chapter I mentioned England and Italy as
the only countries with which it would be worth while for us to strive to form a close
alliance and that this alliance would be advantageous. I should like here to underline
again the military importance of such an alliance.

The military consequences of forming this alliance would be the direct opposite of the
consequences of an alliance with Russia. Most important of all is the fact that a
RAPPROCHEMENT with England and Italy would in no way involve a danger of war.
The only Power that could oppose such an arrangement would be France; and France
would not be in a position to make war. But the alliance should allow to Germany the
possibility of making those preparations in all tranquillity which, within the framework
of such a coalition, might in one way or another be requisite in view of a regulation of
accounts with France. For the full significance of such an alliance lies in the fact that on
its conclusion Germany would no longer be subject to the threat of a sudden invasion.
The coalition against her would disappear automatically; that is to say, the Entente
which brought such disaster to us. Thus France, the mortal enemy of our people, would
be isolated. And even though at first this success would have only a moral effect, it
would be sufficient to give Germany such liberty of action as we cannot now imagine.
For the new Anglo-German-Italian alliance would hold the political initiative and no
longer France. 

A further success would be that at one stroke Germany would be delivered from her
unfavourable strategical situation. On the one side her flank would be strongly
protected; and, on the other, the assurance of being able to import her foodstuffs and
raw materials would be a beneficial result of this new alignment of States. But almost of
greater importance would be the fact that this new League would include States that
possess technical qualities which mutually supplement each other. For the first time
Germany would have allies who would not be as vampires on her economic body but
would contribute their part to complete our technical equipment. And we must not
forget a final fact: namely, that in this case we should not have allies resembling Turkey
and Russia to-day. The greatest World Power on this earth and a young national State
would supply far other elements for a struggle in Europe than the putrescent carcasses
of the States with which Germany was allied in the last war.

As I have already said, great difficulties would naturally be made to hinder the
conclusion of such an alliance. But was not the formation of the Entente somewhat more
difficult? Where King Edward VII succeeded partly against interests that were of their
nature opposed to his work we must and will succeed, if the recognition of the necessity
of such a development so inspires us that we shall be able to act with skill and conquer
our own feelings in carrying the policy through. This will be possible when, incited to
action by the miseries of our situation, we shall adopt a definite purpose and follow it
out systematically instead of the defective foreign policy of the last decades, which
never had a fixed purpose in view.

The future goal of our foreign policy ought not to involve an orientation to the East or
the West, but it ought to be an Eastern policy which will have in view the acquisition of
such territory as is necessary for our German people. To carry out this policy we need
that force which the mortal enemy of our nation, France, now deprives us of by holding
us in her grip and pitilessly robbing us of our strength. 

Therefore we must stop at no sacrifice in our effort to destroy the French striving towards hegemony over Europe. As
our natural ally to-day we have every Power on the Continent that feels France's lust for
hegemony in Europe unbearable. 

No attempt to approach those Powers ought to appear too difficult for us, and no sacrifice should be considered too heavy, if the final outcome would be to make it possible for us to overthrow our bitterest enemy. The
minor wounds will be cured by the beneficent influence of time, once the ground
wounds have been cauterized and closed.

Naturally the internal enemies of our people will howl with rage. But this will not
succeed in forcing us as National Socialists to cease our preaching in favour of that
which our most profound conviction tells us to be necessary. We must oppose the
current of public opinion which will be driven mad by Jewish cunning in exploiting our
German thoughtlessness. 

The waves of this public opinion often rage and roar against us; but the man who swims with the current attracts less attention than he who buffets it. 

Today we are but a rock in the river. 

In a few years Fate may raise us up as a dam  against which the general current will be broken, only to flow forward in a new bed. 

Therefore it is necessary that in the eyes of the rest of the world our movement should be recognized as representing a definite and determined political programme. We should bear on our visors the distinguishing sign of that task which Heaven expects us to fulfil.

When we ourselves are fully aware of the ineluctable necessity which determines our external policy this knowledge will fill us with the grit which we need in order to stand up with equanimity under the bombardment launched against us by the enemy Press and to hold firm when some insinuating voice whispers that we ought to give ground
here and there in order not to have all against us and that we might sometimes howl
with the wolves.
