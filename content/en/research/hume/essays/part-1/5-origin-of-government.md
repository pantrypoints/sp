A man, who is born in a family, is compelled to maintain society from:
- necessity
- natural inclination, and
- habit

To further progress, he establishes political society in order to administer justice. Without justice, there can be no peace, safety, nor mutual intercourse among them. Therefore, the only purpose of the vast apparatus of our government is to distribute justice, or, in other words, support the 12 judges. 

The following are needed for their part of administration:
- kings and parliaments
- fleets and armies
- officers of the court and revenue
- ambassadors
- ministers
- privy-counsellors

The clergy's duty is to inculcate morality. Other than that, they have no use.

All men know the necessity of:
- justice to maintain peace and order.
- peace and order to maintain society.

Despite this strong and obvious necessity, <!-- our nature is so frail and perverse that  -->it is impossible to keep men faithfully within justice. 

People are usually tempted to get immediate but unlawful gain. This great weakness is incurable in human nature. Men must, therefore, try to palliate what they cannot cure.

<!-- Some extraordinary circumstances may happen, in which a man finds his interests to be more promoted by fraud or rapine, than hurt by the breach which his injustice makes in the social union.

But much more frequently, he is seduced from his great and important, but distant interests, by the allurement of present, though often very frivolous temptations. -->

They must institute some persons, called magistrates, whose peculiar job is to:
- point out the decrees of equity
- punish transgressors
- correct fraud and violence
- oblige men, however reluctant, to consult their own real and permanent interests.

Thus, Obedience is a new duty invented to support Justice. <!-- The ties of equity must be corroborated by those of allegiance. But still, abstractly, nothing is gained by this alliance. -->

From their very nature, the factitious duty of obedience and the primitive <!-- and natural  -->duty of justice have a feeble hold on the human mind. Peculiar interests may overcome either or both. <!-- the one and the other. They are equally exposed to the same inconvenience. -->
- The bad neighbour must be led by his selfish interest <!--  the same motives --> to be a bad citizen.
- The magistrate himself might be negligent, partial, or unjust<!--  in his administration -->.

Experience, however, proves, that there is  between the cases.

However, there is a great difference between the importance of obedience and that of justice.

The order in society is much better maintained by a government than be private people. Our duty to the magistrate is more natural than our <!-- strictly guarded by the principles of human nature, than our --> duty to our fellow-citizens. 

<!-- Many people will submit to, and court all the dangers, and fatigues, and cares of government.
Men, once raised to that station, though often led astray by private passions, find, in ordinary cases, a visible interest in 
 -->
The love of dominion is so strong. This causes disorders which lead people to need the impartial administration of justice.  Those people who become the first administrators by the people's consent <!-- , tacit or express, of the people, --> must have superior valour, force, integrity, or prudence -- these command respect and confidence.

After government is established, a regard to birth, rank, and station has a mighty influence over men, and enforces the decrees of the magistrate. The leader exclaims against every disorder.
- He summons all his partizans and all men of probity to help him correct it.
- He is readily followed by people in this.
- He soon acquires the power of rewarding these services.
- In time, he establishes subordinate ministers and a military force who an immediate interest to support his authority.
- Habit soon turns this interest into obedience. 
<!--  consolidates what other principles of human nature had imperfectly founded. -->
- Once used to obedience, men never think of departing from this path.<!--  such a path that they and their ancestors have constantly trod. -->
<!-- This path confines them by so many urgent and visible motives.
But this progress of human affairs may appear certain and inevitable. -->

Obedience naturally supports justice. <!-- The support which allegiance brings to justice is founded on obvious principles of human nature. --> However, men are not expected to discover their connection beforehand, or foresee how they work<!-- their their operation -->. Normally, government commences more casually and more imperfectly.

The leadership of one man over many probably began during a state of war, where:
- the superiority of courage and genius is seen,
- the unanimity and concert are most needed, and
- the pernicious effects of disorder are most sensibly felt.

War is common among savage tribes. Its long continuance <!-- enured --> forced the people to submission.
The chieftain the arbiter if had much equity, prudence, and valour. <!-- , he became, even during peace,  of all differences. --> He could gradually establish his authority by mixting force and consent.

This gave benefit to <!--  sensibly felt from his influence, made it be cherished by --> the people<!-- , at least by the peaceable and well disposed among them -->.
If his son had the same good qualities, government advanced to maturity and perfection. But it was still in a feeble state, until the <!--  the farther progress of improvement procured the  -->magistrate had a revenue. This would enable him to:
- give rewards, <!--  on the several instruments of his administration, --> and
- inflict punishments <!-- on the refractory° and disobedient. -->
Before that period, each exertion of his influence must have been particular, and founded on the peculiar circumstances.

After that, submission was no longer a matter of choice. Instead, it was exacted by the authority of the supreme magistrate.

There is a perpetual struggle between Authority and Liberty in all governments. Neither of them can ever absolutely prevail. A great sacrifice of liberty must necessarily be made in every government.

Yet even the authority which confines liberty can never and should never become absolute.
- The sultan is master of the life and fortune of any individual. But he will not be permitted to impose new taxes on his subjects.
- A French monarch can impose taxes at pleasure. But it is dangerous for him to attempt the lives and fortunes of individuals.

In most countries, religion is also commonly a very intractable principle. Other principles or prejudices frequently resist all the authority of the civil magistrate.
**The civil magistrate's power is founded on opinion.**

It can never subvert other opinions, equally rooted with that of his title to dominion.

### Perfect liberty is the separation of powers under an authority, with the laws known to all

A government is free if:
- it splits power among several members and their united authority is greater or equal to the monarch,
- its members act according to general and equal laws that are known to all the members and their subjects.

In this sense, liberty is the perfection of civil society. But still, authority is essential to its very existence.

Authority might challenge liberty because of the constant disputes that it creates.

This can be done when the authority to preserve society challenged by <!-- is more essential than --> the liberty which only adds to the perfection of government.

<!-- Unless perhaps one may say with some reason that a circumstance, which is essential to the existence of civil society, must always support itself, and needs be guarded with less jealousy, than one that contributes only to its perfection, which the indolence of men is so apt to neglect, or their ignorance to overlook. -->
