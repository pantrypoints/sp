You and all speculative sceptics have a doctrine that are at variance in:
- the most abstruse points of theory
- the conduct of common life

Wherever you find evidence, you adhere to it despite your pretended scepticism.

<!-- Some of your sect are as decisive as those who make greater professions of certainty and assurance.  -->

It is ridiculous to:
- reject NEWTON's explanation of the rainbow just because it gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light which is too refined for human comprehension.
- reject the arguments of COPERNICUS and GALILEO for the motion of the earth just because these subjects were too magnificent to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of mankind.

A brutish and ignorant scepticism:
- gives the vulgar a prejudice against what they do not easily understand
- makes them reject every principle which requires elaborate reasoning

This species of scepticism is fatal to knowledge, not to religion.

Those who make greatest profession of it give often their assent to:
- the great truths of Theism and natural theology
- the most absurd tenets from traditional superstition

They firmly believe in witches, though they will not believe nor attend to the most simple proposition of Euclid. 

But the refined and philosophical sceptics fall into an inconsistence of an opposite nature. 

They push their researches into the most abstruse corners of science.

Their assent attends them in every step, proportioned to the evidence which they meet with. 

They are even obliged to acknowledge, that the most abstruse and remote objects are those which are best explained by philosophy. Light is in reality anatomised. The true system of the heavenly bodies is discovered and ascertained. 

But the nourishment of bodies by food is still an inexplicable mystery. 

The cohesion of the parts of matter is still incomprehensible. 

These sceptics, therefore, are obliged, in every question, to consider each particular evidence apart, and proportion their assent to the precise degree of evidence which occurs.

This is their practice in all natural, mathematical, moral, and political science. 

Why not the same in the theological and religious?

Why must conclusions of this nature be alone rejected on the general presumption of the insufficiency of human reason, without any particular discussion of the evidence? Is not such an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice and passion?

<!-- , even of the most familiar objects, extension, duration, motion, -->
You say that:
- our senses are fallacious
- our understanding is erroneous
- our ideas are full of absurdities and contradictions

You defy me to solve the difficulties, or reconcile the repugnancies which you discover in them. I have not capacity for so great an undertaking: I have not leisure for it: 

I perceive it to be superfluous. 

Your own conduct, in every circumstance, refutes your principles, and shows the firmest reliance on all the received maxims of science, morals, prudence, and behaviour.

I shall never assent to so harsh an opinion as that of a celebrated writer [L'Arte de penser], who says, that the Sceptics are not a sect of philosophers: They are only a sect of liars.

I may, however, affirm (I hope without offence), that they are a sect of jesters or raillers. But for my part, whenever I find myself disposed to mirth and amusement, I shall certainly choose my entertainment of a less perplexing and abstruse nature. A comedy, a novel, or at most a history, seems a more natural recreation than such metaphysical subtleties and abstractions.

In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between science and common life, or between one science and another. The arguments employed in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and contain the same force and evidence. Or if there be any difference among them, the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and natural religion. Many principles of mechanics are founded on very abstruse reasoning; yet no man who has any pretensions to science, even no speculative sceptic, pretends to entertain the least doubt with regard to them.

The COPERNICAN system contains the most surprising paradox, and the most contrary to our natural conceptions, to appearances, and to our very senses: yet even monks and inquisitors are now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it. 

Shall PHILO, a man of so liberal a genius and extensive knowledge, entertain any general undistinguished scruples with regard to the religious hypothesis, which is founded on the simplest and most obvious arguments, and, unless it meets with artificial obstacles, has such easy access and admission into the mind of man?

After the union of philosophy with the popular religion, upon the first establishment of Christianity, nothing was more usual, among all religious teachers, than declamations against reason, against the senses, against every principle derived merely from human research and inquiry. 

All the topics of the ancient academics were adopted by the fathers; and thence propagated for several ages in every school and pulpit throughout Christendom. 

- The Reformers embraced the same principles of reasoning.
- All panegyrics on the excellency of faith, were sure to be interlarded with some severe strokes of satire against natural reason. 

A celebrated prelate [Monsr. Huet] too, of the Romish communion, a man of the most extensive learning, who wrote a demonstration of Christianity, has also composed a treatise, which contains all the cavils of the boldest and most determined PYRRHONISM. 

LOCKE was the first Christian to assert that:
- faith was but a species of reason
- religion was only a branch of philosophy
- a chain of arguments, similar to that which established any truth in morals, politics, or physics, was always employed in discovering all the principles of theology, natural and revealed. 

The ill use which BAYLE and other libertines made of the philosophical scepticism of the fathers and first reformers, still further propagated the judicious sentiment of Mr. LOCKE: And it is now in a manner avowed, by all pretenders to reasoning and philosophy, that Atheist and Sceptic are almost synonymous. 

No man is in earnest when he professes the latter principle, I would fain hope that there are as few who seriously maintain the former.

LORD BACON has already addressed this. A little philosophy makes a man an Atheist. A lot of philosophy converts him to religion. 

Bacon mentions DAVID's fool, who said in his heart there is no God. Bacon observes that the Atheists nowadays have a double share of folly:

1. They are not contented to say in their hearts there is no God.
2. They also utter that impiety with their lips, and are thereby guilty of multiplied indiscretion and imprudence. 

Such people cannot be very formidable.

But though you should rank me in this class of fools, I cannot forbear communicating a remark that occurs to me, from the history of the religious and irreligious scepticism with which you have entertained us. It appears to me, that there are strong symptoms of priestcraft in the whole progress of this affair.

During ignorant ages, such as those which followed the dissolution of the ancient schools, the priests perceived, that Atheism, Deism, or heresy of any kind, could only proceed from the presumptuous questioning of received opinions, and from a belief that human reason was equal to every thing. 

Education had then a mighty influence over the minds of men, and was almost equal in force to those suggestions of the senses and common understanding, by which the most determined sceptic must allow himself to be governed.

But at present, when the influence of education is much diminished, and men, from a more open commerce of the world, have learned to compare the popular principles of different nations and ages, our sagacious divines have changed their whole system of philosophy, and talk the language of STOICS, PLATONISTS, and PERIPATETICS, not that of PYRRHONIANS and ACADEMICS. 

If we distrust human reason, we have now no other principle to lead us into religion. Thus, sceptics in one age, dogmatists in another; whichever system best suits the purpose of these reverend gentlemen, in giving them an ascendant over mankind, they are sure to make it their favourite principle, and established tenet.

Men naturally embrace those principles, by which they find they can best defend their doctrines; nor need we have any recourse to priestcraft to account for so reasonable an expedient. 

Surely nothing can afford a stronger presumption, that any set of principles are true, and ought to be embraced, than to observe that they tend to the confirmation of true religion, and serve to confound the cavils of Atheists, Libertines, and Freethinkers of all denominations.
