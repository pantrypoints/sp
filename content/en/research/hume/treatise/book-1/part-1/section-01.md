## All Simple Ideas Initially Come from Simple Impressions as Sensory Perceptions and Feelings

All our perceptions are either impressions or ideas.

Their difference is in how their force strikes the mind.

<!-- enter into our consciousness. -->

'Impressions' are perceptions which enter with most force and violence.
- This includes all our sensations and feelings.

 <!-- as they first appear to the soul. -->


'Ideas' are the faint images of impressions in the process of thinking. This includes all the perceptions except:
- those from the sight and touch, and
- the immediate sensation from sight and touch.

 <!-- pleasure or uneasiness caused by those perceptions from  -->

Feeling and thinking sometimes seem like the same thing.

Our ideas may seem like our impressions when we:
- have dreams
- have fever
- have madness or violent emotions

Sometimes, our impressions are so faint and low that we cannot distinguish them from our ideas.

<!-- Despite their near resemblance, they are generally very different. -->

No one classifies each of them. 

<!--  can make a scruple to:
- rank them under distinct heads, and
- assign a name to each to mark the difference* -->

{{< f f="I use 'impression' and 'idea' in a different sense from the usual. I am restoring the word 'idea' to its original sense from which John Locke had perverted it. He made it stand for all our perceptions. 'Impression' does not mean how our lively perceptions are produced in the soul. It merely means the perceptions themselves. " >}}


## Simple and Complex Perceptions

Our perceptions are either:

1. Simple

These are impressions and ideas that are distinct and cannot be separated.

2. Complex

These can be separated into parts.

![Apples](/photos/objects/apples2.jpg)

This apple has colour, taste, and smell.
- These 3 are distinguishable from each other.

Our impressions and ideas always correspond to each other, and are similar except in their force and vivacity.

The one reflects the other. This makes all the perceptions of the mind:
- become double, and
- appear both as impressions and ideas.

I close my eyes and think of my room.
- The ideas I form are exact representations of the impressions that I felt. 
- What is in my ideas is also found in my impressions.
<!-- There is nothing in the one that is not found in the other. -->

<!-- In running over my other perceptions, I still find the same resemblance and representation.

Ideas and impressions always appear to correspond to each other. To me, this seems remarkable. -->

<!-- After a more accurate survey, I find that:
- I have been carried away too far by the first appearance. -->

<!-- - I must distinguish simple and complex perceptions to limit the general opinion that all our ideas and impressions resemble. -->


But I realize that:
- many of our ideas never had matching impressions
  - These are complex ideas
- many of our impressions never are exactly copied into ideas.
  - These are complex impressions

I can imagine a city called 'New Jerusalem', with gold pavements and ruby walls even if I never saw it.

I have seen Paris.
- But I can never recreate an idea of all of Paris with all its streets and houses.


As a general rule, our complex impressions and ideas resemble greatly.
- But they are not exact copies of each other.

On the other hand, the rule on simple perceptions has no exception.
- Every simple idea has a resembling simple impression.
- Every simple impression has a correspondent idea.

Our idea of red and the actual red that we see differ only in degree, not in nature.

<!-- It is impossible to prove that the case is the same with all our simple impressions and ideas by enumerating them.
- Everyone can run over as many as he pleases.

But if anyone denies this universal resemblance, I do not know how to convince him, but by asking him to show:
- a simple impression that has no correspondent idea, or
- a simple idea, that has no correspondent impression.

He cannot answer this.
- We may establish our conclusion from his silence and our own observation.
-->

Thus, all simple ideas and impressions resemble each other.
