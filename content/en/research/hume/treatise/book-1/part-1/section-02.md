## Impressions are Feelings or Sensory Perceptions, Ideas are Thoughts

We should examine our impressions before we accept our ideas, since:
- our simple impressions are prior to their correspondent ideas, and
- exceptions to this pattern are very rare.


There are 2 kinds of impressions:

1. Sensation

This arises in the soul originally, from unknown causes.

2. Reflection

This is derived mostly from our ideas, in the following sequence:

- 1. An impression first strikes the senses.

It makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain.

- 2.  A copy of this impression is taken by the mind.

This copy remains after the impression ceases. **We call this copy an idea.**

- 3. When this idea of pleasure or pain returns on the soul, it produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear.

I call these as 'impressions of reflection' [ resulting feelings ], because they are derived from this idea.

- 4. These again are copied by the memory and imagination, and become ideas.

- 5. These ideas lead to other impressions and ideas.

In this way, the impressions of reflection:
- come before their correspondent ideas, but after the ideas of sensation, and
- are derived from the ideas of sensation.

<!-- The examination of our sensations belongs more to scientists than to moral philosophers.

We therefore shall not enter it presently. -->


I will focus on the impressions of reflection called passions, desires, and emotions.
- These arise mostly from ideas.

<!-- It will thus be necessary to reverse that method which seems most natural at first sight. -->

To explain the nature and principles of the human mind, I will give an account of ideas before we proceed to impressions.
