To understand all the passions which have any mixture of love or hatred, only respect, contempt, and the amorous affection remain to be explained.
 
When we consider the qualities and circumstances of others, we may:
        ◦ regard them as they really are in themselves
        ◦ compare them and our own qualities and circumstances, or
        ◦ join these two methods.

From the first point of view, the good qualities of others produce love.
        ◦ From the second point of view, humility
        ◦ From the third, respect.
            ▪ Respect is a mixture of these two passions.

The bad qualities of others cause hatred, pride, or contempt, according to how we view them.
 
There is a mixture of:
- pride in contempt
- humility in respect

This mixture arises from a tacit comparison of the person contemned or respected with ourselves.
        ◦ The same man may cause respect, love, or contempt by his condition and talents, according to how equal or superior he is to the person who considers him.

In changing the point of view, the object may remain the same.
        ◦ Its proportion to ourselves entirely alters.
        ◦ This is the cause of an alteration in the passions.

Therefore, these passions arise from our observing the proportion; that is, from a comparison.
 
    • The mind has a much stronger propensity to pride than to humility.
    • I have endeavoured to assign a cause for this phenomenon, from the principles of human nature.
        ◦ This phenomenon:
            ▪ is undisputed
            ▪ appears in many instances
            ▪ is why:
                • there is a much greater mixture of pride in contempt, than of humility in respect.
                • we are more elevated with the view of one below us, than mortified by one above us.
    • Contempt or scorn has so strong a tincture of pride, that there is no other passion discernable.
        ◦ Whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility.
    • Vanity is so prompt, that it rouses at the least call.
        ◦ Humility requires a stronger impulse to make it exert itself.
 
    • Why does this mixture happen only in some cases?
    • All those objects which cause love when placed on another person, are the causes of:
        ◦ pride when transferred to ourselves
        ◦ humility and love consequently, while they:
            ▪ belong to others
            ▪ are only compared to those which we have ourselves.
    • In a like manner, every quality which produces hatred directly, should always cause pride by comparison.
        ◦ By a mixture of hatred and pride, those qualities should excite contempt or scorn.
    • Why:
        ◦ do objects ever cause pure love or hatred
        ◦ don’t objects always produce the mixed passions of respect and contempt?
 
    • Love and pride, humility and hatred are similar in their sensations.
        ◦ Love and pride are always agreeable.
        ◦ Humility and hatred are always painful.
    • This be universally true.
        ◦ But they have some differences, and even contrarieties, which distinguish them.
    • Pride and vanity most invigorates and exalts the mind.
        ◦ Love or tenderness weakens and enfeebles it.
    • The same difference is observable between the uneasy passions.
        ◦ Anger and hatred bestow a new force on all our thoughts and actions.
        ◦ Humility and shame deject and discourage us.
    • We need to form a distinct idea of these qualities of the passions.
        ◦ Let us remember that:
            ▪ pride and hatred invigorate the soul
            ▪ love and humility enfeeble it.
 
    • It follows that the conformity between love and hatred in the agreeableness of their sensation always makes them excited by the same objects.
        ◦ Yet this other contrariety is why they are excited in very different degrees.
    • Genius and learning are pleasant and magnificent objects.
        ◦ They are adapted to pride and vanity.
        ◦ But they have a relation to love by their pleasure only.
    • Ignorance and simplicity are disagreeable and mean.
        ◦ This gives them:
            ▪ a double connection with humility
            ▪ a single connection with hatred.
    • Therefore, the same object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, according to its different situations.
        ◦ But it seldom produces either of them in the same proportion.
 
    • We must seek a solution as to why any object:
        ◦ ever excites pure love or hatred
        ◦ does not always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride.
    • No quality in another gives rise to humility by comparison, unless it produced pride by being placed in ourselves.
        ◦ Vice versa, no object excites pride by comparison, unless it produced humility by the direct survey.
    • Objects always produce a sensation directly contrary to their original one, by comparison.
        ◦ Suppose an object, which produces love but imperfectly excites pride, is presented.
        ◦ This object directly causes a great degree of love since it belongs to another
            ▪ It causes a small degree of humility by comparison.
            ▪ Consequently, humility is scarce felt.
            ▪ It is unable to convert the love into respect.
    • This is the case with good nature, good humour, facility, generosity, beauty, and many other qualities in other people.
        ◦ These can produce love in others.
            ▪ But they do not excite so much pride in ourselves.
    • This is why they produce pure love with a small mix of humility and respect, when belonging to another person.
        ◦ The same reasoning can be easily extended to the opposite passions.
 
    • Before we leave this subject, it may not be amiss to account for a pretty curious phenomenon, viz, why we commonly keep the people we contemn at a distance and do not allow our inferiors to approach too near in place and situation.
    • Almost every kind of idea is attended with some emotion and fix our attention.
        ◦ For example:
            ▪ the ideas of number and extension
            ▪ important objects in life.
    • We cannot survey a rich or a poor man with total indifference.
        ◦ We must feel some faint touches of:
            ▪ respect in the rich man
            ▪ contempt in the poor man.
        ◦ These two passions are contrary to each other.
        ◦ To make this contrariety felt, the objects must be related in some way.
        ◦ Otherwise, the affections:
            ▪ are totally separate and distinct
            ▪ never encounter.
    • The relation takes place wherever the persons become contiguous.
        ◦ This is a general reason why we are uneasy at seeing such disproportioned objects, as a rich man and a poor one, a nobleman and a porter, in that situation.
 
    • This uneasiness is common to every spectator.
        ◦ It must be more sensible to the superior, because the inferior’s near approach:
            ▪ is regarded as a piece of ill-breeding
            ▪ shows that he is not:
                • sensible of the disproportion
                • affected by it.
    • A sense of superiority in another:
        ◦ breeds an inclination in all men to keep themselves at a distance from him
        ◦ determines them to redouble the marks of respect and reverence, when they are obliged to approach him.
    • and where they do not observe that conduct, it is a proof they are not sensible of his superiority.
    • From here too it proceeds, that any great difference in the degrees of any quality is called a distance by a common metaphor.
        ◦ It is, however, founded on natural principles of the imagination.
    • A great difference inclines us to produce a distance.
        ◦ Therefore, the ideas of distance and difference are connected together.
    • Connected ideas are readily taken for each other; and this is in general the source of the metaphor, as we shall have occasion to observe afterwards.
