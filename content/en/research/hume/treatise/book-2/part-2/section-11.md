The love between the man and woman, most deserves our attention of all the compound passions arising from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections, because of:
- its force and violence
- those curious principles of philosophy behind it.

In its most natural state, this love is derived from the conjunction of three different impressions or passions:
- the pleasing sensation arising from beauty
- the bodily appetite for generation
- a generous kindness or goodwill.

The origin of kindness from beauty is explained from the foregoing reasoning.
        ◦ The question is how the bodily appetite is excited by it.

The appetite of generation, when confined to a certain degree:
        ◦ is of the pleasant kind
        ◦ has a strong connection with all the agreeable emotions.

The following all encourage this desire:
- Joy, mirth, vanity, and kindness
- music, dancing, wine, and good cheer.

On the other hand, sorrow, melancholy, poverty, humility destroy it.
    • From this quality, it is easily conceived why it should be connected with the sense of beauty.

    • But there is another principle that contributes to the same effect.
    • The parallel direction of the desires is:
        ◦ a real relation
        ◦ produces a connection among them, no less than a resemblance in their sensation.

To fully comprehend the extent of this relation, we must consider that any principal desire may be attended with subordinate ones connected with it.
        ◦ If other subordinate desires are parallel, they are related to the principal one by that means.

Thus, hunger may often be considered as the soul’s primary inclination.
        ◦ The desire of approaching the meat is the secondary one.
        ◦ Since it is absolutely necessary to satisfy that appetite.
    • Therefore, if an object inclines us to approach the meat, it naturally increases our appetite.
        ◦ On the contrary, whatever inclines us to set our victuals at a distance:
            ▪ is contradictory to hunger
            ▪ reduces our inclination to them.

Beauty has the first effect, and deformity the second effect.
        ◦ This is why:
            ▪  beauty gives us a keener appetite for our victuals
            ▪ deformity is sufficient to disgust us at the most savoury dish.
    • All this is easily applicable to the appetite for generation.

    • From these two relations (resemblance and a parallel desire), a connection arises between:
        ◦ the sense of beauty
        ◦ the bodily appetite
        ◦ benevolence
    • These three become inseparable:
        ◦ It is indifferent which of them advances first.
        ◦ Since any of them is almost sure to be attended with the related affections.
    • A man inflamed with lust, at least feels a momentary kindness towards its object or woman.
        ◦ At the same time, he fancies her more beautiful than ordinary.
    • There are as many who begin with kindness and esteem for the person’s wit and merit, and advance from that to the other passions.
    • But the most common species of love is that which:
        ◦ first arises from beauty
        ◦ afterwards diffuses itself into:
            ▪ kindness
            ▪ the bodily appetite.
    • Kindness or esteem, and the appetite to generation, are too remote to unite easily together.
        ◦ Kindness is perhaps the most refined passion of the soul.
        ◦ The appetite for generation is the most gross and vulgar.
    • The love of beauty:
        ◦ is placed in a just medium between them
        ◦ shares both their natures.
    • From there, it is so singularly fitted to produce both.


This account of love is not peculiar to my system.
        ◦ But it is unavoidable on any hypothesis.
    • Its three affections are distinct.
        ◦ Each of them has its distinct object.

Therefore, they produce each other only by their relation.
        ◦ But the relation of passions alone is insufficient.
        ◦ There should also be a relation of ideas.
    • The beauty of one person never inspires us with love for another.
        ◦ This is a sensible proof of the double relation of impressions and ideas.
    • From this single evident instance, we may form a judgment of the rest.
    
    • This also illustrates the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred.
    • The self is the object of pride and humility.
    • Some other person is the object of love and hatred.
    • Yet these objects alone cannot be the causes of those passions.
        ◦ Since each of them has a relation to two contrary affections which must destroy each other at the very first moment.

The mind has certain organs naturally fitted to produce a passion which naturally turns the view to a certain object.
        ◦ But this is insufficient to produce the passion.
        ◦ Another emotion is required to:
            ▪ set these principles in action
            ▪ bestow on them their first impulse, through a double relation of impressions and ideas.

This situation is still more remarkable with regard to the appetite of generation.
        ◦ Sex is the object and the cause of the appetite.
    • We turn our view to it when actuated by that appetite.
        ◦ Reflecting on it suffices to excite the appetite.
    • But this cause loses its force by too great frequency.
        ◦ It needs to be quickened by some new impulse.
        ◦ We find that impulse to arise from the person’s beauty, that is, from a double relation of impressions and ideas.
    • This double relation is necessary where an affection has a distinct cause and object.
        ◦ How much more so is it necessary when it only has a distinct object, without any determinate cause?
