## The First Source Of Authority: Long Possession

Most established governments get their authority from the principle of long possession in any one form of government, or the succession of princes.

Almost all origins of every nation are founded on kings or forms of commonwealth founded on usurpation and rebellion.
            Their titles were initially doubtful and uncertain.

Time alone gives solidity to their right.
            It operates gradually on people's minds.
            It reconciles them to any authority and makes it seem just and reasonable.

Custom causes any sentiment to have a greater influence on us.
        It turns our imagination more strongly to any object.

When we have been long accustomed to obey any set of persons, we have a general tendency to suppose a moral obligation attending loyalty.
        This tendency takes us
            easily to this direction, and
            chooses that set of men for its objects.

Interest gives us the general instinct.

But custom gives us the particular direction.

The same length of time has a different influence on our moral sentiments, according to its different influence on the mind.

We naturally judge of everything by comparison.
        We embrace a long span of time in considering the fate of kingdoms and republics.
        In this case, a small span does not have a like influence on our sentiments.

One thinks he acquires a right to a horse or a suit of clothes, in a very short time.
        But a century is insufficient to:
            establish any new government, or
            remove all scruples in the subjects' minds on it.

A shorter span of time will give a prince a title to any power he may usurp.
        But it will not fix his right to that power.
        The French kings did not have absolute power for over two reigns.
            Yet nothing will appear more extravagant to the French than to talk of their liberties.
        This phenomenon is accounted for by what I have said on accession.


## The Second Source Of Authority: Present Possession

When there is no form of government established by long possession, the present possession:
- is sufficient to supply its place, and
- may be regarded as the second source of all public authority.

Right to authority is nothing but the constant possession of authority.
        It is maintained by the laws of society and mankind's interests.
        It is most natural to join this constant possession to the present one, according to the above-mentioned principles.

If the same principles did not take place with regard to private property, it was because these principles were counter-balanced by very strong interests.
        In such cases, interest prevented all restitution and authorized every violence.

The same motives may seem to have force with regard to public authority.
        Yet they are opposed by a contrary interest which consists in:
            preserving peace, and
            avoiding all changes which are attended with bloodshed and confusion in the public affairs, but may be easily produced in private affairs.

Anyone who cannot account for the right of the present possessor by any system of ethics:
- should absolutely deny that right, and
- should assert that it is not authorized by morality.

People would think that such a person:
- maintains a very extravagant paradox, and
- shocks mankind's common sense and judgment.

No maxim is more conformable to prudence and morals, than to submit quietly to the government established in the country we happen to live, without inquiring too curiously into its origin and establishment.

Few governments will be examined so rigorously.

How many kingdoms are there in the world at present?

How many more do we find in history, whose governors have no better foundation for their authority than that of present possession?

The long succession of emperors from the dissolution of the Roman liberty to Rome's extinction by the Turks, could not pretend to any other title to the empire.

The election of the senate was a mere form.
        It always followed the choice of the legions.

These were almost always divided in the different provinces.
            Only the sword was able to terminate the difference.
            Therefore, every emperor acquired and defended his right by the sword.

We must either say that:
- for so many ages, the world had no government and owed allegiance to no one, or
- in public affairs, the right of the stronger is legitimate and authorized by morality, when not opposed by any other title.


## The Third Source of Authority: Right Of Conquest

The right of conquest may be a third source of the title of sovereigns.
        This right resembles very much the right of present possession.
        But it has a superior force.
            It is seconded by the notions of glory and honour which attend conquerors, instead of hatred and detestation which attend usurpers.

Men naturally favour those they love.

Men therefore are more apt to ascribe a right to successful violence, between two sovereigns, than to the successful rebellion of a subject against his sovereign.23
