The Surrounding Sea covers most of Zone 7 in the north from the beginning to the middle of Section 5, where it touches the Qufaya Mountains that surround Gog and Magog.

### Sections 1 and 2

These are covered by water, except where England is located, most of which lies in the second section. 

In the first section, there is a corner of England which extends towards the north.The remainder, with a portion of the sea that encircles it, lies in the second section of the sixth zone. 

The channel connecting England with the mainland is twelve miles wide. Beyond the island of England, in the north of the second section, is the island of Raslandah oblong in shape, stretching lengthwise from west to east.

### Section 3

Most of this section is covered by water, except for an oblong portion in the south that is wider in its eastern part. Here, the land of Poland continues. 

In the western part of the portion of the sea covering this section, there lies a round, wide (island). It is connected with the mainland by an isthmus in the south, which leads to the land of Poland. North of it is the island of Norway, 204 oblong in shape, which stretches lengthwise from west to east in the north (of the section). 

### Section 4

This is entirely covered in the north by the Surrounding Sea from the western to the eastern (boundaries of the section). Its southern part is not covered by the sea. To the west, it contains the land of the Finland [?] 205 Turks. To the east lies the country of Tavast,206 followed by the land of Estonia [?] 207 extending to the eastern boundary of the section. 

(Estonia) is permanently covered by snow and has little civilization. It borders on the country of Russia in the fourth and fifth sections of the sixth zone.

### Section 5

This contains in the west the country of Russia. In the north, (Russia) 207a extends to where the portion of the Surrounding Sea and the Qufaya Mountains meet, as we have mentioned before. 

The eastern region of the section contains the continuation of the land of the Comans, which lies on (the shore of) a portion of the Black Sea in the sixth section of the sixth zone. It reaches the Lake of T-r-m-y 208
in this section. 

This is a fresh-water lake into which drain many rivers from the mountains south and north of it. In the northeast of this section is the land of the Nabariyah 209 Turks, which extends to the boundary of the section.

### Section 6

This contains in the southwest the continuation of the land of the Comans. In the middle of that region is Lake Gh-n-w-n. 210 This is a fresh-water lake into which drain the rivers from the mountains in the regions east of it. 

It is constantly frozen because of the severe cold, except for a short while during the summer. East of the country of the Comans is the country of Russia, which started in the northeast of the fifth section of the sixth zone. In the southeast corner of this (the sixth) section, is the remainder of the land of the Bulgars (Bulghar) that started in the northeastern part of the sixth section of the sixth zone. In the middle of this portion of the land of the Bulgars, there is the point where the Volga makes its first turn to the south, as has been mentioned. 

The Qufaya Mountains stretch all along the northern boundary of the sixth section from the west to the east.

### Section 7

This, in the west, contains the remainder of the land of the Pechenegs, a Turkish nation. 

Beginning in the northeastern part of the preceding sixth and southwest of this section, it then, in the south, enters the sixth zone. In the east, there is the remainder of the land of the Bashqirs, followed by the remainder of the Stinking Land, which extends to the eastern boundary of the section. 

The northern boundary of the section is formed by the surrounding Qufaya Mountains stretching (all along it) from the west to the east. 

### Section 8

This contains in the southwest the continuation of the Stinking Land. East of it is the Sunken 211 Land, a remarkable place. It is an immense opening in the earth, so deep that the bottom cannot be reached. The appearance of smoke during the day and of fire at night, which by turns flares up and disappears, leads to the conclusion that the place is inhabited. A river is occasionally seen there. It cuts through itfrom south to north. In the east of this section is the Waste Country, which borders the Dam. 

Across the northern limit of the section are the Qufaya Mountains, stretching all along it from the west to the east. 

### Section 9

This contains in the west the country of the Khifshakh, that is, the Qipchaqs. It is traversed by the Qufaya Mountains where they turn away from the north (of the section) at the Surrounding Sea and run southeast through the middle (of the section). 

They then leave (this zone) for the ninth section of the sixth zone and pass across it. There, in the middle of them, is the Dam of Gog and Magog, which we have already mentioned. The eastern part of this section contains the land of Magog, behind the Qufaya Mountains, on the sea. It 211a is not very wide and is oblong in shape and surrounds it in the east and north.

### Section 10

This is is entirely covered by the sea.
