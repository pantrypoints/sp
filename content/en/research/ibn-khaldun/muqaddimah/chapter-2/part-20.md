<!-- description= "As long as a nation retains its group feeling, royal authority that disappears in one branch will, of necessity, pass to some other branch of the same nation" -->

<!-- ## 20. While a nation is savage, its royal authority extends farther. -->

This is because a savage nation is more able to achieve superiority and full control, and to subdue other groups. 

The members of such a nation have the strength to fight other nations, and they are like what beasts of prey are among dumb animals. 

The Arabs and the Zanatah and similar groups, for instance, are such nations, as are the Kurds, the Turkomans, and the Veiled Sinhajah.

These savage peoples:
- have no homelands to use as fertile pasture
- have no fixed place to repair. 

All regions and places are the same to them. Therefore, they do not:
- restrict themselves to possession of their own and neighboring regions
- stop at the borders of their horizon. 

They swarm across distant zones and achieve superiority over faraway nations.

Umar said the following when he received the oath of allegiance and incited the people to conquer Iraq. 

{{< q >}}
The Hijaz is your home only in as far as it is a pasturage. 

Those who dwell there have no power over it except in this respect. Where do you newcomers who emigrated to Medina stand with regard to God's promise, 'Travel about in the world'? 124 God promised it to you in His book for your inheritance, when He said, 'In order to give (the true religion) victory over all religions, even if the polytheists dislike it.' " 125

Another example is the condition of the ancient pre-Islamic Arabs, such as the Tubba's and the Himyar. 

They [126] marched:
- from the Yemen to the Maghrib at one time, and
- to the 'Iraq and India at another time. 

Only the Arabs ever did anything like that.

The condition of the Veiled (Sinhajah) in the Maghrib is another example. 

When they aspired to royal authority, they swarmed out of their desert plains in the neighborhood of the Sudan, in the first zone, and overran the Spanish realm in the fourth and fifth zones, without any intermediate (stage).

The dynasties of savage nations, therefore, extend over a wider area and over regions farther from their original center<!--  (than do other nations) -->.
