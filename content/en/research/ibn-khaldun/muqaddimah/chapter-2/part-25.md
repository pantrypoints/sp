## 24. Arabs can gain control only over flat territory

This is because of their savage nature. They are people who plunder and cause damage. <!-- They plunder whatever they are able to lay their hands on without having to fight or to expose themselves to danger. --> They then retreat to their pastures in the desert. They do not attack or fight except in self-defense.

They bypass every stronghold or locality that is difficult to attack, in favor of an easier enterprise.

Tribes that are protected against the Arabs by inaccessible mountains are safe from their mischief and destructiveness.

The Arabs would not cross hills or undergo hardship and danger in order to get to them.

Flat territory, on the other hand, falls victim to their looting and prey to their appetite whenever they have the opportunity of gaining power over it, when:
- there is no militia, or
- the dynasty is weak. 

Then they raid, plunder, and attack that territory repeatedly because it is easily accessible to them.

Eventually, its inhabitants succumb utterly to the Arabs. Then they are pushed around by the Arabs with changes of control and shifts in leadership.

Eventually, their civilization is wiped out. 

<!-- God has power over His creatures. -->


## 25. Places that succumb to the Arabs are quickly ruined

This is because the Arabs are a savage nation. They enjoy savagery because it means freedom from authority<!--  and no subservience to leadership -->. Such a natural disposition negates <!-- is the negation and antithesis of --> civilization. 

All the customary activities of the Arabs lead to travel and movement. This <!-- is the antithesis and --> negates the stationariness which produces civilization. 

For instance, the Arabs need stones as supports for their cooking pots. They tear down buildings to get those stones. <!-- , and use them for that purpose. --> 

They also need wood for props and poles for their tents. <!--  and for use as tent poles for their dwellings. --> So they tear down roofs to get that wood. 

The very nature of their existence negates building which is the basis of civilization. <!-- This is the case with them quite generally. -->

Furthermore, it is their nature to plunder other people as the source of their sustenance. <!-- lies wherever the shadow of their lances falls. --> They recognize no limit in taking the possessions of other people. Whenever their eyes fall upon some property, furnishings, or utensils, they take it. When they acquire superiority and royal authority, they have complete power to plunder as they please. 

This removes any political power to protect property, and so, civilization is ruined.

They force craftsmen and professional workers to work for them without pay. <!-- do their work, they do not see any value in it and do not pay them for it. -->


**Labor is the real basis of profit.** 

When labor is not appreciated and is done for nothing, the hope for profit vanishes, and no productive work is done. This causes the sedentary population to disperse and the civilization to decay.

Furthermore, the Arabs are not concerned with laws. They are not concerned to deter people from misdeeds or to protect some against the others. 

They care only for the property that they can take away through looting and imposts. When they have obtained that, they have no interest in anything further, such as:
- taking care of people
- looking after their interests, or
- forcing them not to commit misdeeds.

They often level fines on property because they want to get some advantage, some tax, or profit out of it. 
- This is their custom.

It does not help to prevent misdeeds or to deter those who undertake to commit misdeeds. 

On the contrary, it increases misdeeds because as compared to getting what one wants, the possible financial loss through fines is insignificant.

Under Arab rule, the subjects live as in a state of anarchy, without law.

Anarchy destroys mankind and ruins civilization, since the existence of royal authority is a natural quality of man.

Royal authority alone guarantees their existence and social organization. 

<!-- That was mentioned above at the beginning of the chapter. 142 -->

Every Arab is eager to be the leader. 

Scarcely a one of them would cede his power to another, even to his father, his brother, or the eldest most important member of his family. 

That happens only in rare cases and underpressure of considerations of decency. 

There are many authorities and amirs among them.

The subjects have to obey many masters in connection with the control of taxation and law. Civilization, thus, decays and is wiped out. 

'Abd-al-Malik asked one Arab who had come to him on an embassy about al-Hajjaj.

He wanted him to praise alHajjaj for his good political leadership for the benefit of civilization. 

But the Arab said: "When I left him, he was acting unjustly all by himself."

<!-- 142a -->


The civilizations that the Arabs took over and conquered always collapsed.
- Such settlements were depopulated.
- The very earth there turned into something that was no longer earth. 

The Yemen where the Arabs live is in ruins, except for a few cities. 
- Persian civilization in the Arab 'Iraq is likewise completely ruined.
- The same applies to contemporary Syria. 

When the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym pushed through from their homeland to Ifrigiyah and the Maghrib in the beginning of the 11th century. 
- They struggled there for 350 years and attached themselves to the country.
- The flat territory in the Maghrib was completely ruined.

Formerly, the whole region between the Sudan and the Mediterranean had been settled. 

This is attested by the relics of civilization there, such as:
- monuments
- architectural sculpture
- the visible remains of villages and hamlets.
