Examples are judges, muftis, teachers, prayer leaders, preachers, muezzins.

This is because profit is the value realized from labor. This value differs according to the need for labor. 

Certain types of labor may be necessary. Their value is greater. The need for them more urgent.

The common people have no compelling need for religious services. They are needed only by the religious. Even if the offices of mufti and judge are needed in case of disputes, it is not a compelling and general need.

Mostly, they can be dispensed with. 

Only the ruler is concerned with religious officials and institutions, as part of his duty to look after the public interests. 
- He assigns the religious officials a share of sustenance proportionate to the need that exists for them in the sense (just) mentioned. 
- He does not place them on an equal footing with people who have power or with people who ply the necessary crafts, even if the things that (the religious officials) have to offer are nobler, as they deal with religion and the legal institutions. 

He gives them their share in accordance with the general need and the demand of the population (for them). Their portion,
therefore, can only be small. 

Furthermore, because the things (the religious officials) have to offer are so noble, they feel superior to the people and are proud of themselves.

Therefore, they are not obsequious to persons of rank, in order to obtain something to improve their sustenance. 

In fact, they would not have time for that.

They are occupied with those noble things they have to offer and which tax both the mind and the body. The noble character of the things they have to offer does not permit them to prostitute themselves openly. They would not do such a thing. As a consequence, they do not, as a rule, become very wealthy.

I discussed this with an excellent man who disagreed with me. But some stray leaves from the account books of the government offices in the palace of al-Ma'mun came into my hand. 
- They gave information about income and expenditures at that time. 

I noticed the salaries of judges, prayer leaders, and muezzins. I called the attention of the person mentioned to it. He realized that I was correct. 

He became a convert to my opinion. We were both astonished at the secret ways of God<!--  with regard to His creation and His wise (planning) concerning His worlds. -->.


## 8. Agriculture is Livelihood For Weak People

This is because agriculture is a natural and simple procedure.

Sedentary people, or people who live in luxury, do not practice it. Those who practice are humble. 

When Muhammad saw a plowshare in one of the houses of the Ansar (in Medina). He said: "Such a thing never entered anyone's house save accompanied by humbleness."

Al-Bukhari explained this (statement) as referring to too intense an occupation with (agriculture) and he entitled the chapter in which he dealt with the tradition in question= "Warning against the consequences of (too intensive an) occupation with agricultural implements or transgression of the stipulated limit." 

However, Mohammad said it because imposts are exacted from farmers and lead to their domination by others. 

The person who has to pay imposts is humble and poor, because a superior force takes his possessions away.

{{< q a="Mohammad" >}}
The Hour will not arise until the charity tax becomes an impost.
{{< /q >}}

This refers to the unjust tyrannical ruler who forgets the divine rights of private capital and considers all rights to be subject to imposts.
