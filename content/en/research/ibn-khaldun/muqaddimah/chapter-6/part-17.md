This belongs to the sciences of the religious law. It originated in Islam when the sciences became crafts 553 and scholars wrote books on them. 

Dream visions and dream interpretation existed among the ancients, as among later generations. It existed among former (pre-Islamic) religious groups and nations. However, their dream interpretation did not reach us, 554 because we have been
satisfied with the discussions of Muslim dream interpreters. 

In any case, all human beings can have dream visions, and these visions must be interpreted.

Truthful Joseph already interpreted visions, as is mentioned in the Qur'an. 555

Sound tradition in) the Sahih, on the authority of the Prophet and on the authority of Abu Bakr, likewise establishes (the existence of dream visions). Dream vision is a kind of supernatural perception. Muhammad said= "A good dream vision is the 46th part of prophecy." <!-- 556 --> 

He also said: "The only remaining bearer of glad tidings is a good dream vision, beheld by - or shown to - a good man." <!-- 557  -->

The revelation given to the Prophet began with a dream vision. Every dream vision he saw appeared to him like the break of dawn. When Muhammad went away from the morning prayer, he used to ask the men around him, "Did any one of you see a
dream vision during the night?" He asked this question in order to derive good news from dream visions, which might refer to the victory of Islam and the growth of its power.558

The reason for perception of the supernatural in dream visions is as follows:
<!-- 559  -->

The spirit of the heart, which is the fine vapor coming from the cavity in the flesh of the heart, spreads into the veins and, through the blood, to all the rest of the body. It serves to perfect the actions and sensations of the animal powers. 

The spirit may be affected by lassitude, because it is very busy with the sensual
perception of the five senses and with the employment of the external powers. When
the surface of the body, then, is covered by the chill of night, the spirit withdraws
from all the other regions of the body to its center, the heart. It rests, in order to be
able to resume its activity, and all the external senses are (for the time being)
unemployed. This is the meaning of sleep, as was mentioned before at the beginning
of the book. 

The spirit of the heart is the vehicle of man's rational spirit.

Through its essence, the rational spirit perceives everything that is in the divine world, since its reality and its essence are identical with perception. It is prevented from assimilating any supernatural perception by the veil of its preoccupation with the body and the corporeal powers and senses. 

If it were without that veil or stripped of it, it would return to its reality, which is identical with perception. It would thus
be able to assimilate any object of perception. 

If it were stripped of part of it, its preoccupation would be less. It is thus able to catch a glimpse of its own world, since external sense perception, its greatest preoccupation, now occupies it less. Its (supernatural perception) corresponds (in intensity) to the degree to which the veil is withdrawn from it. 

Thus it becomes prepared to receive the available perceptions from its own world that are appropriate for it. When it has perceived these perceptions from its own worlds, it returns with them to its body, since, as long as it remains in its corporeal body, it cannot be active except through corporeal means ofperception.The faculties through which the body perceives knowledge are all connected with the brain. 

The active part among them is the imagination. It derives imaginary pictures from the pictures perceived by the senses and turns them over to the power of memory, which retains them until they are needed in connection with speculation and deduction. From the (imaginary pictures), the soul also abstracts other spiritual-intellectual pictures. 

In this way, abstraction ascends from the sensibilia to the intelligibilia. The imagination is the intermediary between them. Also, when the soul has received a certain number of perceptions from its own world, it passes them on to the imagination, which forms them into appropriate pictures and turns those perceptions over to the common sense.

As a result, the sleeper sees them as if they were perceived by the senses. Thus, the perceptions come down from the rational
spirit to the level of sensual perception, with the imagination again being the
intermediary. This is what dream visions actually are.

The (preceding) exposition shows the difference between true dream visions and false, "confused dreams." 

All of them are pictures in the imagination while an individual is asleep. However, if these pictures come down from the rational spirit that perceives (them), they are dream visions. But if they are derived from the pictures preserved in the power of memory, where the imagination deposits them when the individual is awake, they are "confused dreams." \

True dream visions have signs indicating their truthfulness and attesting their soundness, so that the person who has the dream vision becomes conscious of the glad tidings from God given him in his sleep.

The first of these signs is that the person who has the dream vision wakes up quickly, as soon as he has perceived it. It seems as if he is in a hurry to get back to being awake and having sensual perception. Were he (to continue) to sleep soundly, the perception given him would weigh heavily on him. 

Therefore, he tries to escape from the state (in which he has supernatural perception) to the state of sensual
perception in which the soul is always fully immersed in the body and the corporeal
accidents.

Another sign is that the dream vision stays and remains impressed with all its details in the memory of (the person who perceived it). Neither neglect nor forgetfulness affects it. 

No thinking or remembering is required, in order to have it present (to one's mind). The (dream vision) remains pictured in the mind of (the
dreamer) when he awakes. Nothing of it is lost to him. 

This is because perception by the soul does not take place in time and requires no consecutive order, but takes
place all at once and within a single time element. 562 

"Confused dreams" on the other hand, take place in time, because they:
- rest in the powers of the brain
- are brought from the power of memory to the common sense by the imagination.

The process is an action of the body. 

All actions of the body take place in time. Thus, they (require) a consecutive order, in order to perceive anything, with something coming first and something else coming later. 

Forgetfulness always affects the powers of the brain. It also affects them. That is not the case with the perceptions of the rational soul. They do not take place in time and have no consecutive order. 

Perceptions that are impressed in (the rational soul) are impressed
all at once in the briefest moment. 

Thus, after (the sleeper) is awake, (his) dream vision remains present in his memory for quite some time. In no way does it slip his mind as the result of neglect, if it originally made a strong impression. However, if it
requires thinking and application to remember a dream vision after a sleeper is
awake, and if he has forgotten many of its details before he can remember them
again, the dream vision is not a true one but a "confused dream."

These signs belong in particular to (prophetic) revelation. God said to HisProphet= "Do not set your tongue in motion to make haste with (the revelation of the Qur'an). It is up to us to put it together and to recite it. And when we recite it, follow
its recitation. 

Then, it is up to us to explain it." 563 Dream visions are related to prophecy and revelation, as is stated in (the sound tradition of) the Sahih. 

Thus, Muhammad said: "A dream vision is the forty-sixth part of prophecy." 564 In the same way, the characteristics of dream visions are related to the characteristics of prophecy. One should not consider that as unlikely. It appears to be this way.
God creates whatever He wishes to create.
