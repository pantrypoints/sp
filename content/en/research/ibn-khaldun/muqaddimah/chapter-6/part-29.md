This studies the substance through which gold and silver can be artificially generated. 

he alchemists acquire knowledge of the tempers and powers of all created things and investigate them critically. 

They hope to come upon the substance that is prepared to produce gold and silver. 

They even investigate the waste matter of animals, such as bones, feathers, hair, eggs, and excrements, and minerals.

 comments on the operations through which such a substance may be

Alchemy tries to transform the substance from potentiality into actuality through:
- the dissolution of bodies (substances) into their natural components through sublimation and distillation
- the solidification of meltable (substances) through calcification
- the pulverization of solid materials with the help of pestles and mullers and similar things. 

The alchemists assume that all these techniques lead to a natural substance called "the elixir." 

<!-- 958  -->

They prepare lead, tin, or copper in a way that closely approaches preparedness in actuality for receiving the form of gold or silver. Then they are heated in the fire and some quantity of the elixir is added to it, that substance turns into pure gold. 

<!-- 959 -->

<!-- In the technical terminology that the alchemists use for purposes of mystification,  -->

They call:
- the elixir as "spirit"
- the substance to which the elixir is added, as "body"

 
<!-- The science that comments on this technical terminology and on the form of the technical operation by which predisposed substances are turned into the form of gold and silver, is the science of alchemy. In both ancient and modern times, people
have written works on alchemy. Discussions of alchemy are occasionally ascribed to people who were not alchemists. -->

The chief systematic writer on alchemy, according to the alchemists, is Jabir b. Hayyan. They even call it "the science of Jabir."

 <!-- 960 -->
He wrote 70 treatises on alchemy. All of them read like puzzles. 

<!-- It is thought 961 that only those who know all that is in (Jabir's treatises) can unlock the secrets of alChemy. 962 963 -->

At-Tughra'i, a recent Eastern philosopher, wrote systematic works on alchemy and disputations with alchemists and other philosophers. 

Maslamah al-Majriti, a Spanish philosopher, wrote on alchemy the Rutbat al-hakim.

He wrote the Rutbah as a counterpart to his work on sorcery and talismans entitled Ghayat al-hakim. He thought that the two arts (alchemy and sorcery) were both results and fruits of philosophy and science, and that those who were not acquainted with them would miss the fruit of scholarship and philosophy altogether. 

<!-- 964 -->

Maslamah's discussion in the Rutbah and the discussions of all the alchemists in their respective works employ puzzling means of expression.

 <!-- which are difficult for those who- have not familiarized themselves with the technicalterminology of (alchemists), to understand.  -->

<!-- We shall mention the reason why the alchemists had recourse to these cover names and puzzling means of expression. 965  966-->


Ibn al-Mughayribi, a leading alchemist, has written alchemical maxims in verses the rhyme letter of which is each letter of the alphabet, taken up in turn.

The verses belong among the most original poetry there is. All of them employ a puzzling manner of expression, (and they are) like elusive riddles. They can hardly be understood.

Works on alchemy are attributed to al-Ghazzali. <!-- 967 --> 

But this attribution is incorrect because al-Ghazzali's lofty perceptions would not have permitted him to study, or, eventually, to adopt the errors of alchemical theories.

Some alchemical theories and opinions are occasionally attributed to Khalid b. Yazid b. Mu'awiyah. He was <!-- , 968 --> a stepson of Marwan b. al-Hakam. 

However, <!-- it is very well known that --> Khalid was an Arab by race and close to the Bedouin attitude. 
- Thus, he was not familiar with the sciences and crafts in general. 

<!-- How, then, could he have known an unusual craft based upon knowledge of the natures and tempers of composite things, when the physical and medical works of scholars who did research on those subjects had not yet appeared and had not yet been translated?  -->

The only possibility is that there existed another Khalid b. Yazid among persons versed in the various crafts, and that the mix-up was caused by identical names.
