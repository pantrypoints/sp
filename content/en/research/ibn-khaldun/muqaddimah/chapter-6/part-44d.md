Contemporary Easterners are more concerned with commenting on and teaching (the Miftah) than any other (work).

In general, the people of the East cultivate this discipline more than the Maghribis. 

The reason is perhaps that it is a luxury,1305 as far as the linguistic
sciences are concerned, and luxury crafts exist (only) where civilization is abundant,
and civilization is (today) more abundant in the East than in the West, as we havementioned.1306 Or, we might say (the reason is that) the non-Arabs (Persians) who constitute the majority of the population of the East occupy themselves with the
Qur'an commentary of az-Zamakhshari, which is wholly based upon this
discipline. 1307

The people of the West chose as their own field the (third) subdivision of this discipline, the science of rhetorical figures ('ilm al-badi'). They made it a part of poetical literature. They invented a detailed (nomenclature of rhetorical) figures
1308 for it and divided it into many chapters and subdivisions. They thought that they could consider all that part of the Arabic language. However, the reason (why they cultivated the subject) was that they liked to express themselves artistically.
(Furthermore,) the science of rhetorical figures is easy to learn, while it was difficult
for them to learn rhetoric and style, 1309 because the theories and ideas of (rhetoric
and style) are subtle and intricate. 

Therefore, they kept away from those two subjects. One of the authors in Ifrigiyah who wrote on rhetorical figures was Ibn
Rashiq. 1310 His Kitab al-'Umdah is famous. Many of the people of Ifriqiyah and
Spain wrote along the lines of (the 'Umdah).


The fruit of this discipline is understanding of the inimitability of the Qur'an. <!-- 1311  -->

The inimitability of (the Qur'an) consists in the fact that the (language of the Qur'an) indicates all the requirements of the situations (referred to), whether they are stated or understood. 

This is the highest stage of speech. In addition, (the Qur'an) is perfect 1312 in choice of words and excellence of
arrangement and combination. This is (its) inimitability, (a quality) that surpasses
comprehension. Something of it may be understood by those who have a taste 1313
for it as the result of their contact with the (Arabic) language and their possession of
the habit of it. 

They may thus understand as much of the inimitability of the Qur'an as their taste permits. Therefore, the Arabs who heard the Qur'an directly from (the Prophet) who brought it (to them) had a better understanding of its (inimitability
than later Muslims). 

They were the champions and arbiters of speech, and they possessed the greatest and best taste (for the language) that anyone could possibly
have.

This discipline is needed most by Qur'an commentators. Most ancient commentators disregarded it, until Jar-Allah az-Zamakhshari appeared. 1314 When he wrote his Qur'an commentary, he investigated each verse of the Qur'an according
to the rules of this discipline. 

This brings out, in part, its inimitability. It gives his commentary greater distinction than is possessed by any other commentary.

However, he tried to confirm the articles of faith of the (Mu'tazilah) innovators by deriving them from the Qur'an by means of different aspects of rhetoric (balaghah). Therefore, many orthodox Muslims have been on their guard against his
(commentary), despite his abundant knowledge of rhetoric (balaghah). 

However, there are people who have a good knowledge of the orthodox articles of faith and who have some experience in this discipline. They are able to refute him with his own weapons, or (at least) they know that (his work) contains innovations. They can avoid them, so that no harm is done to their religious beliefs. 

Such persons do not risk being affected by the innovations and sectarian beliefs. They should study (as-
Zamakhshari's commentary), in order to find out about certain (aspects of) the
inimitability of the Qur'an.

<!-- God guides whomever He wants to guide to "an even road." 1315 -->

The science of literatureThis science has no object the accidents of which may be studied and thus
be affirmed or denied. Philologists consider its purpose identical with its fruit,
which is (the acquisition of) a good ability to handle prose and poetry according to
the methods and ways of the Arabs. 

Therefore, they collect and memorize documents of Arabic speech that are likely to aid in acquiring the (proper
linguistic) habit. (Such documents include) high-class poetry, rhymed prose of an
even quality, and (certain) problems of lexicography and grammar, found scattered
among (documents of Arabic poetry and prose) and from which the student is, as a
rule, able to derive inductively most of the rules of Arabic.

In addition, they mention certain of the battle-day narratives of the Arabs, which serve to explain the
references to (battle days) occurring in the poems. Likewise, they mention famous
pedigrees and general historical information of importance. 

The purpose of all this is not to leave the students investigating such things in the dark about any (of the
documents of) Arabic speech, about any of the (literary) methods used, or about any
of the methods of Arab eloquence. 

Merely memorizing them does not give (a student the proper linguistic) habit, unless he first understands them. Therefore, he
must give preference to everything upon which understanding of (Arabic literature)
depends.

Philologists who wanted to define this discipline said= "Literature is expert knowledge of the poetry and history of the Arabs as well as the possession of some knowledge regarding every science." They meant (knowledge) of the linguistic
sciences and the religious sciences, but only the contents (of the latter) that is, the
Qur'an and the traditions. 

No other science has anything to do with Arab speech,
save in as much as recent scholars who have occupied themselves with the craft of
rhetorical figures ('ilm al-badi') have come to use allusion (tawriyah) 1316 by
means of (references to terms of) scientific terminologies, in their poetry and their
straight prose (tarsil). 1317 Therefore, litterateurs need to know scientific
terminologies, in order to be able to understand (such allusions).

We heard our shaykhs say in class that the basic principles and pillars of this
discipline are four works: the Adab al-katib by Ibn Qutaybah, 1318 the Kitab al-
Kamil by al-Mubarrad, 1319 the Kitab al-Bayan wa-t-tabyin by al-Jahiz 1320 and the
Kitab an-Nawadir by Abu 'Ali al-Qali al-Baghdadi. <!-- 1321  -->

All other books depend on these four and are derived from them. The works of recent writers on the subject are
numerous.

At the beginning of (Islam) singing (music) belonged to this discipline. (Singing) depends on poetry, because it is the setting of poetry to music. 1322 Secretaries and outstanding persons in the 'Abbasid dynasty occupied themselves
with it, because they were desirous of becoming acquainted with the methods and
(literary) disciplines of the Arabs. 1323 Its cultivation was no blemish on probity or
manliness. 

The early Hijazi Muslims in Medina and elsewhere, who are models for
everybody else to follow, cultivated it. 1324 Such a great (scholar) as Judge Abul-
Faraj al-Isfahani 1325 wrote a book on songs, the Kitab al-Aghani. In it, he dealt
with the whole of the history, poetry, genealogy, battle days, and ruling dynasties of
the Arabs. 

The basis for the work were one hundred songs which the singers had
selected for ar-Rashid. His work is the most complete and comprehensive one there
is. Indeed, it constitutes an archive of the Arabs. 1326 It is a collection of the disjecta
membra of all the good things in Arab poetry, history, song, and all the other
conditions (of the Arabs). There exists no book comparable to it, as far as we know.
It is the ultimate goal to which a litterateur can aspire and where he must stop - asthough he could ever get so far! 1327
Let us now return to the verification of our remarks about the linguistic
sciences in general (terms).
