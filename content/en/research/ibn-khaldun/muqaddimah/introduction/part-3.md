A parallel or similar story is that reported by the historians about Yahya bin Aktham, the judge and friend of al-Ma'mun.<!-- 101 --> 

He got drunk with al-Ma'mun one night from a date liquor (nabidh) which in their opinion was not forbidden.

<!-- He lay buried among the sweet basil until he woke up. The following verses are recited in his name:

q >}}
O my lord, commander of all the people!
He who gave me to drink was unjust in his judgment.
I neglected the cupbearer, and he caused me to be,
As you see me, deprived of intelligence and religion.
/q >}} -->


The same applies to Ibn Aktham and al-Ma'mun that applies to ar-Rashid.

There can be no question of drunkenness in connection with them. 

Yahyi's familiarity with al-Ma'mun was friendship in Islam. It is an established fact that Yahya slept in al-Ma'mum's room. 

It has been reported, as an indication of al-Ma'mun's excellence and affability, that one night he awoke,102 got up, and felt around for the chamber pot. He was afraid to wake Yahya b. Aktham. It also is an established fact that the two used to pray together at the morning prayer. 

How does that accord with drinking wine together! 

<!-- 103 -->
Furthermore, Yahya b. Aktham was a transmitter of traditions. He was praised by Ibn Hanbal and Judge Ismi'il. 

At-Tirmidhi published traditions on his authority. The hadith expert al-Mizzi mentioned that al-Bukhari transmitted traditions on Yahya's authority in works other than the Jami' (as-Sahih). 
<!-- 106  -->

To vilify Yahya is to vilify all of these scholars. 

Licentious persons accuse Yahya b. Aktham of liking young men. This is an affront to God and a malicious lie directed against religious scholars.

<!-- These persons base themselves on storytellers' silly reports, which perhaps were an invention of Yahya's enemies, for he was much envied because of his perfection and his friendship with the ruler. 

His position in scholarship and religion makes such a thing impossible. When Ibn Hanbal was told about these rumors concerning Yahya, he exclaimed= "For God's sake, for God's sake, who would say such a thing!" He disapproved of it very strongly. 

When the talk about Yahya was mentioned to Ismi'il, he exclaimed= "Heaven forbid that theprobity ('adalah) 107 of such a man should cease to exist because of the lying accusations of envious talebearers." 

He said:

"Yahya b. Aktham is innocent in the eyes of God of any such relationship with young men (as that) of which he is accused. I got to know his most intimate thoughts and found him to be much in fear of God. However, he possessed a certain playfulness and friendliness that might have provoked such accusations."  -->

<!-- Ibn Hibban mentioned him in the Thiqat. 109 He said that no attention should be paid to these tales about him because most of them were not correct. -->


### Al-Ma'mun

A similar story is the one about the basket reported by Ibn 'Abdrabbih, author of the 'Iqd, in explanation of how al-Ma'mun came to be al-Hasan b. Sahl's son-in-law by marrying his daughter Buran. 

One night, on his rambles through the streets of Baghdad, al-Ma'mun saw a basket being let down from one of the roofs by means of pulleys and twisted cords of silk thread. 

He seated himself in the basket and grabbed the pulley to go up. This led him to a magnificent chamber. 

<!-- of such-and-such a condition-Ibn 'Abdrabbih described the eye and soul-filling splendor of its carpets, the magnificence of its furnishings, and the beauty of its appearance.  -->

He saw a woman of extraordinary, seductive beauty in that room. She greeted al-Ma'mun and invited him to keep her company.

He drank wine with her the whole night long. In the morning he returned to his companions at the place where they had been awaiting him. He had fallen so much in love with the woman that he asked her father for her hand.

How does all this accord with al-Ma'mun's:
- well-known religion and learning
- imitation of the way of life of his forefathers, the right-guided 'Abbasid caliphs
- adoption of the way of life of those pillars of Islam
<!-- , the (first) four caliphs, with his -->
- respect for the religious scholars
- observance in his prayers and legal practice of the norms established by God! 

<!-- How could it be correct that he would act like (one of those) wicked scoundrels who amuse themselves by rambling about at night, entering strange houses in the dark, and engaging in nocturnal trysts in the manner of Bedouin lovers! And how does that story fit with the position and noble character of al-Hasan b. Sahl's daughter, and with the firm morality and chastity that reigned in her father's house!

There are many such stories. They are always cropping up in the works of the historians. The incentive for inventing and reporting them is a (general) inclination to forbidden pleasures and for smearing the reputation of others. People justify their own subservience to pleasure by citing men and women of the past (who allegedly did the same things they are doing). 

Therefore, they often appear very eager for such information and are alert to find it when they go through the pages of (published) works. 

If they would follow the example of the people (of the past) in other respects and in the qualities of perfection that were theirs and for which they are well known, "it would be better for them," 111 "if they would know." -->



I once criticized a royal prince for being so eager to learn to sing and play the strings. 

I told him it was not a matter that should concern him and that it did not befit his position. He referred me to Ibrahim b. al-'Mahdi 113 who was the leading musician and best singer in his time. 

I replied:

"For heaven's sake, why do you not rather follow the example of his father or his brother? Do you not see how that activity prevented Ibrahim from attaining their position?" 

The prince, however, was deaf to my criticism and turned away.



Further silly information which is accepted by many historians concerns the 'Ubaydid (-Fatimids), the Shi'ah caliphs in al-Qayrawan and Cairo. 114

These historians deny their 'Alid origin and attack the genuineness of their descent from the imam Ismail, the son of Ja'far as-Sadiq. 

They base themselves in this respect on stories that were made up in favor of the weak 'Abbasid caliphs by people who wanted to ingratiate themselves with them through accusations against their active opponents and who (therefore) liked to say all kinds of bad things about their enemies. 

We shall mention some such stories in our treatment of the history of (the 'Ubaydid-Fatimids). (These historians) do not care to consider the factual proofs and circumstantial evidence that require (us to recognize) that the contrary is true and that their claim is a lie and must be rejected.
