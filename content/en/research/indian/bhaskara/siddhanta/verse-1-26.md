### Verse 26

Half the life-period of the present Brahma has elapsed; 

Some said that only eight and half years of his life has elapsed—Let the Agama or tradition be whatsoever; we don't have any need of knowing it because the planetary positions have to be computed only from the beginning of this Kalpa.

<!-- Comm. Vateswara mentions that only eight and half years of the present Brahma had elapsed (Vide verse 10 Madhyadhikara ch. I Vateswara Siddhanta) Vateswara prescribes that Ahargana or the collection of days has to be calculated from the birth-time of this Brahma, but Bhaskara rightly points out that it is a waste of labour, for, all the planets must have returned to the Zero-point of the zodiac ie the beginning of the Star Asvini at the beginning of this Kalpa and hence it is sufficient to calculate only from the beginning of this Kalpa. Further Bhaskara states that when the very planets did not exist during the last elapsed night of Brahma, what is the fun of calculating their positions.

There is also a tradition that there are nine Brahmas and that the present one is the very first. This tradition Bhaskara does not mention, because he exclaims that he does not know how many Brahmas have gone by, Time being without a beginning. -->

### Verse 27

In as much as the creation started only from the beginning of this Kalpa which is the present day-time of Brahma, and because deluge takes place at the end of the day-time, the question of Computing the planetary positions arises only when the planets exist. 

If some (the allusion is to Vateswara) propose to compute the planetary positions even when the very planets did not exist, may we salute those great people !


### Verse 28

Six Manus have elapsed in this Kalpa, thereafter 27 yugas, as well as 3 yugapadas namely Krita, Treta and Dwapara. 

Further 3,179 years of this fourth yugapada namely Kali have elapsed by the end of the Saka king (which moment was the beginning of the Saka era). 

Hence in the present Kalpa ie the day-time of this Brahma, 19729 47179 years have elapsed upto the beginning of the Saka era.

<!-- Comm. The computation is as follows:

6 Manvantaras = 6 × 71 × 10 Kaliyugas since each Manvantara consists of 71 yugas and a yuga consists of 10 Kaliyugas (one yuga = Krita + Treta + Dwapara + Kali = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 Kaliyugas). The Sandhis that were there in between the Manus and in the beginning of the first Manu are seven and each Sandhi being equal to one Krita or four Kalis, the seven Sandhis = 7 × 4 = 28 Kaliyugas.

Further it is stated that 27 yugas had elapsed in the present seventh Manvantara known as Vaivasvata which are equal to 27 × 10 = 270 Kaliyugas. Further in the present yuga, Krita, Treta and Dwapara had elapsed equal to 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 Kaliyugas.

Thereafter in the present Kaliyuga 3179 years elapsed upto the beginning of the Saka era. Thus totalling we have 4260 + 28 + 270 + 9 Kalis + 3179 years.

= 4567 Kalis + 3179 years.
= 4567 × 432000 + 3179 years.
= 179 294 7179 year as mentioned. -->


### Verse 29

The six Manus that went before the present Vaivasvata were Swayambhuva, Swarocisa, Auttama Tamasa, Raivata and Caksbusha.

<!-- Comm. Clear—Upto this point we have seen the Brahmamana, the seventh of the nine manas. -->


### Verse 30

The Sambhitikas declare that a Samvatsara is equal to the time of a mean sidereal revolution of Guru the Jupiter (This is the Barhaspatyamana). 

The ninth mana named the Manushyamana is composite of the four manas (as detailed in verse 31).


### Verse 31

The manushya-mana or that which men follow, adopts the year, the Ayana the Rtu or the season (six in number during an year) and the yuga according to the movement of the Sun ie according to Sauramana the months and the thithis according to the luni-solar reckoning ie according to Chandramana the Vratas, upavasas, treatment of diseases, deliveries of ladies, the names of the weeks all these according to the reckoning of civil days ie according to Savanamana and finally the ghatis to the


### Verse 32

Thus there are 9 manas Manava, Divya (or of gods), Barhaspatya (Jovian) paitra, Nakshatra, Saura, Chandra, Savana and Brahma. 

But the planetary positions are to be computed by men by their own mana.
