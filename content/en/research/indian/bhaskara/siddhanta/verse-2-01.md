MADHYĀDHIKĀRA - SECTION II BHAGANĀDHYĀYA


<sup>1-6</sup> The number of sidereal revolutions of the Sun during a Kalpa is 4320000000. It is also the number of those of Mercury and Venus, and those of the Sighroccas of the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

The Moon makes 5775330000 sidereal revolutions in a Kalpa, the Mars 2296828522, the Mercury's sighrocca 1793699894, the Jupiter 364226155, the sighrocca of Venus 7022389492 and the Saturn 146567298. The sidereal revolutions of the apogees of the Sun and the Moon and those of the aphelia of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn in a Kalpa are respectively 430, 488105858, 292, 352, 855, 653. 41.

The retrograde sidereal revolutions of the nodes of the orbits of Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are respectively 232311168, 267, 521, 63, 893, 554.


<sup>7</sup> The number of diurnal revolutions of the stars in a Kalpa is 1582236450000.

<sup>8</sup> The number of solar days in a kalpa is 155..

The lunar days is 160..

<sup>9</sup> The number of civil days in a kalpa is equal to 157791645000; the number of the diurnal revolutions of the stars minus the number of sidereal revolutions of any particular planet constitute the days of that particular planet with respect to the earth.

<!-- Comm. The civil days in a kalpa are evidently the number of Sun-rises. These are as mentioned before the difference of the number of diurnal revolutions of the stars and the number of the sidereal revolutions of the Sun. By analogy, the number of the days of a particular planet with respect to the earth or what is the same the number of risings of that planet in a kalpa as seen from the earth, is the difference of the number of the diurnal revolutions of the stars and the number of the sidereal revolutions of that planet in a kalpa. Thus we have Saura-Ku-dinani, Chandra-Ku-dinani, Bhauma-Ku-dinani etc, where the word 'Ku' means the earth. The Saura-Ku-dinani are the civil days defined before. It will be noted that the Chandra-Ku-dinani are not the lunar days. -->


<sup>10</sup> The number of Adhikamasas or intercalary months in a kalpa is equal to 159330000 and the number of Dina-Kshayas is 25082550000.


<sup>11-12</sup> The number of solar months in a Kalpa is 5184000000; the number of lunar months is 5343330000. 

The number of solar months being subtracted from the number of lunations, we have the number of Adhikamasas—The number of solar days together with the days of Adhika months are equal to the lunar days or the tithis; or again the number of civil days minus the Kshayahas are equal to the number of civil days or the reverse will be had by a reverse process.


<sup>13</sup> The excess of the sidereal revolutions of the moon over the excess of the Sun's sidereal revolutions is equal to the number of chandramasas or lunations.

Or again the excess of the sum of the sidereal revolutions of the moon and the tithis over the sum of the lunations and the diurnal revolutions of the stars is equal to the number of Kshayahas.

<!-- Comm. The first part is clear. Regarding the second, let the number of lunations be x and the number of the sidereal revolutions of the moon be y. Then y - x = z, the number of the sidereal revolutions of the Sun because y - z = x from the first part above. If now, the number of the diurnal revolutions of the stars be t, then t - z = t - (y - x) = t + x - y = civil days. Subtracting these civil days from 'U' the number of Tithis, we have the number of Kshayahas namely U - (t + x - y) = (U + y) - (t + x) which accords with the sentence. -->



<sup>14</sup> The number of Adhikamasas is equal to the excess of the number of sidereal revolutions of the Moon over thirteen times the number of sidereal revolutions of the Sun.
