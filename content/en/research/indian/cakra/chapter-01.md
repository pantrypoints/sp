I speak of the first sprouting shoot (of the Yoga plant) of complete realization of the Brahman, which is to be achieved, according to the Tantras, by means of the six Cakras and so forth in their proper order.

In the space outside the Meru, placed on the left and the right, are the 2 Sirās:

1. Śaśī
2. Mihira

The substance of the Nāḍī Suṣuṃnā is the threefold Guṇas.
- This is in the middle.

She is the form of Moon, Sun, and Fire.

Her body:
- is a string of blooming Dhātūra flowers
- extends from the middle of the Kanda to the Head

The Vajrā inside Her extends, shining, from the Meḍhra[9] to the Head.


Inside her[1] is Citriṇī, who is lustrous with the lustre of the Praṇava[2] and attainable in Yoga by Yogīs. 

Citriṇī:
- is subtle as a spider’s thread
- pierces all the Lotuses which are placed within the backbone
- is pure intelligence
- is beautiful because of these Lotuses which are strung on her

Inside her is the Brahmanāḍī which extends from the orifice of the mouth of Hara to the place beyond, where Ādideva is.


She is beautiful like a chain of lightning and fine like a (lotus) fibre, and shines in the minds of the sages. 

She is extremely subtle.

The awakener of pure knowledge; the embodiment of all Bliss, whose true nature is pure Consciousness.

The Brahma-dvāra shines in her mouth. 

This place in the entrance to the region sprinkled by ambrosia, and is called the Knot, as also the mouth of Susuriinā.





<sup>4</sup> The Ādhāra Lotus:
- is attached to the mouth of the Suṣuṃnā below the genitals and above the anus.
- has 4 crimson petals

Its head (mouth) hangs downwards. 

On its petals are the 4 letters from Va to Sa, of the shining gold.


<sup>5</sup> In this (Lotus) is the square region (Cakra) of Pṛthivī, surrounded by 8 shining spears.

It is of a shining yellow and beautiful like lightning, as is also the Bīja of Dharā[4] which is within.


<sup>6</sup> Ornamented with 4 arms and mounted on the King of Elephants, He carries on His lap the child Creator, resplendent like the young Sun, who has 4 lustrous arms, and the wealth of whose lotus-face is fourfold.


<sup>7</sup> Here dwells the Devī Ḍākinī.

Her four arms shine with beauty, and her eyes are brilliant red. She is resplendent like the lustre of many Suns rising at one and the same time.

She is the carrier of the revelation of the ever-pure Intelligence


<sup>8</sup> Near the mouth of the Nāḍī called Vajrā, and in the pericarp (of the Ādhāra Lotus), there constantly shines the beautifully luminous and soft, lightning-like triangle which is Kāmarūpa,[1] and known as Traipura.[2] There is always and everywhere the Vāyu called Kandarpa,[3] who is of a deeper red than the Bandhujīva flower,[4] and is the Lord of Beings and resplendent like ten million suns.



<sup>9</sup> Inside it (the triangle) is Svayaṃbhu[1] in His Liṅga-form,[2] beautiful like molten gold, with His head downwards. He is revealed by Knowledge[3] and Meditation,[4] and is of the shape and colour of a new leaf. As the cool rays of lightning and of the full moon charm, so does His beauty. The Deva who resides happily here as in Kāśī is in forms like a whirlpool.[5]


<sup>10-11</sup> Over it shines the sleeping Kuṇḍalinī, fine as the fibre of the lotus-stalk. She is the world-bewilderer,[2] gently covering the mouth of Brahmadvāra[3] by Her own. 

Like the spiral of the conch-shell, Her shining snake-like form goes three and a half times round Śiva,[4] and Her lustre is as that of a strong flash of young strong lightning. Her sweet murmur is like the indistinct hum of swarms of love-mad bees.[5] She produces melodious poetry and Bandha[6] and all other compositions in prose or verse in sequence or otherwise[7] in Saṃskṛta, Prākṛta and other languages. It is She who maintains all the beings of the world by means of inspiration and expiration,[8] and shines in the cavity of the root (Mūla) Lotus like a chain of brilliant lights.
