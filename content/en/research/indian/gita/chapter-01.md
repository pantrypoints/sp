PREFACE

This famous and marvellous Sanskrit poem occurs as an episode of the Mahabharata, in the sixth--or "Bhishma"--Parva of the great Hindoo epic. It enjoys immense popularity and authority in India, where it is reckoned as one of the ``Five Jewels,"--pancharatnani--of Devanagiri literature. In plain but noble language it unfolds a philosophical system which remains to this day the prevailing Brahmanic belief, blending as it does the doctrines of Kapila, Patanjali, and the Vedas. So lofty are many of its declarations, so sublime its aspirations, so pure and tender its piety, that Schlegel, after his study of the poem, breaks forth into this outburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author: "Magistrorum reverentia a Brachmanis inter sanctissima pietatis officia refertur. Ergo te primum, Vates sanctissime, Numinisque hypopheta! quisquis tandem inter mortales dictus tu fueris, carminis bujus auctor,, cujus oraculis mens ad excelsa quaeque,quaeque,, aeterna atque divina, cum inenarraoih quddam delectatione rapitur-te primum, inquam, salvere jubeo, et vestigia tua semper adore." Lassen re-echoes this splendid tribute; and indeed, so striking are some of the moralities here inculcated, and so close the parallelism--ofttimes actually verbal-- between its teachings and those of the New Testament, that a controversy has arisen between Pandits and Missionaries on the point whether the author borrowed from Christian sources, or the Evangelists and Apostles from him.

This raises the question of its date, which cannot be positively settled. It must have been inlaid into the ancient epic at a period later than that of the original Mahabharata, but Mr Kasinath Telang has offered some fair arguments to prove it anterior to the Christian era. The weight of evidence, however, tends to place its composition at about the third century after Christ; and perhaps there are really echoes in this Brahmanic poem of the lessons of Galilee, and of the Syrian incarnation.

Its scene is the level country between the Jumna and the Sarsooti rivers-now Kurnul and Jheend. Its simple plot consists of a dialogue held by Prince Arjuna, the brother of King Yudhisthira, with Krishna, the Supreme Deity, wearing the disguise of a charioteer. A great battle is impending between the armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas, and this conversation is maintained in a war-chariot drawn up between the opposing hosts.

The poem has been turned into French by Burnouf, into Latin by Lassen, into Italian by Stanislav Gatti, into Greek by Galanos, and into English by Mr. Thomson and Mr Davies, the prose transcript of the last-named being truly beyond praise for its fidelity and clearness. Mr Telang has also published at Bombay a version in colloquial rhythm, eminently learned and intelligent, but not conveying the dignity or grace of the original. If I venture to offer a translation of the wonderful poem after so many superior scholars, it is in grateful recognition of the help derived from their labours, and because English literature would certainly be incomplete without possessing in popular form a poetical and philosophical work so dear to India.

There is little else to say which the "Song Celestial" does not explain for itself. The Sanskrit original is written in the Anushtubh metre, which cannot be successfully reproduced for Western ears. I have therefore cast it into our flexible blank verse, changing into lyrical measures where the text itself similarly breaks. For the most part, I believe the sense to be faithfully preserved in the following pages; but Schlegel himself had to say: "In reconditioribus me semper poetafoster mentem recte divinasse affirmare non ausim." Those who would read more upon the philosophy of the poem may find an admirable introduction in the volume of Mr Davies, printed by Messrs Trubner & Co.

{{< l a="Dhritirashtra" >}}
We are here for battle on the sacred plain on Kurukshetra. 

Sanjaya, what happened between my people and the Pandavas?
{{< /l >}}

The host of Pandavas, Raja Duryodhana<!--  to Drona drew -->, said: 

{{< r a="Sanjaya" >}}
Ah, Guru! The Pandu fighting-men are many. They were embattled by the son of Drupada, your scholar in the war! 

They have chiefs like:
- Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs
- Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan, Drupada, eminent upon his car, Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,
Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and 
- Saivya, With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!

They are all mounted on their shining chariots.

Our side has excellent chiefs:
- You
- Bhishma
- Karna
- Kripa fierce in fight
- Vikarna
- Aswatthaman

Then:
- Strong Saumadatti, with full many more Valiant and tried, ready this day to die for me, each with his weapon grasped,
Each skilful in the field. 

<!-- Weakest-meseems- -->

Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,

Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!

Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks

Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!
{{< /r >}}


Then, at the signal of the aged king, with blare to wake the blood, rolling around, like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter blew the great Conch. Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour. 

The tumult seemed like the blasts of loosened tempest!

Then might be seen, upon their car of gold
Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,
Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:

Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch carved of the "Giant's bone;" 

Arjuna blew Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible--Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;

Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son, winded a mighty shell, "Victory's Voice."

Nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on his Called"Gem-bedecked," and Kasi's Prince on his.

Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,
Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,
Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)

Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,
So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,
With quaking earth and thundering heav'n.

Then beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set, weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war instant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge was Hanuman the monkey, spoke to Krishna:

{{< r a="Arjuna">}}
Drive, Dauntless One to the open ground between the armies. I would see more these who will fight with us, those we must slay today, in war's arbitrament.

On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain, obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son.
{{< /r >}}


Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)

Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds where Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.

{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
See where your kindred of the Kurus stand
{{< /l >}}


The Prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house, grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons, cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed with friends and honoured elders; 

Some this side, some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed, such kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heart melted with pity:

{{< r a="Arjuna">}}
Krishna! as I behold those who come here to shed their common blood my members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, a shudder thrills my body, and my hair bristles with horror.

From my weak hand slips Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns my skin to parching; hardly may I stand;

The life within me seems to swim and faint;

Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail! 

It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good

Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate triumph and domination, wealth and ease, thus sadly won! Aho! what victory

Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils could profit; what rule recompense; what span of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? 

Seeing that these stand here, ready to die, for whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, and power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons, brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, elders and friends! 

Shall I deal death on these Even though they seek to slay us? 

Not one blow, O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain the rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less to seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these must breed but anguish, Krishna!

If they be guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin; What peace could come of that, O Madhava? 

For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, these cannot see, or will not see, the sin of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, How should not we, who see, shun such a crime-- We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame-- O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?

By overthrow of houses perishes their sweet continuous household piety, and-rites neglected, piety extinct-- enters impiety upon that home;

Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, sending a Hell-ward road that family, and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.

Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace, being bereft of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.

So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,

Ahovat! what an evil fault it were! Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike, to face them weaponless, and bare my breast to shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.
{{< /r >}}


So speaking, in the face of those two hosts, Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, and let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.
