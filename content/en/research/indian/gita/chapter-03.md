<sup>1</sup> O Janārdana, O Keśava, why do You want to engage me in this ghastly warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?

<sup>2</sup> My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Which path is best for me?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- 3</sup> Arjuna, There are 2 classes of men who try to realize the self. Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service. -->

<sup>3</sup> There are 2 paths, 2 schools of wisdom.

1. The Sankhya's

This saves through the way of works or action or karma prescribed by reason

2. The Yoga

This is attained by meditation and spirituality.


<sup>4</sup> Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection.

<sup>5</sup> Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.

<sup>6</sup> One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.

<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by the mind and begins karma-yoga [in Kṛṣṇa consciousness] without attachment, he is by far superior.

<sup>8</sup> Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working. One cannot even maintain one’s physical body without work.

<sup>9</sup> Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed; otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. 

Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.

<sup>10</sup> In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Viṣṇu, and blessed them by saying, “Be thou happy by this yajña [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you everything desirable for living happily and achieving liberation.”

<sup>11</sup> The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you, and thus, by cooperation between men and demigods, prosperity will reign for all.

<sup>12</sup> In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajña [sacrifice], will supply all necessities to you. But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief.

<sup>13</sup> The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.

<sup>14</sup> All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajña [sacrifice], and yajña is born of prescribed duties.

<sup>15</sup> Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 

Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.

<sup>16</sup> My dear Arjuna, one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice thus established by the Vedas certainly leads a life full of sin. Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain.

<sup>17</sup> But for one who takes pleasure in the Self, whose human life is one of self-realization, and who is satisfied in the Self only, fully satiated – for him there is no duty.

<sup>18</sup> A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being.

<sup>19</sup> Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.

<sup>20</sup> Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work.

<sup>21</sup> Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.

<sup>22</sup> O son of Pṛthā, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems. Nor am I in want of anything, nor have I a need to obtain anything – and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties.

<sup>23</sup> For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties, O Pārtha, certainly all men would follow My path.

<sup>24</sup> If I did not perform prescribed duties, all these worlds would be put to ruination. I would be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all living beings.

<sup>25</sup> As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.

<sup>26</sup> So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of prescribed duties, a learned person should not induce them to stop work. Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage them in all sorts of activities [for the gradual development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness].

<sup>27</sup> The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.

<sup>28</sup> One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results.

<sup>29</sup> Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached. But the wise should not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers’ lack of  knowledge.

<sup>30</sup> Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with full knowledge of Me, without desires for profit, with no claims to proprietorship, and free from lethargy, fight.

<sup>31</sup> Those persons who execute their duties according to My injunctions and who follow this teaching faithfully, without envy, become free from the bondage of fruitive actions.

<sup>32</sup> But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not follow them regularly are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and ruined in their endeavors for perfection.

<sup>33</sup> Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes. What can repression accomplish?

<sup>34</sup> There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.

<sup>35</sup> It is far better to discharge one’s prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another’s duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path is dangerous.

{{< r a="Arjuna" >}}
<sup>36</sup> O descendant of Vṛṣṇi, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
<sup>37</sup> It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.

<sup>38</sup> As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust.

<sup>39</sup> Thus the wise living entity’s pure consciousness becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.

<sup>40</sup> The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.

<sup>41</sup> Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bhāratas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization.

<sup>42</sup> The working senses are superior to dull matter.

Mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.

<sup>43</sup> Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence [Kṛṣṇa consciousness] and thus – by spiritual strength – conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.

<!-- <sup>4</sup> These are one.
- No one can escape karma by shunning action.
- No one can attain perfection by mere renouncements . -->

<!-- Nay, and no jot of time, at any time,
Rests any actionless; his  -->

<!-- <sup>5</sup> Nature's law compels the yogi to act, even if he is unwilling. [Even thought is act in fancy]. 

<sup>6</sup> A guilty hypocrite sits suppressing his bodily desires yet thinks about them in his idle heart. 

<sup>7</sup> But an honourable person is he who, with strong body serving mind, gives up his mortal powers to do worthy work, not seeking gain. 



<sup>8</sup> Do your duty! Work is more excellent than idleness. 

Even the body's maintenance would not be possible by inaction.

<sup>9</sup> The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice.

Do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti, perform action for that sake (for sacrifice) alone, free from attachment!

The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.
There is a task of holiness to do, Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not

The faithful soul; such earthly duty do
Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform

<sup>10</sup> Prajapati said</sup>

In the beginning, when all men were made, And, with mankind, the sacrifice-- "Do this!
Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,
Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;

The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven

No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world."

Those who eat food after their sacrifice are free of fault. But those who spread a feast all for themselves, eat and drink sin.

Food comes of rain. Rain comes by the pious sacrifice. Sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil. 

Thus, action is of Brahma, who is One,The Only, All-pervading. At all times He is present in sacrifice. 

He who abstains to help this great world, glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life, shameful and vain. He exists for himself, and is self-concentrated, serving self alone.

He has</sup>
- no part in the world
- no achievements, 
Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; 
- no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him.[FN#5] 

Therefore, thy task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform,
Since in performance of plain duty man
Mounts to his highest bliss. 

By works alone Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness!

Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind, action thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose
The unwise people take; what best men do The multitude will follow. Look on me,
Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds
I am not bound to any toil, no height
Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,
Yet I act here! and, if I acted not--
Earnest and watchful--those that look to me
For guidance, sinking back to sloth again
Because I slumbered, would decline from good,
And I should break earth's order and commit
Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata!

Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,
So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set
To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;
Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts seed of despair. 

Let each play his part in all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.

All things are everywhere by Nature wrought in interaction of the qualities.

The fool, cheated by self, thinks, "This I did"
And "That I wrought; "but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--
A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play
Of visible things within the world of sense,
And how the qualities must qualify,
Standeth aloof even from his acts. 

The untaught live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way, of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.
Those make thou not to stumble, having the light; 

But all thy dues discharging, for My sake, with meditation centred inwardly,
Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene, Heedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep
My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts, Have quittance from all issue of their acts;
But those who disregard My ordinance, Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,
Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one Doth of his kind, following what fits him most</sup>

Lower creatures of their kind; in vain
Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be
The objects of the sense will stir the sense
To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man
Yields not to these, knowing them enemies.

<sup>35</sup> It is better to do one's own duty, even he fails to succeed in doing the duty of another.
It is better to die performing one's duty, than to do another's duty with fear. 

<sup>36</sup> What causes a man to turn bad unwillingly?
 -->

<!-- Better is one’s own duty, though devoid of merit, than the duty of another well
discharged.

Better is death in one’s own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear. -->




<!-- <sup>37</sup> It is desire, it is anger born of the quality of Rajas, all-sinful and all-devouring; know this
as the foe here in this world.

<sup>38</sup> As smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust
Mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds
The babe unborn, so is the world of things
Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.

The wise fall when caught in it. The unresting foe
It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,
Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.

Sense, mind, and reason--these are booty for it; in its play with these
It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.

Therefore, govern your heart! 
- Constrain the entangled sense. 
- Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment

The world is strong, but what discerns it stronger. The mind is the strongest and is high above all the ruling Soul. -->

<!-- Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,
Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!
Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay
What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!
 -->
