<!-- ## Knowledge of the Absolute -->

<sup>1</sup> Hear how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.

<sup>2</sup> This is phenomenal and numinous knowledge. This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know.

<sup>3</sup> Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.

<sup>4</sup> My manifest form is made up of:

1. Earth
2. Water
3. Flame
4. Air
5. Aether
6. life
7. mind
8. Individuality (false ego)


<sup>5</sup> These are my lower material Nature. Learn my higher Nature that produces this Universe by its principle of life. 

<!-- I am that womb. I make and I unmake this Universe. -->

<sup>6</sup> All created beings have their source in these 2 natures.

Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution.

<sup>7</sup> O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.

<sup>8</sup> O son of Kuntī, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable oṁ in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.

<sup>9</sup> I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.

<sup>10</sup> O son of Pṛthā, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.

<sup>11</sup> I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O lord of the Bhāratas [Arjuna].

<sup>12</sup> Know that all states of being – be they of goodness, passion or ignorance – are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.

<sup>13</sup> Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.

<sup>14</sup> This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.

<sup>15</sup> Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me.

<sup>16</sup> O best among the Bhāratas, four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional service unto Me – the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.

<sup>17</sup> Of these, the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.

<sup>18</sup> All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal.

<sup>19</sup> After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.

<sup>20</sup> Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.

<sup>21</sup> I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity.

<sup>22</sup> Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.

<sup>23</sup> Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.

<sup>24</sup> Unintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is imperishable and supreme.

<sup>25</sup> I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.

<sup>26</sup> O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.

<sup>27</sup> O scion of Bharata, O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate.

<sup>28</sup> Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.

<sup>29</sup> Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities.

<sup>30</sup> Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be the governing principle of the material manifestation, of the demigods, and of all methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even at the time of death.




<!-- Learn now how to set your soul ever on Me by being</sup>
- still in exercising Yoga
- still in making Me your Refuge

You will come most surely unto perfect hold of Me.

I will teach you that utmost lore, Whole and particular so that you will know everything that you need to know in this world.

Of many thousand mortals, one strives for Truth.
- Of those few who strive, one only knows Me as the very Truth.





I am the fresh taste of the water; I
The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun,
The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill
That passeth in the ether, and the strength
Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell
Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light,
The vital air moving in all which moves,
The holiness of hallowed souls, the root
Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;
The wisdom of the wise, the intellect
Of the informed, the greatness of the great.
The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son!

I am free from passion and desire.
- Yet am I right desire in all who yearn, chief of the Bharatas.

All those moods, soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant deduce from me. 

But all are merged in me, not I in them. 

The world is deceived by those 3 qualities of being. 

Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all,
Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is

To pierce that veil divine of various shows
Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me
Pierce it and pass beyond.
I am not known

To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones, nor to the base and churlish; nor to those
Whose mind is cheated by the show of things,
Nor those that take the way of Asuras.[FN#12]

Four kinds of mortals know me</sup>

1. He who weeps
2. He who yearns to know
3. He who toils to help
4. He who sits certain of me, enlightened.

Of these four, the highest, nearest, best is the last kind. 

It is the devout soul, wise, intent upon "The One." 

I am the dearest to him, and he is dearest to me.

All four are good, and seek me. 

But mine own, the true of heart, the faithful--stayed on me, taking me as their utmost blessedness,
They are not "mine,"but I--even I myself!

At end of many births to Me they come!

Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,
That man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!"[FN#13]
There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside

By this desire or that, gives them to serve
Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained
By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such--
Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith--
'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!

The heart thus asking favour from its God,
Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,

The lesser blessing--but 'tis I who give!
Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap</sup>
Those men of little minds, who worship so,
Go where they worship, passing with their gods.

But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes
Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest,
Not comprehending Me in my true Self!

Imperishable, viewless, undeclared, hidden behind my magic veil of shows,
I am not seen by all; I am not known--Unborn and changeless--to the idle world.

Know all things which were, and all which are, and all which are to be,
Albeit not one among them knoweth Me!
By passion for the "pairs of opposites,"

By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!
All creatures live bewildered, save some few
Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,
Freed from the "opposites,"and fixed in faith,
Cleave unto Me.

Who cleave, who seek in Me refuge from birth[FN#14] and death, those have the Truth!

Those know</sup>
- BRAHMA know Me
- ADHYATMAN know the Soul of Souls
- KARMA know my work
- ADHIBHUTA know the Lord of Life
- ADHIDAIVA know the Lord of all the Gods
- ADHIYAJNA know the Lord of Sacrifice

Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith, and find and hold me in the hour of death.
