Now I will teach you <!--  I open unto you--whose heart Rejects not--that  --> the last lore, deepest-concealed. 

<!--  That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths,
Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,-- -->

Such light as purges the soul from every sin; a light of holiness With inmost splendour shining; plain to see;
Easy to walk by, inexhaustible!

They that receive not this, failing in faith
To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me,
Destroyer of thy foes!

They sink anew into the realm of Flesh, where all things change.

By Me the whole vast Universe of things is spread abroad;--by Me, the Unmanifest.

In Me are all existences contained; Not I in them.

Yet they are not contained,
Those visible things! 

Receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical.

 My Being--
Creating all, sustaining all--still dwells
Outside of all!

See! as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space, but are not space,
[And space were space without the moving airs];

So all things are in Me, but are not I.

At closing of each Kalpa, all things which be back to My Being come:

At the beginning of each Kalpa, all issue new-born from Me.

By Energy and help of Prakriti my outer Self, again, and again, I make the realms of visible things go forth--without their will--
All of them--by the power of Prakriti.

Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not
Enchain Me not! 

I sit apart from them, Other, and Higher, and Free unattached.

Thus the stuff of worlds are moulded by Me, bring forth all that which is, moving or still,
Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!

The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;--
Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought
Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.
Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed
On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek
An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.

My Mahatmas are noble souls who tread the celestial path.
- They worship Me with hearts unwandering
- They know Me  as the Eternal Source of Life.
- Unendingly they glorify Me, seek Me, keep their vows of reverence and love, with changeless faith adoring Me.

 Yea, and those too adore,
Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,
Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress,
One Force in every place, though manifold!

I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!
I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!
I am the healing herb! I am the ghee, The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!
I am-of all this boundless Universe-
The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!

The end of Learning! That which purifies in lustral water! I am OM! I am
Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;

The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,
The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,
The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life
Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds
And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,
Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine;
Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;
Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,
Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,
And Life Invisible!

Those who learn the threefold Vedas, who drink the Soma-wine,
Purge sins, pay sacrifice--from Me they earn
Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine
Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.

Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,
Paradise spent, and wage for merits given,
Come to the world of death and change once more.

They had their recompense! they stored their treasure,
Following the threefold Scripture and its writ;
Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure
Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!
But to those blessed ones who worship Me,
Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,
I bring assurance of full bliss beyond.
Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods

In simple faith, their prayers arise to me even if they pray wrongfully;

For I am the Receiver and the Lord of every sacrifice, which these know not

Rightfully; so they fall to earth again!

Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow
Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds
To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;
And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.
Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love
A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,
That offering I accept, lovingly made
With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!
Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,
Praying or fasting, let it all be done
For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself
From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men
To good and evil issue, so shalt come
Safe unto Me-when thou art quit of flesh--
By faith and abdication joined to Me!
I am alike for all! I know not hate,
I know not favour! What is made is Mine!
But them that worship Me with love, I love;
They are in Me, and I in them!
Nay, Prince!

If one of evil life turn in his thought
Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good;
He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow
Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace
Which changes not. 

Those who trust Me cannot perish.  

whoso will turn to Me, though they be born from the very womb of Sin,
Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste
Or lowly disregarded Sudra,--

all Plant foot upon the highest path; how then
The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?
Ah! ye who into this ill world are come--
Fleeting and false--set your faith fast on Me!
Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! 

Bring offerings to Me! 

Make Me prostrations! Make
Me your supremest joy! and, undivided,
Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided.
