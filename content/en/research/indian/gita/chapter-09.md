<sup>1</sup> My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization which will relieve you of the miseries of material existence.

<sup>2</sup> This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. 

It is the purest knowledge.

It gives direct perception of the self by realization and so it is the perfection of religion.

It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.


<sup>3</sup> Those who are not faithful in this devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of enemies.

Therefore they return to the path of birth and death in this material world.

<sup>4</sup> By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.

<sup>5</sup> Yet everything that is created does not rest in Me.

Behold My mystic opulence! 

Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation.

<sup>6</sup> Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me.

<sup>7</sup> O son of Kuntī, at the end of the millennium all material manifestations enter into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I create them again.

<sup>8</sup> The whole cosmic order is under Me. Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end.

<sup>9</sup> O Dhanañjaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral.

<sup>10</sup> This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.

<sup>11</sup> Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.

<sup>12</sup> Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.

<sup>13</sup> O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.

<sup>14</sup> Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.

<sup>15</sup> Others, who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, as diverse in many, and in the universal form.

<sup>16</sup> But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the offering.

<sup>17</sup> I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable oṁ. I am also the Ṛg, the Sāma and the Yajur Vedas.

<sup>18</sup> I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.

<sup>19</sup> O Arjuna, I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain. I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit and matter are in Me.

<sup>20</sup> Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.

<sup>21</sup> When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death.

<sup>22</sup> But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form – to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have.

<sup>23</sup> Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way.

<sup>24</sup> I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down.

<sup>25</sup> Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.

<sup>26</sup> If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.

<sup>27</sup> Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform – do that, O son of Kuntī, as an offering to Me.

<sup>28</sup> In this way you will be freed from bondage to work and its auspicious and inauspicious results. With your mind fixed on Me in this principle of renunciation, you will be liberated and come to Me.

<sup>29</sup> I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.

<sup>30</sup> Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination.

<sup>31</sup> He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.

<sup>32</sup> O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth – women, vaiśyas [merchants] and śūdras [workers] – can attain the supreme destination.

<sup>33</sup> How much more this is so of the righteous brāhmaṇas, the devotees and the saintly kings. Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me.

<sup>34</sup> Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.



<!-- 
Such light as purges the soul from every sin; a light of holiness With inmost splendour shining; plain to see;
Easy to walk by, inexhaustible!

They that receive not this, failing in faith
To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me,
Destroyer of thy foes!

They sink anew into the realm of Flesh, where all things change.

By Me the whole vast Universe of things is spread abroad;--by Me, the Unmanifest.

In Me are all existences contained; Not I in them.

Yet they are not contained,
Those visible things! 

Receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical.

 My Being--
Creating all, sustaining all--still dwells
Outside of all!

See! as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space, but are not space,
[And space were space without the moving airs];

So all things are in Me, but are not I.

At closing of each Kalpa, all things which be back to My Being come</sup>

At the beginning of each Kalpa, all issue new-born from Me.

By Energy and help of Prakriti my outer Self, again, and again, I make the realms of visible things go forth--without their will--
All of them--by the power of Prakriti.

Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not
Enchain Me not! 

I sit apart from them, Other, and Higher, and Free unattached.

Thus the stuff of worlds are moulded by Me, bring forth all that which is, moving or still,
Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!

The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;--
Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought
Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.
Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed
On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek
An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.

My Mahatmas are noble souls who tread the celestial path.
- They worship Me with hearts unwandering
- They know Me  as the Eternal Source of Life.
- Unendingly they glorify Me, seek Me, keep their vows of reverence and love, with changeless faith adoring Me.

 Yea, and those too adore,
Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,
Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress,
One Force in every place, though manifold!

I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!
I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!
I am the healing herb! I am the ghee, The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!
I am-of all this boundless Universe-
The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!

The end of Learning! That which purifies in lustral water! I am OM! I am
Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;

The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,
The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,
The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life
Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds
And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,
Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine;
Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;
Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,
Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,
And Life Invisible!

Those who learn the threefold Vedas, who drink the Soma-wine,
Purge sins, pay sacrifice--from Me they earn
Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine
Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.

Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,
Paradise spent, and wage for merits given,
Come to the world of death and change once more.

They had their recompense! they stored their treasure,
Following the threefold Scripture and its writ;
Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure
Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!
But to those blessed ones who worship Me,
Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,
I bring assurance of full bliss beyond.
Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods

In simple faith, their prayers arise to me even if they pray wrongfully;

For I am the Receiver and the Lord of every sacrifice, which these know not

Rightfully; so they fall to earth again!

Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow
Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds
To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;
And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.
Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love
A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,
That offering I accept, lovingly made
With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!
Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,
Praying or fasting, let it all be done
For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself
From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men
To good and evil issue, so shalt come
Safe unto Me-when thou art quit of flesh--
By faith and abdication joined to Me!
I am alike for all! I know not hate,
I know not favour! What is made is Mine!
But them that worship Me with love, I love;
They are in Me, and I in them!
Nay, Prince!

If one of evil life turn in his thought
Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good;
He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow
Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace
Which changes not. 

Those who trust Me cannot perish.  

whoso will turn to Me, though they be born from the very womb of Sin,
Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste
Or lowly disregarded Sudra,--

all Plant foot upon the highest path; how then
The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?
Ah! ye who into this ill world are come--
Fleeting and false--set your faith fast on Me!
Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! 

Bring offerings to Me! 

Make Me prostrations! Make
Me your supremest joy! and, undivided,
Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided.
