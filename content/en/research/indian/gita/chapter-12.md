<sup>1</sup> Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Krishna" >}}
<sup>2</sup> Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.

<sup>3-4</sup> But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and immovable – the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth – by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.

<sup>5</sup> For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.

<sup>6-7</sup> But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Pṛthā – for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.

<sup>8</sup> Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.

<sup>9</sup> Arjuna, if you cannot fix your mind on Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way develop a desire to attain Me.

<sup>10</sup> If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.

<sup>11</sup> If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.

<sup>12</sup> If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind.

<sup>13-14</sup> One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me – such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.

<sup>15</sup> He by whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me.

<sup>16</sup> My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me.

<sup>17</sup> One who neither rejoices nor grieves, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things – such a devotee is very dear to Me.


<sup>18-19</sup> One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn’t care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service – such a person is very dear to Me.


I love such a person who:
- does not troubles others nor is troubled by them. 
- is clear of wrath
- living above gladness, grief, or fear
- dwells quiet-eyed, stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,
- works with Me, yet detached from all works
- fixed in faith on Me
- dotes upon none
- scorns none
- rejoices not
- grieves not
- letting good or evil happen
- letting in Light when it will, and let it will depart
- keeps an equal heart to friend and foe
- with equal mind bears shame and glory
- with an equal peace takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain
- quit of desires,
- hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint unmoved by each
- linked by no ties to earth
- steadfast in Me

<sup>20</sup> But most of all, I love those who do devotional service and completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal.

<!-- Lord! of the men who serve Thee--true in heart--
As God revealed; and of the men who serve,
Worshipping Thee Unrevealed, Unbodied, Far, -->
<!-- Which take the better way of faith and life?

Krishna.

Whoever serve Me--as I show Myself-- Constantly true, in full devotion fixed,
Those hold I very holy. But who serve--
Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible,
The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable,
Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure--
Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense,
Of one set mind to all, glad in all good,
These blessed souls come unto Me.

Yet, hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach th' Unmanifest. That viewless path sShall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! 

But whereso any doeth all his deeds Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed
To serve only the Highest, night and day Musing on Me--him will I swiftly lift
Forth from life's ocean of distress and death, Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!

Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell surely with Me on high. But if thy thought
Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set Body and soul upon Me constantly,
Despair not! Give Me lower service! 

Seek To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;

If thou canst not worship steadfastly, work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!
For he that laboureth right for love of Me shall finally attain! 

But, if in this your faint heart fails, bring Me your failure. Find refuge in Me and let fruits of labour go.

Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart, so you shall come. 

To know is more than diligence, yet worship better is than knowing, and renouncing better still.

Very near to renunciation dwells Eternal Peace. 

Who hateth nought
Of all which lives, living himself benign,
compassionate, from arrogance exempt,
Exempt from love of self, unchangeable
By good or ill; patient, contented, firm
In faith, mastering himself, true to his word,
Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,--
