<sup>4</sup> The following qualities belong to those of non-divine nature:

<sup>5</sup> The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demoniac qualities make for bondage. 

Do not worry, O son of Pāṇḍu, for you are born with the divine qualities.

<sup>6</sup> O son of Pṛthā, in this world there are 2 kinds of created beings.

1. Divine
2. Non-Divine


<sup>7</sup> The non-divine do not know:
- what is to be done
- what is not to be done

Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.

<sup>8</sup> They say that this world is unreal, with no foundation, no God in control.

They say it is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.

<sup>9</sup> They are lost to themselves and have no intelligence. And so they engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

<sup>10</sup> Taking shelter of insatiable lust and absorbed in the conceit of pride and false prestige, the demoniac, thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.

<sup>11-12</sup> They believe that to gratify the senses is the prime necessity of human civilization.

Thus until the end of life their anxiety is immeasurable. Bound by a network of hundreds of thousands of desires and absorbed in lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.

<sup>13-15</sup> The demonic person thinks “So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more.

He is my enemy. I have killed him.

My other enemies will also be killed. 

I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. 

I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.” In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.

<sup>16</sup> Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, they become too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and fall down into hell.

<sup>17</sup> Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes proudly perform sacrifices in name only, without following any rules or regulations.

<sup>18</sup> Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demons become envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in their own bodies and in the bodies of others, and blaspheme against the real religion.

<sup>19</sup> Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.

<sup>20</sup> Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, O son of Kuntī, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.

<sup>21</sup> There are three gates leading to this hell are:

1. Lust [2nd chakra]
2. Anger [1st chakra]
3. Greed [3rd chakra]

Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.

<sup>22</sup> The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kuntī, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.

<sup>23</sup> He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.

<sup>24</sup> One should therefore understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.
