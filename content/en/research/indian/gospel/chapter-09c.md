## Characteristics of divine love

MASTER: "You talk glibly about prema. But is it such a commonplace thing? There are
two characteristics of prema. First, it makes one forget the world. So intense is one's
love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic
love; he 'took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindāvan and the ocean for the dark
waters of the Jamuna'. Second, one has no feeling of 'my-ness' toward the body, which
is so dear to man. One wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul.


## Indications of God-realization

"There are certain signs of God-realization. The man in whom longing for God manifests
its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are
discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their
company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When
you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision
of God is not far to seek.

"The state of a servant's house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has
decided to visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are cleared up.
Second, the soot and dirt are removed from the rooms. Third, the courtyard, floors, and
other places are swept clean. 

Finally the master himself sends various things to the house such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble for smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come"

A DEVOTEE: "Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?"

MASTER: "That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner organs3 are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows. Can carnal pleasure attract a grief-stricken man and woman the
day their child has died?"

Efficacy of japa and prayer

DEVOTEE: "How can I develop love for God?"

MASTER: "Repeat His name, and sins will disappear. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the desire for creature comforts, and so on."

DEVOTEE: "How can I take delight in God's name?"

MASTER: "Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name. He will certainly fulfil your heart's desire."

So saying, the Master sang a song in his sweet voice, pleading with the Divine Mother to show Her grace to suffering men:

O Mother, I have no one else to blame: 

Alas! I sink in the well these very hands have dug.
With the six passions for my spade,
I dug a pit in the sacred land of earth;
And now the dark water of death gushes forth!
How can I save myself, O my Redeemer?
Surely I have been my own enemy;
How can I now ward off this dark water of death?
Behold, the waters rise to my chest!
How can I save myself? O Mother, save me!
Thou art my only Refuge; with Thy protecting glance
Take me across to the other shore of the world.

The Master sang again:

What a delirious fever is this that I suffer from!
O Mother, Thy grace is my only cure.
False pride is the fever that racks my wasted form;
"I" and "mine" are my cry. Oh, what a wicked delusion!
My quenchless thirst for wealth and friends is never-ceasing;

How, then, shall I sustain my life?

Talk about things unreal, this is my wretched delirium,
And I indulge in it always, O Giver of all good fortune!
My eyes in seeming sleep are closed, my stomach is filled
With the vile worms of cruelty.

Alas! I wander about absorbed in unmeaning deeds;
Even for Thy holy name I have no taste, O Mother!
I doubt that I shall ever be cured of this malady.
Then the Master said: " 'Even for Thy holy name I have no taste.' A typhoid patient has
very little chance of recovery if he loses all taste for food; but his life need not be
despaired of if he enjoys food even a little. That is why one should cultivate a taste for
God's name. Any name will do-Durga, Krishna, or Śiva. Then if, through the chanting of
the name, one's attachment to God grows day by day, and joy fills the soul, one has
nothing to fear. The delirium will certainly disappear; the grace of God will certainly
descend.


## Parable of the two friends

" 'As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain.' Once two friends were going along the
street, when they saw some people listening to a reading of the Bhagavata. 'Come,
friend', said the one to the other. 'Let us hear the sacred book.' So saying he went in
and sat down. 

The second man peeped in and went away. He entered a house of ill
fame. But very soon he felt disgusted with the place. 'Shame on me!' he said to
himself. 'My friend has been listening to the sacred word of Hari; and see where I am!'
But the friend who had been listening to the Bhagavata also became disgusted. 'What a
fool I am!' he said. 'I have been listening to this fellow's blah-blah, and my friend is
having a grand time.' In course of time they both died. The messenger of Death came
for the soul of the one who had listened to the Bhagavata and dragged it off to hell. The
messenger of God came for the soul of the one who had been to the house of
prostitution and led it up to heaven.

"Verily, the Lord looks into a man's heart and does not judge him by what he does or
where he lives. 'Krishna accepts a devotee's inner feeling of love.'

"In the Kartabhaja sect, the teacher, while giving initiation, says to the disciple, 'Now
everything depends on your mind.' According to this sect, 'He who has the right mind
find the right way and also achieves the right end.' It was through the power of his mind
that Hanuman leapt over the sea. 'I am the servant of Rāma; I have repeated the holy
name of Rāma. Is there anything impossible for me?'-that was Hanuman's faith.

"Ignorance lasts as long as one has ego. There can be no liberation so long as the ego
remains. 'O God, Thou art the Doer and not I'-that is knowledge.

"By being lowly one can rise high. The chatak bird makes its nest on low ground, but it
soars very high in the sky. Cultivation is not possible on high land; in low land water
accumulates and makes cultivation possible.

"One must take the trouble to seek the company of holy persons. In his own home a
man hears only worldly talk; the disease of worldliness has become chronic with him.
The caged parrot sitting on its perch repeats, 'Rāma! Rāma!' But let it fly to the forest
and it will squawk in its usual way.

"Mere possession of money doesn't make a nobleman. One sign of the mansion of a
nobleman is that all the rooms are lighted. The poor cannot afford much oil, and
consequently cannot have so many lights. This shrine of the body should not be left
dark; one should illumine it with the lamp of Wisdom. Lighting the lamp of knowledge in
the chamber of your heart, Behold the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment.

"Everyone can attain Knowledge. There are two entities: Jivatma, the individual soul,
and Paramatma, the Supreme Soul. Through prayer all individual souls can be united to
the Supreme Soul. Every house has a connection for gas, and gas can be obtained from
the main storage-tank of the Gas Company. Apply to the Company, and it will arrange
for your supply of gas. Then your house will be lighted.

"In some people spiritual consciousness has already been awakened; but they have
special marks. They do not enjoy hearing or talking about anything but God. They are
like the chatak, which prays for rain-water though the seven oceans, the Ganges, the
Jamuna, and the rivers near it are all filled with water. It won't drink anything but rain-
water, even though its throat is burning with thirst."

The Master wanted to hear a few songs. Ramlal and a brahmin official of the temple
garden sang:

Dwell, O Lord, O Lover of bhakti,
In the Vrindāvan of my heart,
And my devotion unto Thee
Will be Thy Radha, dearly loved. . . .
And again:
The dark cloud of the summer storm fades into nothingness,
When, flute in hand and a smile on His lips,
Lighting the world with His loveliness,
Krishna, the Dark One, appears.
His dazzling yellow robe outgleams even the lightning's glare;
A wreath of wild-flowers interwoven
Gently swings from His youthful breast
And softly kisses His feet.
See, there He stands, the Lord of life, the Moon of Nanda's
line,

Outshining all the moons in heaven
And with the splendour of His rays
Flooding the Jamuna's bank!
226He stands there, stealing the maidens' hearts;
He lures them from hearth and home.
Krishna enters my own heart's shrine,
And with His flute-note steals away
My wisdom, life, and soul.
To whom shall Ganga Narayana pour out his tale of woe?
Ah, friend, you might have understood
Had you but gone to the Jamuna's bank
To fill your water-jar!

Again they sang:

High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring
like a kite,
When came a blast of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly
toward the earth. . . .
Zeal for the Lord destroys sin

MASTER (to the devotees): "As the tiger devours other animals, so does the 'tiger of zeal
for the Lord' eat up lust, anger, and the other passions. Once this zeal grows in the
heart, lust and the other passions disappear. The gopis of Vrindāvan had that state of
mind because of their zeal for Krishna.

"Again, this zeal for God is compared to collyrium. Radha said to her friends, 'I see
Krishna everywhere.' They replied, 'Friend, you have painted your eyes with the
collyrium of love; that is why you see Krishna everywhere.'
"They say that when your eyes are painted with collyrium made from the ashes of a
frog's head you see snakes everywhere.
