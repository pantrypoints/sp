The spiritual wisdom of worldly people is seen only on rare occasions. It is like the flame of a candle. No, it is rather
like a single ray of the sun passing through a chink in a wall. Worldly people chant the
name of God, but there is no zeal behind it. It is like children's swearing by God, having
learnt the word from the quarrels of their aunts.

"Worldly people have no grit. If they succeed in an undertaking, it is all right, but if they don't succeed, it scarcely bothers them at all. When they need water, they begin to dig a well. But as soon as they strike a stone, they give up digging there and begin at another place. Perhaps they come to a bed of sand. Finding nothing but sand, they give
that place up too. 

How can they succeed in getting water unless they continue to dig persistently where they started?

"Man reaps the harvest of his own past actions. Hence you read in the song:

O Mother, I have no one else to blame:
Alas! I sink in the well these very hands have dug.

"'I' and 'mine'-that is ignorance. By discriminating you will realize that what you call 'I' is really nothing but Ātman. Reason it out. Are you the body or the flesh or something else? At the end you will know that you are none of these. You are free from attributes. 

Then you will realize that you have never been the doer of any action, that you have
been free from virtue and faults alike, that you are beyond righteousness and
unrighteousness.

"From ignorance a man says, 'This is gold and this is brass.' But a man of Knowledge
says, 'It is all gold.'

"Reasoning stops when one sees God. But there are instances of people who have
realized God and who still continue to reason. Again, there are people who, even after
having seen God, chant His name with devotion and sing His glories.
"How long does a child cry? So long as it is not sucking at its mother's breast. As soon
as it is nursed it stops crying. Then the child feels only joy. Joyously it drinks the milk
from its mother's breast. But it is also true that, while drinking, the child sometimes
plays and laughs.

"It is God alone who has become everything. But in man He manifests Himself the
most. God is directly present in the man who has the pure heart of a child and who
laughs and cries and dances and sings in divine ecstasy."
By this time Sri Ramakrishna had become better acquainted with Adhar, who related the
cause of his friend's grief. The Master sang, as if to himself:
To arms! To arms, O man! Death storms your house in battle
array!

Bearing the quiver of knowledge, mount the chariot of
devotion;

Bend the bow of your tongue with the bow-string of love,
And aim at him the shaft of Mother Kāli's holy name.
Here is a ruse for the fray: You need no chariot or charioteer;
Fight your foe from the Ganges' bank, and he is easily slain.
Master consoles a bereaved father

Then he said: "What can you do? Be ready for Death. Death has entered the house.
You must fight him with the weapon of God's holy name. God alone is the Doer. I say:
'O Lord, I do as Thou doest through me. I speak as Thou speakest through me. I am
the machine and Thou art the Operator. I am the house and Thou art the Indweller. I
am the engine and Thou art the Engineer.' Give your power of attorney to God. One
doesn't come to grief through letting a good man assume one's responsibilities. Let His
will be done.

But isn't your grief for your son only natural? The son is one's own self reborn.
Lakshmana ran to Ravana when the latter fell dead on the battlefield. Looking at
Ravana's body, he found that everyone of his bones was full of holes. Thereupon he said
to Rāma: 'O Rāma, glory be to Your arrows! There is no spot in Ravana's body that they
have not pierced.' 'Brother,' replied Rāma, 'the holes you see in his bones are not from
My arrows. Grief for his sons has pierced them through and through. These holes are
the marks of his grief. It has penetrated his very bones.'

"But house, wife, and children are all transitory; they have only a momentary existence.
The palm-tree alone is real. One or two fruits have dropped off. Why lament?
"God is engaged in three kinds of activity: creation, preservation, and destruction.
Death is inevitable. All will be destroyed at the time of dissolution. Nothing will remain.
At that time the Divine Mother will gather up the seeds for the future creation, even as
the elderly mistress of the house keeps in her hotchpotch-pot little bags of cucumber
seeds, 'sea-foam', blue pills, and other miscellaneous things. The Divine Mother will
take Her seeds out again at the time of the new creation."

Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with Adhar on the verandah north of his room.

MASTER (to Adhar): "You are a deputy magistrate. Remember that you have obtained
your position through the grace of God. Do not forget Him, but remember that all men
must one day walk down the same path. We stay in the world only a couple of days.
"This world is our field of activity. We are born here to perform certain duties. People
have their homes in the country but come to Calcutta to work.

"It is necessary to do a certain amount of work. This is a kind of discipline. But one
must finish it speedily. While melting gold, the goldsmith uses everything-the bellows,
the fan, and the pipe-so that he may have the hot fire he needs to melt the metal. After
the melting is over, he relaxes and asks his attendant to prepare a smoke for him. All
this time his face has been hot and perspiring; but now he can smoke.
"One must have stern determination; then alone is spiritual practice possible. One must
make a firm resolve.

"There is great power in the seed of God's name. It destroys ignorance. A seed is
tender, and the sprout soft; still it pierces the hard ground. The ground breaks and
makes way for the sprout.

"The mind becomes very much distracted if one lives long in the midst of 'woman and
gold'. Therefore one must be very careful. But monks do not have much to fear. The
real sannyasi lives away from 'woman and gold'. Therefore through the practice of
spiritual discipline he can always fix his mind on God.

"True sannyasis, those who are able to devote their minds constantly to God, are like
bees, which light only on flowers and sip their honey. Those who live in the world, in the midst of 'woman and gold', may direct their attention to God; but sometimes their minds  dwell also on 'woman and gold'. They are like common flies, which light on a piece of candy, then on a sore or filth.

"Always keep your mind fixed on God. In the beginning you must struggle a little; later
on you will enjoy your pension."
