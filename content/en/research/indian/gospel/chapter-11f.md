A DEVOTEE : "Sir, please bless us."

MASTER: "God is in all beings. But you must apply to the Gas Company. It will connect
the storage-tank with the pipe in your house.

One must pray earnestly. It is said that one can realize God by directing to Him the combined intensity of three attractions, namely, the child's attraction for the mother, the husband's attraction for the chaste wife, and the attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly man.

## Traits of a true devotee

There are certain signs by which you can know a true devotee of God. His mind becomes quiet as he listens to his teacher's instruction, just as the poisonous snake is quieted by the music of the charmer.

I don't mean the cobra. There is another sign. A real devotee develops the power of assimilating instruction. An image cannot be
impressed on bare glass, but only on glass stained with a black solution, as in photography. The black solution is devotion to God. There is a third sign of a true devotee. The true devotee has controlled his senses. He has subdued his lust. The gopis were free from lust.

"You are talking about your leading a householder's life. Suppose you are a householder. It rather helps in the practice of spiritual discipline. It is like fighting from inside a fort. The Tantriks sometimes use a corpse in their religious rites. Now and then the dead body frightens them by opening its mouth. 

That is why they keep fried rice and grams near them, and from time to time they throw some of the grains into the
corpse's mouth. Thus pacifying the corpse, they repeat the name of the Deity without
any worry. Likewise, the householder should pacify his wife and the other members of
his family. He should provide them with food and other necessities. Thus he removes
the obstacles to his practice of spiritual discipline.

Those who still have a few worldly experiences to enjoy should lead a householder's life and pray to God. That is why Nityananda allowed the worldly to enjoy catfish soup and the warm embrace of a young woman while repeating God's name.

"But it is quite different with genuine sannyasis. 

A bee lights on flowers and on nothing else. To the chatak all water except rain is tasteless. It will drink no other water, but
looks up agape for the rain that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It drinks
only that water. 

A real sannyasi will not enjoy any kind of bliss except the Bliss of God.

The bee lights only on flowers. The real monk is like a bee, whereas the householder
devotee is like a common fly, which lights on a festering sore as well as on a sweetmeat.

You have taken so much trouble to come here. You must be seeking God. But almost everyone is satisfied simply by seeing the garden. Only one or two look for its owner. 

People enjoy the beauty of the world; they do not seek its Owner.

(Pointing to the singer) "A little while ago he sang a song describing the six centres.
These are dealt with in Yoga. There are two kinds of yoga: hathayoga and rajayoga.
The hathayogi practises physical exercises. His goal is to acquire supernatural powers:
longevity and the eight psychic powers. These are his aims. But the aim of rajayoga is
the attainment of devotion, ecstatic love, knowledge, and renunciation. Of these two,
rajayoga is the better.


## The 7 planes of the Vedas

There is much similarity between the seven 'planes' described in the Vedānta and the six 'centres' of Yoga. The first three planes of the Vedas may be compared to the first 3 Yogic centres, namely, Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura. With ordinary
people the mind dwells in these three planes, at the organs of evacuation and generation
and at the navel.

When the mind ascends to the fourth plane, the centre designated in
Yoga as Anahata, it sees the individual soul as a flame. Besides, it sees light. At this
the aspirant cries: 'Ah! What is this? Ah! What is this?'


"When the mind rises to the fifth plane, the aspirant wants to hear only about God. This
is the Visuddha centre of Yoga. The sixth plane and the centre known by the yogi as
Ajna are one and the same. When the mind rises there, the aspirant sees God. But still
there is a barrier between God and the devotee. It is like the barrier of glass in a
lantern, which keeps one from touching the light. King Janaka used to give instruction
about Brahmajnana from the fifth plane. Sometimes he dwelt on the fifth plane, and
sometimes on the sixth.
"After passing the six centres the aspirant arrives at the seventh plane. Reaching it, the
mind merges in Brahman. The individual soul and the Supreme Soul become one. The
aspirant goes into samadhi. His consciousness of the body disappears. He loses the
knowledge of the outer world. He does not see the manifold any more. His reasoning
comes to a stop.

Trailanga Swami once said that because a man reasons he is conscious of multiplicity, of variety. Attaining samadhi, one gives up the body in twenty-one days. Spiritual consciousness is not possible without the awakening of the Kundalini.

A man who has realized God shows certain characteristics. He becomes like a child or a madman, or an inert thing or a ghoul. Further, he is firmly convinced that he is the
machine and God is its Operator, that God alone is the Doer and all others are His
instruments. As some Sikh devotees once said to me, even the leaf moves because of
God's will. One should be aware that everything happens by the will of Rāma. The
weaver said: 'The price of the cloth, by the will of Rāma, is one rupee six annas. By the
will of Rāma the robbery was committed. By the will of Rāma the robbers were arrested. By the will of Rāma I too was arrested by the police. And at last, by the will of Rāma, I was released.' "


It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna had had no rest since his midday meal. He had talked
unceasingly to the devotees about God. At last the visitors took their leave and went
home.
