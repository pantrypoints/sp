"The Jnāni experiences God-Consciousness within himself; it is like the upper Ganges, flowing in only one direction. To him the whole universe is illusory, like a dream; he is always established in the Reality of Self. But with the lover of God the case is different. 

His feeling does not flow in only one direction. He feels both the ebb-tide and the flood-tide of divine emotion. He laughs and weeps and dances and sings in the ecstasy of God. The lover of God likes to sport with Him. In the Ocean of God-Consciousness he sometimes swims, sometimes goes down, and sometimes rises to the surface-like pieces of ice in the water. (Laughter.)

Brahman and Śakti are not different "The Jnāni seeks to realize Brahman. But the ideal of the bhakta is the Personal God-a God endowed with omnipotence and with the six treasures. Yet Brahman and Śakti are, in fact, not different. That which is the Blissful Mother is, again, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. 

They are like the gem and its lustre. When one speaks of the lustre of the gem, one thinks of the gem; and again, when one speaks of the gem, one refers to its lustre. One cannot conceive of the lustre of the gem without thinking of the gem, and 
one cannot conceive of the gem without thinking of its lustre.

"Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute is one, and one only. But It is associated with different limiting adjuncts on account of the different degrees of Its manifestation. That is why one finds various forms of God. The devotee sings, 'O my Divine Mother, Thou art all these!' Wherever you see actions, like creation, preservation, and dissolution, there is the manifestation of Śakti. Water is water whether it is calm or full of waves and bubbles. The Absolute alone is the Primordial Energy, which creates, preserves, and destroys. Thus it is the same 'Captain', whether he remains inactive or performs his
worship or pays a visit to the Governor General. Only we designate him by different names at different times."


CAPTAIN: "Yes, sir, that is so."

MASTER: "I said those words to Keshab Sen."

CAPTAIN: "Keshab is not an orthodox Hindu. He adopts manners and customs according
to his own whim. He is a well-to-do gentleman and not a holy man."

MASTER (to the other devotees): "Captain forbids me to go to see Keshab."

CAPTAIN: "But, sir, you act as you will. What can I do?"

MASTER (sharply): "Why shouldn't I go to see Keshab? You feel at ease when you go to
the Governor General's house, and for money at that. Keshab thinks of God and chants
His name. Isn't it you who are always saying that God Himself has become the universe
and all its living beings? Doesn't God dwell in Keshab also?"

With these words the Master left the room abruptly and went to the northeast verandah.

Captain and the other devotees remained, waiting for his return. M. accompanied the
Master to the verandah, where Narendra was talking with Hazra. Sri Ramakrishna knew
that Hazra always indulged in dry philosophical discussions. Hazra would say: "The
world is unreal, like a dream. Worship, food offerings to the Deity, and so forth, are only
hallucinations of the mind. The aim of spiritual life is to meditate on one's own real
Self." Then he would repeat, "I am He." But, with all that, he had a soft corner in his
heart for money, material things, and people's attention.

Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to Hazra and Narendra, "Hello! What are you talking
about?"

NARENDRA (smiling): "Oh, we are discussing a great many things. They are rather too
deep for others."

MASTER (with a smile): "But Pure Knowledge and Pure Love are one and the same
thing. Both lead the aspirants to the same goal. The path of love is much the easier."

Narendra quoted a song:
O Mother, make me mad with Thy love!
What need have I of knowledge or reason?
Narendra said to M. that he had been reading a book by Hamilton, who wrote: "A
learned ignorance is the end of philosophy and the beginning of religion."

MASTER (to M.): "What does that mean?"

Narendra explained the sentence in Bengali. The Master beamed with joy and said in
English, "Thank you! Thank you!" Everyone laughed at the charming way he said these
words. They knew that his English vocabulary consisted of only half a dozen words.

It was almost dusk when most of the devotees, including Narendra, took leave of the
Master. Sri Ramakrishna went out and looked at the Ganges for a few minutes from the
west porch. Two priests were bathing in preparation for the evening worship. Young
men of the village were strolling in the garden or standing on the concrete embankment,
gazing at the murmuring river. Others, perhaps more thoughtful, were walking about in
the solitude of the Panchavati.

It became dark. The maidservant lighted the lamp in Sri Ramakrishna's room and burnt
incense. The evening worship began in the twelve temples of Śiva and in the shrines of
Krishna and Kāli.

As it was the first day after the full moon, the moonlight soon flooded the tops of the
trees and temples, and touched with silver the numberless waves of the sacred river.

The Master returned to his room. After bowing to the Divine Mother, he clapped his
hands and chanted the sweet names of God. A number of holy pictures hung on the
walls of the room. Among others, there were pictures of Dhruva, Prahlada, Kāli, Radha-
Krishna, and the coronation of Rāma. The Master bowed low before the pictures and
repeated the holy names. Then he repeated the holy words, "Brahma-Ātmā-Bhagavan;
Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan; Brahma-Śakti, Śakti-Brahma; Veda, Purana, Tantra, Gitā,
Gayatri." Then he said: "I have taken refuge at Thy feet, O Divine Mother; not I, but
Thou. I am the machine and Thou art the Operator", and so on.


## Master extols Narendra

While the Master was meditating in this fashion on the Divine Mother, a few devotees,
coming in from the garden, gathered in his room. Sri Ramakrishna sat down on the
308small couch. He said to the devotees: "Narendra, Bhavanath, Rakhal , and devotees like
them belong to the group of the nityasiddhas; they are eternally free. Religious practice
on their part is superfluous. Look at Narendra. He doesn't care about anyone. One day
he was going with me in Captain's carriage. Captain wanted him to take a good seat,
but Narendra didn't even look at him. He is independent even of me. He doesn't tell me
all he knows, lest I should praise his scholarship before others. He is free from
ignorance and delusion. He has no bonds. He is a great soul. He has many good
qualities. He is expert in music, both as a singer and player, and is also a versatile
scholar. 

Again, he keeps his passions under control and says that he will never marry.
There is a close friendship between Narendra and Bhavanath; they are just like man and
woman. Narendra doesn't come here very often. That is good, for I am overwhelmed
by his presence."
