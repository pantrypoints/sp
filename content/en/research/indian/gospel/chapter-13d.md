Friday, September 7, 1883

Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking in the Master's room at half past seven in the
evening. No one else was present.

MASTER: "The other day I went to Calcutta. As I drove along the streets in the carriage,
I observed that everyone's attention was fixed on low things. Everyone was brooding
over his stomach and running after nothing but food. Everyone's mind was turned to
'woman and gold'. I saw only one or two with their attention fixed on higher things, with
their minds turned to God."

M: "The present age has aggravated this stomach-worry. Trying to imitate the English,
people have turned their attention to more luxuries; therefore their wants have also
increased."

MASTER: "What do the English think about God?"

M: "They believe in a formless God."


MASTER: "That is also one of our beliefs."


## Master's deep spiritual experiences

For a time Master and disciple remained silent. Then Sri Ramakrishna began to describe
his experiences of Brahman.

MASTER: "One day I had the vision of Consciousness, non-dual and indivisible. At first it
had been revealed to me that there were innumerable men, animals, and other
creatures. Among them there were aristocrats, the English, the Muslims, myself,
scavengers, dogs, and also a bearded Mussalman with an earthenware tray of rice in his
hand. He put a few grains of rice into everybody's mouth. I too tasted a little.

"Another day I saw rice, vegetables, and other food-stuff, and filth and dirt as well, lying
around. Suddenly the soul came out of my body and, like a flame, touched everything.
It was like a protruding tongue of fire and tasted everything once, even the excreta. It
was revealed to me that all these are one Substance, the non-dual and indivisible
Consciousness.

"Another day it was revealed to me that I had devotees-my intimate companions, my
very own. Thereafter I would climb to the roof of the kuthi as soon as the bells and the
conch-shells of the evening service sounded in the temples, and cry out with a longing
heart: 'Oh, where are you all? Come here! I am dying to see you!'

(To M.) "Well, what do you think of these visions?"

M: "God sports through you. This I have realized, that you are the instrument and God
is the Master. God has created other beings as if with a machine, but yourself with His
own hands."

MASTER: "Well, Hazra says that after the vision of God one acquires the six divine
powers."

M: "Those who seek pure love don't want powers."

MASTER: "Perhaps Hazra was a poor man in his previous life, and that is why he wants
so much to see the manifestation of power. He wants to know what I talk about with the
cook. 

He says to me: 'You don't have to talk to the cook. I shall talk to the manager of
the temple myself and see that you get everything you want.' (M. laughs aloud.) He
talks to me that way and I say nothing."

M: "Many a time you have said that a devotee, who loves God for the sake of love does
not care to see God's powers. A true devotee wants to see God as Gopala. In the
beginning God becomes the magnet, and the devotee the needle. But in the end the
devotee himself becomes the magnet, and God the needle; that is to say, God becomes
small to His devotee."

MASTER: "Yes, it is just like the sun at dawn. You can easily look at that sun. It doesn't
dazzle the eyes; rather it satisfies them. God becomes tender for the sake of His
devotees. He appears before them, setting aside His powers."

Both remained silent for some time.

M: "Why should your visions not be real? If they are unreal, then the world is still more
unreal; for there is only one mind that is the instrument of perception. Your pure mind
sees those visions, and our ordinary minds see worldly objects."

MASTER: "I see that you have grasped the idea of unreality. Well, tell me what you
think of Hazra."

M: "Oh, I don't know." (The Master laughs.)

MASTER: "Well, do you find me to be like anybody else?"


M: "No, sir."

MASTER: "Like any other paramahamsa?"


M: "No, sir. You can't be compared to anybody else."

MASTER (smiling): "Have you heard of a tree called the 'achina'?"

M: "No, sir."

MASTER: "There is a tree called by that name. But nobody knows what it is."

M: "Likewise, it is not possible to recognize you. The more a man understands you, the more uplifted he will be."

M. was silent. He said to himself: "The Master referred to 'the sun at dawn' and 'the tree
unrecognizable by man'. Did he mean an Incarnation of God? Is this the play of God
through man? Is the Master himself an Incarnation? Was this why he cried to the
devotees from the roof of the kuthi: 'Where are you? Come to me!'?"

Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the southeast verandah of the Kāli temple.
Rakhal, M., and Hazra were with him. He talked light-heartedly about his boyhood days.
When it was dusk he returned to his room and sat down on the small couch. Soon he
went into samādhi and in that state began to talk to the Divine Mother. He said:
"Mother, what is all this row about? Shall I go there? I shall go if You take me." The
Master was to go to a devotee's house. Was it for this that he was asking the Divine
Mother's permission?

Again he spoke to Her, perhaps praying about an intimate disciple:

"Mother, please make him stainless. Well, Mother, why have You given him only a
particle?" Remaining silent a moment, he said: "Oh, I see. That will be enough for Your
work."
