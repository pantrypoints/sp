MASTER (to M.): "Once I thought, 'Why should I be one-sided?' Therefore I was initiated into Vaishnavism in Vrindāvan and took the garb of a Vaishnava monk. I spent 3 days practising the Vaishnava discipline. Again, at Dakshineswar I was initiated into the mystery of Rāmā worship. I painted my forehead with a long mark and put on a string
with a diamond round my neck. But after a few days I gave them up.

"A certain man had a tub. People would come to him to have their clothes dyed. The
tub contained a solution of dye. Whatever colour a man wanted for his cloth, he would
get by dipping the cloth in the tub. One man was amazed to see this and said to the
dyer, 'Please give me the dye you have in your tub.' "

Was the Master hinting that people professing different religions would come to him and
have their spiritual consciousness awakened according to their own ideals?
MASTER (to Balarām's father): "Don't read books any more. But you may read books on
devotion, such as the life of Chaitanya.

"The whole thing is to love God and taste His sweetness. He is sweetness and the
devotee is its enjoyer. The devotee drinks the sweet Bliss of God. Further, God is the
lotus and the devotee the bee. The devotee sips the honey of the lotus.

As a devotee cannot live without God, so also God cannot live without His devotee.
Then the devotee becomes the sweetness, and God its enjoyer. The devotee becomes
the lotus, and God the bee. It is the Godhead that has become these two in order to
enjoy Its own Bliss. That is the significance of the episode of Radha and Krishna.
"At the beginning of spiritual life the devotee should observe such rites as pilgrimage,
putting a string of beads around his neck, and so forth. But outward ceremonies
gradually drop off as he attains the goal, the vision of God. Then his only activity is the
repetition of God's name, and contemplation and meditation on Him.

"The pennies equivalent to sixteen rupees make a great heap. But sixteen silver coins
do not look like such a big amount. Again, the quantity becomes much smaller when
you change the sixteen rupees into one gold mohur. And if you change the gold into a
tiny piece of diamond, people hardly notice it."

Orthodox Vaishnavas insist on the outer insignia of religion. They criticize any devotee
who does not wear these marks. Was that why the Master said that, after the vision of
God, a devotee becomes indifferent to outer marks, giving up formal worship when the
goal of spiritual life is attained?

MASTER (to Balarām's father): "The Kartabhajas group the devotees into four classes:
the pravartaka, the sadhaka, the siddha, and the siddha of the siddha. The pravartaka,
the beginner, puts the mark of his religion on his forehead, wears a string of beads
around his neck, and observes other outer conventions. The sadhaka, the struggling
devotee, does not care so much for elaborate rites. An example of this class is the
Baul. The siddha, the perfect, firmly believes that God exists. The siddha of the siddha,
the supremely perfect, like Chaitanya, not only has realized God but also has become
intimate with Him and talks with Him all the time. This is the last limit of realization.
Different classes of spiritual aspirants

"There are many kinds of spiritual aspirants. Those endowed with sattva perform their
spiritual practices secretly. They look like ordinary people, but they meditate inside the
mosquito net.

"Aspirants endowed with rajas exhibit outward pomp-a string of beads around the neck,
a mark on the forehead, an ochre robe, a silk cloth, a rosary with a gold bead, and so
on. They are like stall-keepers advertising their wares with signboards.

"All religions and all paths call upon their followers to pray to one and the same God.
Therefore one should not show disrespect to any religion or religious opinion. It is God
alone who is called Satchidananda Brahman in the Vedas, Satchidananda Krishna in the
Puranas, and Satchidananda Śiva in the Tantras. It is one and the same Satchidananda.
"There are different sects of Vaishnavas. That which is called Brahman in the Vedas is
called Ālekh-Niranjan by one Vaishnava sect. 'Ālekh' means That which cannot be pointed out or perceived by the sense-organs. According to this sect, Radha and Krishna
are only two bubbles of the Ālekh.

"According to the Vedānta, there is no Incarnation of God. The Vedantists say that
Rāmā and Krishna are but two waves in the Ocean of Satchidananda.
"In reality there are not two. There is only One. A man may call on God by any name;
if he is sincere in his prayer he will certainly reach Him. He will succeed if he has
longing."

As Sri Ramakrishna spoke these words to the devotees, he was overwhelmed with divine
fervour. Coming down to partial consciousness of the world, he said to Balarām's father,
"Are you the father of Balarām?"
All sat in silence. Balarām's aged father was silently telling his beads.

## Futility of worship without yearning

MASTER (to M. and the others): "Well, these people practise so much japa and go to so
many sacred places, but why are they like this? Why, do they make no progress? In their
case it seems as if the year consists of eighteen months.

"Once I said to Harish: 'What is the use of going to Benares if one does not feel restless
for God? And if one feels that longing, then this very place is Benares.'

"They make so many pilgrimages and repeat the name of God so much, but why do they
not realize anything? It is because they have no longing for God. God reveals Himself to
the devotee if only he calls upon Him with a longing heart.

"At the beginning of a yatra performance much light-hearted restlessness is to be
observed on the stage. At that time one does not see Krishna. Next the sage Nārada
enters with his flute and sings longingly, 'O Govinda! O my Life! O my Soul!' Then
Krishna can no longer remain away and appears with the cowherd boys."
