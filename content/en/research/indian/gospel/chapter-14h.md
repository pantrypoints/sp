MASTER: "It is difficult to lead the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment. Once
Pratap said to me: 'Sir, we follow the example of King Janaka. He led the life of a
householder in a detached spirit. We shall follow him.' I said to him: 'Can one be like
King Janaka by merely wishing it? How many austerities he practised in order to acquire
divine knowledge! He practised the most intense form of asceticism for many years and
only then returned to the life of the world.'

"Is there, then, no hope for householders? Certainly there is. They must practise
spiritual discipline in solitude for some days. Thus they will acquire knowledge and
devotion. Then it will not hurt them to lead the life of the world. But when you practise
discipline in solitude, keep yourself entirely away from your family. You must not allow
your wife, son, daughter, mother, father, sister, brother, friends, or relatives near you.
While thus practising discipline in solitude, you should think: 'I have no one else in the
world. God is my all.' You must also pray to Him, with tears in your eyes, for knowledge
and devotion.

"If you ask me how long you should live in solitude away from your family, I should say
that it would be good for you if you could spend even one day in such a manner. Three
days at a time are still better. One may live in solitude for twelve days, a month, three
months, or a year, according to one's convenience and ability. One hasn't much to fear
if one leads the life of a householder after attaining knowledge and devotion.

"If you break a jack-fruit after rubbing your hands with oil, then its sticky milk will not
smear your hands. While playing the game of hide-and-seek, you are safe if you but
once touch the 'granny'. Be turned into gold by touching the philosopher's stone. After
that you may remain buried underground a thousand years; when you are taken out you
will still be gold.

"The mind is like milk. If you keep the mind in the world, which is like water, then the
milk and water will get mixed. That is why people keep milk in a quiet place and let it
set into curd, and then churn butter from it. Likewise, through spiritual discipline
practised in solitude, churn the butter of knowledge and devotion from the milk of the
347mind. Then that butter can easily be kept in the water of the world. It will not get
mixed with the world. The mind will float detached on the water of the world."
Vijay had just returned from Gaya, where he had spent a long time in solitude and holy
company. He had put on the ochre robe of a monk and was in an exalted state of mind,
always indrawn. He was sitting before the Master with his head bent down, as if
absorbed in some deep thought.

Casting his benign glance on Vijay, the Master said: "Vijay, have you found your room?
"Let me tell you a parable: Once two holy men, in the course of their wanderings,
entered a city. One of them, with wondering eyes and mouth agape, was looking at the
market-place, the stalls, and the buildings, when he met his companion. The latter said:
'You seem to be filled with wonder at the city. Where is your baggage?' He replied: 'First
of all I found a room. I put my things in it, locked the door, and felt totally relieved.
Now I am going about the city enjoying all the fun.'

"So I am asking you, Vijay, if you have found your room. (To M. and the others) You
see, the spring in Vijay's heart has been covered all these days. Now it is open. . .

(To V ijay) "Well, Shivanath is always in trouble and turmoil. He has to write for
magzines and perform many other duties. Worldly duties bring much worry and anxiety
along with them.

"It is narrated in the Bhagavata that the Avadhuta had twenty-four gurus, one of whom
was a kite. In a certain place the fishermen were catching fish. A kite swooped down
and snatched a fish. At the sight of the fish, about a thousand crows chased the kite
and made a great noise with their cawing. Whichever way the kite flew with the fish, the
crows followed it. The kite flew to the south and the crows followed it there. The kite
flew to the north and still the crows followed after it. The kite went east and west, but
with the same result. As the kite began to fly about in confusion, lo, the fish dropped
from its mouth. The crows at once let the kite alone and flew after the fish. Thus
relieved of its worries, the kite sat on the branch of a tree and thought: 'That wretched
fish was at the root of all my troubles. I have now got rid of it and therefore I am at
peace.'

"The Avadhuta learnt this lesson from the kite, that as long as a man has the fish, that
is, worldly desires, he must perform actions and consequently suffer from worry,
anxiety, and restlessness. No sooner does he renounce these desires than his activities
fall away and he enjoys peace of soul.

"But work without any selfish motive is good. It does not create any worry. But it is
very difficult to be totally unselfish. We may think that our work is selfless, but
selfishness comes, unknown to us, from no one knows where. But if a man has already
undergone great spiritual discipline, then as a result of it he may be able to do work
without any selfish motive. After the vision of God a man can easily do unselfish work.

In most cases action drops away after the attainment of God. Only a few, like Nārada,
work to bring light to mankind.

"The Avadhuta accepted a bee as another teacher. Bees accumulate their honey by days
of hard labour. But they cannot enjoy their honey, for a man soon breaks the comb and
takes it away. The Avadhuta learnt this lesson from the bees, that one should not lay
things up. Sādhus should depend one hundred per cent on God. They must not gather
for the morrow. But this does not apply to the householder. He must bring up his
family; therefore it is necessary for him to provide. Birds and monks do not hoard. Yet
birds also hoard after their chicks are hatched: they collect food in their beaks for their
young ones.

"Let me tell you one thing, Vijay. Don't trust a sādhu if he keeps bag, and baggage with
him and a bundle of clothes with many knots. I have seen such sādhus under the
banyan tree in the Panchavati. Two or three of them were seated there. One was
picking over lentils, some were sewing their clothes, and all were gossiping about a feast
they had enjoyed in a rich man's house. They said among themselves, 'That rich man
spent a hundred thousand rupees on the feast and fed the sādhus sumptuously with
cake, sweets, and many such delicious things.' " (All laugh)

VIJAY: "It is true, sir. "I have seen such sādhus at Gaya. They are called the lotawalla
sādhus of Gaya."

MASTER (to Vijay): "When love of God is awakened, work drops away of itself. If God
makes some men work, let them work. It is now time for you to give up everything.

Renounce all and say, 'O mind, may you and I alone behold the Mother, letting no One
else intrude.' "

Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna began to sing in his soul-enthralling voice:

Cherish my precious Mother Syama
Tenderly within, O mind;
May you and I alone behold Her,
Letting no one else intrude.
O mind, in solitude enjoy Her,
Keeping the passions all outside;
Take but the tongue, that now and again
It may cry out, "O Mother! Mother!"
Suffer no breath of base desire
To enter and approach us there,
But bid true knowledge stand on guard,
Alert and watchful evermore.

The Master said to Vijay: "Surrender yourself completely to God, and set aside all such
things as fear and shame. Give up such feelings as, 'What will people think of me if I
349dance in the ecstasy of God's holy name?' The saying, 'One cannot have the vision of
God as long as one has these three- shame, hatred, and fear', is very true. Shame,
hatred, fear, caste, pride, secretiveness, and the like are so many bonds. Man is free
when he is liberated from all these.

"When bound by ties one is jiva, and when free from ties one is Śiva. Prema, ecstatic
love of God, is a rare thing.

## Steps of bhakti

"First of all one acquires bhakti. Bhakti is single-minded devotion to God, like the
devotion a wife feels for her husband. It is very difficult to have unalloyed devotion to
God. Through such devotion one's mind and soul merge in Him.

"Then comes bhava, intense love. Through bhava a man becomes speechless. His
nerve currents are stilled. Kumbhaka comes by itself. It is like the case of a man whose
breath and speech stop when he fires a gun.

"But prema, ecstatic love, is an extremely rare thing. Chaitanya had that love. When
one has prema one forgets all outer things. One forgets the world. One even forgets
one's own body, which is so dear to a man."

The Master began to sing:
Oh, when will dawn the blessed day
When tears of joy will flow from my eyes
As I repeat Lord Hari's name?
Oh, when will dawn the blessed day
When all my craving for the world
Will vanish straightway from my heart,
And with the thrill of His holy name
All of my hair will stand on end?
Oh, when will dawn that blessed day?

So the talk of divine things was proceeding, when some invited Brahmo devotees
entered the room. There were among them a few pundits and high government officials.
Sri Ramakrishna had said that bhava stills the nerve currents of the devotee. He
continued: "When Arjuna was about to shoot at the target, the eye of a fish, his eyes
were fixed on the eye of the fish, and on nothing else. He didn't even notice any part of
the fish except the eye. In such a state the breathing stops and one experiences
kumbhaka.

"Another characteristic of God-vision is that a great spiritual current rushes up along the
spine and goes toward the brain. If then the devotee goes into samādhi, he sees God."
Looking at the Brahmo devotees who had just arrived, the Master said: "Mere pundits,
devoid of divine love, talk incoherently. Pundit Samadhyayi once said, in the course of
350his sermon: 'God is dry. Make Him sweet by your love and devotion.' Imagine! To
describe Him, as dry, whom the Vedas declare as the Essence of Bliss! It makes one feel
that the pundit didn't know what God really is. That was why his words were so
incoherent.

"A man once said, 'There are many horses in my uncle's cow-shed.' From that one could
know that the man had no horses at all. No one keeps a horse in a cow-shed.
Transitoriness of earthly things

"Some people pride themselves on their riches and power-their wealth, honour, and
social position. But these are only transitory. Nothing will remain with you in death.
"There is a song that runs:

Remember this, O mind! Nobody is your own:
Vain is your wandering in this world.
Trapped in the subtle snare of maya as you are,
Do not forget the Mother's name.
Only a day or two men honour you on earth
As lord and master; all too soon
That form, so honoured now, must needs be cast away,
When Death, the Master, seizes you.
Even your beloved wife, for whom, while yet you live,
You fret yourself almost to death,
Will not go with you then; she too will say farewell,
And shun your corpse as an evil thing.

"One must not be proud of one's money. If you say that you are rich, then one can
remind you that there are richer men than you, and others richer still, and so on. At
dusk the glow-worm comes out and thinks that it lights the world. But its pride is
crushed when the stars appear in the sky. The stars feel that they give light to the
earth. But when the moon rises the stars fade in shame. The moon feels that the world
smiles at its light and that it lights the earth. Then the eastern horizon becomes red,
and the sun rises. The moon fades and after a while is no longer seen.

"If wealthy people would think that way, they would get rid of their pride in their
wealth."

Manilal had provided a sumptuous feast in celebration of the festival. He entertained the
Master and the other guests with great love and attention. It was late at night when
they returned to their homes.
