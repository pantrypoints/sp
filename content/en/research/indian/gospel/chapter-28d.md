(To Hazra) "If there is knowledge of one, there is also knowledge of many. What will you achieve by mere study of the scriptures? The scriptures contain a mixture of sand and sugar, as it were. It is extremely difficult to separate the sugar from the sand. 

Therefore one should learn the essence of the scriptures from the teacher or from a sādhu.
Afterwards what does one care for books?

(To the devotees) "Gather all the information and then plunge in. Suppose a pot has
dropped in a certain part of a lake. Locate the spot and dive there.

"One should learn the essence of the scriptures from the guru and then practise
sadhana. If one rightly follows spiritual discipline, then one directly sees God. The
discipline is said to be rightly followed only when one plunges in. What will a man gain
by merely reasoning about the words of the scriptures? Ah, the fools! They reason
themselves to death over information about the path. They never take the plunge. What
a pity!

"You may say, even though you dive deep you are still in danger of sharks and
crocodiles, of lust and anger. But dive after rubbing your body with turmeric powder;
then sharks and crocodiles will not come near you. The turmeric is discrimination and
renunciation.


## Master's spiritual practice

(To the devotees) "God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths. First
according to the Purana, then according to the Tantra. I also followed the disciplines of
the Vedas. At first I practised sadhana in the Panchavati. I made a grove of tulsi-plants
and used to sit inside it and meditate. Sometimes I cried with a longing Heart, 'Mother!
Mother!' Or I again, 'Rāma! Rāma!'

"While repeating the name of Rāma, I sometimes assumed the attitude of Hanuman and
fixed a tail to the lower end of my backbone. I was in a God-intoxicated state. At that time I used to put on a silk robe and worship the Deity. What joy I experienced in that worship!

"I practised the discipline of the Tantra under the bel-tree. At that time I could see no
distinction between the sacred tulsi and any other plant. In that state I sometimes ate
the leavings from a jackal's meal, food that had been exposed the whole night, part of which might have been eaten by snakes or other creatures. Yes, I ate that stuff.

"Sometimes I rode on a dog and fed him with luchi, also eating part of the bread myself.
I realized that the whole world was filled with God alone. One cannot have spiritual
realization without destroying ignorance; so I would assume the attitude of a tiger and
devour ignorance.

"While practising the disciplines of the Vedas, I became a sannyasi. I used to lie down in
the chandni and say to Hriday: 'I am a sannyasi. I shall take my meals here.'

"I vowed to the Divine Mother that I would kill myself if I did not see God. I said to Her:

'O Mother, I am a fool. Please teach me what is contained in the Vedas, the Puranas, the
Tantras, and the other scriptures.' The Mother said to me, 'The essence of the Vedānta is
that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory.'The Satchidananda Brahman described
in the Vedas is the Satchidananda Śiva of the Tantra and the Satchidananda Krishna of
the Purana. The essence of the Gitā is what you get by repeating the word ten times. It
is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation.

"After the realization of God, how far below lie the Vedas, the Vedānta, the Purana, the
Tantra! (To Hazra) I cannot utter the word 'Om' in samādhi. Why is that? I cannot say
'Om' unless I come down very far from the state of samādhi.

"I had all the experiences that one should have, according to the scriptures, after one's
direct perception of God. I behaved like a child, like a madman, like a ghoul, and like an
inert thing.

"I saw the visions described in the scriptures. Sometimes I saw the universe filled with
sparks of fire. Sometimes I saw all the quarters glittering with light, as if the world were
a lake of mercury. Sometimes I saw the world as if made of liquid silver. Sometimes,
again, I saw all the quarters illumined as if with the light of Raman candles. So you see
my experiences tally with those described in the scriptures.

"It was revealed to me further that God Himself has become the universe and all its
living beings and the twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like the process of evolution and
involution.

"Oh, what a state God kept me in at that time! One experience would hardly be over
before another overcame me. It was like the movement of the husking-machine: no
sooner is one end down than the other goes up.

"I would see God in meditation, in the state of samādhi, and I would see the same God
when my mind came back to the outer world. When looking at this side of the mirror I
would see Him alone, and when looking on the reverse side I saw the same God."
The devotees listened to these words with rapt attention.

(To the Mukherji brothers) "Captain is now really in the state of the sadhaka. That the
mere possession of wealth should create, attachment is by no means true. Sambhu Mallick used to say to Hriday, 'Hridu, I have packed my things and am ready for the journey.' 

I said to him: 'God forbid! Why do you say such ominous words?' 'No', replied Sambhu. 'Please bless me that I may cast aside all these possessions and go to God.' 

"God's devotees have nothing to fear. They are His own He always stands by them. Once Duryodhana and his brothers were imprisoned by the gandharvas. It was Yudhisthira who freed them. Yudhisthira said, 'If our relatives are placed in such a plight, then it is our disgrace.' "

It was 9pm. The Mukherji brothers were ready to return to Calcutta. The Master left his seat and began to pace the room and the porch. He could hear the kirtan sung in the Vishnu temple. A devotee said that Harish and Lātu were in the singing party.

Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees went to the Vishnu temple and saluted the Deity. The brahmins belonging to the staff of the temple garden, and also the priests, the cooks, and the servants, were singing the kirtan. He stood there a few minutes and encouraged the singers. On the way back to his room he remarked to the devotees, "You see, some of them polish the metal utensils and some go to houses of prostitution."

The Master returned to his room and took his seat. Presently the singers came and bowed low before him. The Master said to them: "One should perspire, dancing and singing the name of God, as people do earning money. I had thought of joining you in the dancing; but I found that you did everything very well. You had flavoured the curry with all the seasoning. What could I add? It will be nice if you sing devotional songs that way now and then."

The Mukherji brothers saluted the Master. Their carriage was ready near the verandah north of the room. The Master stood facing the north. On his left was the Ganges; in front of him were the nahabat, the garden, and the kuthi; and to his right was the road leading to the gate. The night was dark, and a devotee had brought a lantern to show the visitors their way. One by one the devotees bowed and took the dust of the Master's feet. The carriage seemed too heavily loaded for the horses. The Master said, "Aren't there too many people in the carriage?"

Sri Ramakrishna remained standing. As the carriage rolled away, the devotees looked back at the Master's face beaming with compassion and love.
