Sunday, September 21, 1884

A large number of devotees were in Sri Ramakrishna's room, among them Ram,
Mahendra Mukherji, M., and Chunilal. Chunilal had just returned from Vrindāvan, where
he had gone with Rakhal and Balarām. The two latter were still there. Nityagopal also
was staying there. The Master began to talk with Chunilal about Vrindāvan.

MASTER: "How is Rakhal?"

CHUNI: "He is quite well now, sir."

MASTER: "Isn't Nityagopal coming back?"

CHUNI: "He was still there when I left."

MASTER: "Who will bring your family back?"

CHUNI: "Balarām Babu told me he would arrange it with some reliable person. He didn't
mention any name."


## Master praises Narayan

Sri Ramakrishna then spoke to Mahendra Mukherji about Narayan, a school-boy sixteen
or seventeen years old, who often visited the Master and was very dear to him.

MASTER: "He is quite guileless, isn't he?"
The very uttering of the word "guileless" filled the Master with great joy.

MAHENDRA: "Yes, sir. Completely guileless."

MASTER: "His mother came here the other day. I was a little frightened to see that she
was a proud woman. That day she found that Captain, you, and many others, too,
visited me. Then she must have realized that she and her son were not the only people
to come here. (All laugh.) There was some sugar candy in the room and she remarked
that it was good. That made her feel there was no scarcity of food here. I happened to
tell Baburam, in front of her, to keep some sweets for himself and Naran. Ganu's mother
said that Naran always bothered his mother for the boat hire to come here. His mother
said to me, 'Please ask Naran to consent to marry.' I replied, 'All that depends on one's
fate.' Why should I interfere? (All laugh.) Naran is indifferent to his studies. His mother
said, 'Please ask him to pay a little more attention.' So I said to Naran, 'Attend to your
studies.' Then his mother said, 'Please tell him seriously.' (All laugh.)

(To Chunilal) "Why doesn't Gopal come here?"

CHUNILAL: "He has been suffering from dysentery."

MASTER: "Is he taking any medicine?"

Sri Ramakrishna was planning to go to a performance of the Chaitanyalila at the Star
Theatre. Mahendra Mukherji was to take him to Calcutta in his carriage. They were
talking about choosing good seats. Some suggested that one could see the performance
well from the one-rupee gallery. Ram said, "Oh, no! I shall engage a box for him." The
Master laughed. Some of the devotees said that public women took part in the play.
They took the parts of Nimai, Nitai, and others.

MASTER (to the devotees): "I shall look upon them as the Blissful Mother Herself. What
if one of them acts the part of Chaitanya? An imitation custard-apple reminds one of the
real fruit. Once, while going along a road, a devotee of Krishna noticed some babla-
trees. Instantly his mind was thrown into ecstasy. He remembered that the wood of
babla-trees was used for the handles of the spades that the garden of the temple of
Syamasundar was dug with. The trees instantly reminded him of Krishna. I was once
taken to the Maidan in Calcutta to see a balloon go up. There I noticed a young English
boy leaning against a tree, with his body bent in three places. It at once brought before
me the vision of Krishna and I went into samādhi.

"Once Chaitanyadeva was passing through a village. Someone told him that the body of
the drum used in the kirtan was made from the earth of that village, and at once he
went into ecstasy.

"Radha could not control herself at the sight of a cloud or the blue throat of a peacock. It
would at once awaken in her mind the thought of Krishna, and she would go into
ecstasy."

The Master was silent a few moments and then resumed the conversation.

MASTER: "Radha had attained mahabhava. There was no desire behind the ecstatic love
of the gopis. A true lover does not seek anything from God. He prays only for pure love.
He doesn't want any powers or miracles.


## Occult powers


"It is very troublesome to possess occult powers. Nangta taught me this by a story. A
man who had acquired occult powers was sitting on the seashore when a storm arose. It
caused him great discomfort; so he said, 'Let the storm stop.' His words could not
remain unfulfilled. At that moment a ship was going full sail before the wind. When the
storm ceased abruptly the ship capsized and sank. The passengers perished and the sin
of causing their death fell to the man. And because of that sin he lost his occult powers
and went to hell.

"Once upon a time a sādhu acquired great occult powers. He was vain about them. But
he was a good man and had some austerities to his credit. One day the Lord, disguised
as a holy man, came to him and said, 'Revered sir, I have heard that you have great
occult powers.'

The sādhu received the Lord cordially and offered him a seat. Just then
an elephant passed by. The Lord, in the disguise of the holy man, said to the sādhu,
'Revered sir, can you kill this elephant if you like?' The sādhu said, 'Yes, it is possible.'

So saying, he took a pinch of dust, muttered some mantras over it, and threw it at the
elephant. The beast struggled awhile in pain and then dropped dead. The Lord said:
'What power you have! You have killed the elephant!' The sādhu laughed. Again the Lord
spoke: 'Now can you revive the elephant?' 'That too is possible', replied the sādhu. He
threw another pinch of charmed dust at the beast. The elephant writhed about a litle and
came back to life. Then the Lord said: 'Wonderful is your power. But may I ask you one
thing? You have killed the elephant and you have revived it. But what has that done for
you? Do you feel uplifted by it? Has it enabled you to realize God?' Saying this the Lord
vanished.

"Subtle are the ways of dharma. One cannot realize God if one has even the least trace
of desire. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fibre
sticking out.

"Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, if you want to realize Me, you will not succeed if you
have even one of the eight occult powers.' This is the truth. Occult power is sure to
beget pride, and pride makes one forget God.

"Once a cross-eyed rich man came here. He said to me: 'You are a paramahamsa. That
is good. You must perform a swastyayana ceremony for me.' What a small-minded
person he was! He called me a paramahamsa and yet wanted me to perform that
ceremony. To secure welfare by means of the swastyayana is to exercise occult power.
"An egotistic person cannot realize God. Do you know what egotism is like? It is like a
high mound, where rain-water cannot collect: the water runs off. Water collects in low
land. There seeds sprout and grow into trees. Then the trees bear fruit.

"Therefore I say to Hazra, 'Never think that you alone have true understanding and that
others are fools.' One must love all. No one is a stranger. It is Hari alone who dwells in
all beings. Nothing exists without Him.

"The Lord said to Prahlada, 'Ask a boon of Me.' 'I have seen You', replied Prahlada. 'That
is enough. I don't need anything else.' But the Lord insisted. Thereupon Prahlada said, 'If
You must give me a boon, let it be that those who have tortured me may not have to
suffer punishment.' The meaning of those words is that it was God who tortured
Prahlada in the form of his persecutors, and, if they suffered punishment, it would really
be God who suffered.
