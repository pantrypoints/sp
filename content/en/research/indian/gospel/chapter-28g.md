"I have realized that Brahman and Śakti are identical, like water and its wetness, like fire
and its power to burn. Brahman dwells in all beings as the Bibhu, the All-pervasive
Consciousness, though Its manifestation is greater in some places than in others. Hazra
says, further, that anyone who realizes God must also acquire God's supernatural
powers; that he possesses these powers, though he may or may not use them."

M: "Yes, one must have control over these supernatural powers!" (All laugh)

MASTER (smiling): "Yes, one must have them in one's grasp! How mean! He who has
never enjoyed power and riches becomes impatient for them. But a true devotee never
prays to God for them."

Sri Ramakrishna washed his face. A smoke was prepared for him. He said to M.: "Is. it
dusk now? If it is, I won't smoke. During the twilight hour of the dusk you should give up
all other activities and remember God." Saying this he looked at the hairs on his arm. He
wanted to see whether he could count them. If he could not, it would be dusk.


## Master at Star Theatre

About half past eight in the evening the carriage with the Master and the devotees drew
up in front of the Star Theatre on Beadon Street. He was accompanied by M., Baburam,
Mahendra and two or three others. They were talking about engaging seats, when Girish
Chandra Ghosh, the manager of the theatre, accompanied by several officials, came out
to the carriage, greeted the Master, and took him and the party upstairs. Girish had
heard of the Master and was very glad to see him at the theatre. The Master was
conducted to one of the boxes. M. sat next to him; Baburam and one or two devotees
sat behind.

The hall was brilliantly lighted. The Master looked down at the pit and saw that it was
crowded. The boxes also were full. For every box there was a man to fan those who
occupied it. Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said to M., with his childlike smile:

"Ah, it is very nice here! I am glad to have come. I feel inspired when I see so many
people together. Then I clearly perceive that God Himself has become everything."

M: "It is true, sir."

MASTER: "How much will they charge us here?"

M: "They won't take anything. They are very happy that you have come to the theatre."

MASTER: "It is all due to the grace of the Divine Mother."

The Chaitanyalila was about to be performed. It was a play about the early life of Sri
Chaitanya, who was also known as Nimai, Gaur, Gora, and Gaurānga. The curtain rose;
the attention of the audience was fixed on the stage.

The first scene depicts a council of Sin and the Six Passions. On a forest path behind
them walk Viveka, Vairāgya, and Bhakti, engaged in conversation.

Bhakti says to her companions: "Gaurānga is born in Nadia. Therefore the vidyadharis,
the munis, and the rishis have come down to earth in disguise to pay their respects to
him."

She sings:
Blest indeed is the earth! Gora is born in Nadia!

Behold the vidyadharis, coming in chariots toadore him;

Behold the munis and rishis, who come, allured by the spell of Love.
The vidyadharis, munis, and rishis sing a hymn to Gaurānga and adore him as
an Incarnation of God.

Sri Ramakrishna watched the scene and was overpowered with divine ecstasy. He said to

M.: "Look at it! Ah! Ah!"

Sages: O Kesava, bestow Thy grace
Upon Thy luckless servants here!

O Kesava, who dost delight
To roam Vrindāvan's glades and groves!
Goddesses: O Madhava, our mind's Bewitcher!
Sweet One, who dost steal our hearts,
Sweetly playing On Thy flute!
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!
Sages: O Thou Eternal Youth of Braja,
Tamer of fierce Kaliya,
Slayer of the afflicted's fear!

Goddesses: Beloved with the arching eyes
And crest with arching peacock feather,
Charmer of Sri Radha's heart!
Sages: Govardhan's mighty Lifter, Thou,
All garlanded with sylvan flowers!
O Damodara, Kamsa's Scourge!
Goddesses: O Dark One, who dost sport in bliss
With sweet Vrindāvan's gopi maids.
Chorus: Chant, O mind, the name of Hari,
Sing aloud the name of Hari,
Praise Lord Hari's name!

As the vidyadharis sang the lines, Beloved with the arching eyes; And crest with arching
peacock feather!, the Master went into deep samādhi. The orchestra played on, but he
was not aware of the outer world.

Another scene: A guest has arrived at the house of Jagannath Misra, Nimai's father. The
boy Nimai plays about, singing with his friends, in a happy mood:
Tell Me, where is My blessed Vrindāvan?

Where is Mother Yaśoda?

Where Father Nanda and Brother Balai?
Where My twin cows, black and white?
Tell Me, where is My magic flute?
My friends Sudāmā and Sridāmā?
Where My Jamuna's bank, My banyan?
Where My beloved gopi maids?
Where is Radha, queen of My heart?

The guest closes his eyes while offering food to the Lord. Nimai runs to him. and eats the
food from the plate. The guest recognizes Nimai as an Incarnation of God and seeks to
please him with the Hymn of the Ten Incarnations. Before taking leave of Gaurānga's
parents he sings:

Glory to Gora, the Source of Bliss!
Hail Gaurānga, Redeemer of earth!
Help of the helpless, Life of the living,
Slayer of fear in the hearts of the fearful!
Age after age we see Thy play

New sports unfolding, moods ever new;
New waves rolling, new tales to be told.
Thou who bearest the whole world's burden,
Shower on us the nectar of Love!
Take away our grief and affliction:
602Thou in Love's pleasure-cave dost dwell.
Hope of the suffering! Chastiser of sin!
Scourge of the wicked! Victory to Thee!
Listening to the hymn, the Master was thrilled with ecstasy.

The next scene is at Navadvip on the bank of the Ganges. After bathing in the holy
water, the brahmin men and women engage in worship by the riverside. As they close
their eyes, Nimai steals their food offerings and begins to eat them. A brahmin loses his
temper and says: "You scapegrace! You rascal! You are taking away my offering for
Vishnu. Ruin will seize you." Nimai holds on to the offering and is about to run away.
Many of the women love him dearly and cannot bear to have him go away. They call to
him: "Return, O Nimai! Come back, O Nimai!" Nimai turns a deaf ear to them.
One of the women, however, knows the irresistible charm that will bring him back. She
loudly chants the name of Hari. Immediately he repeats the name of Hari and comes
back.

M. was seated beside the Master. Sri Ramakrishna could not control himself. He cried
out, "Ah!" and shed tears of love. He said to Baburam and M.: "Don't make a fuss if I fall
into an ecstatic mood or go into samādhi. Then the worldly people will take me for a
cheat."

Another scene: Nimai is invested with the sacred thread of the brahmins. He puts on the
traditional ochre robe of the sannyasi. Mother Sachi and the women of the
neighbourhood stand about while he begs for alms, singing:
Drop a morsel of food, I pray, into my begging bowl;
Alone I roam, a new-made yogi, on the highways of the world.
People of Braja, you I love, and so, time and again,
I come to you; at hunger's call I beg my food from door to
door.

The sun is low, and I must seek my home on the Jamuna's bank;
Into its waters fall my tears, as onward murmuring it flows.
The onlookers leave the stage. Nimai stands alone. The gods, in the guise of brahmin
men and women, sing his praises.
Thy body gleams like liquid moonlight;
Thou hast put on man's dwarfish form.
O Lord, Thee we salute!

Men:
Women: Bewitcher of the gopis' hearts,
Thou roamest in the shady groves
About Vrindāvan's vale.

Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha! 

The youths of Braja are Thy friends;
Thou curbest haughty Madan's pride.
Women: Thy love has made the gopis mad;
In ecstasy the Jamuna thrills.
Men: Narayana, Deluder of demons!
Refuge of the fear-stricken gods!
Women: O Lover of Braja, Thou dost beg
The love of Braja's comely maidens!
Nimai: Hail Sri Radha! Glory to Radha!
Listening to the music, the Master went into samādhi. The curtain fell and the orchestra
played on.
