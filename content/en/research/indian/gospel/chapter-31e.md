"You cannot achieve anything by moving at such a slow pace. You need stern renunciation. Can you achieve anything by counting fifteen months as a year? You seem to have no strength, no grit. You are as mushy as flattened rice soaked in milk. Be up and doing! Gird your loins!

"I don't like that song:

Brother, joyfully cling to God;

Thus striving, some day you may attain Him.
I don't care for the line, 'Thus striving, some day you may attain Him.' You need stern
renunciation. I say the same thing to Hazra.

"You ask me why you don't feel stern renunciation. There is a reason for it. You have
desires and tendencies within you. The same is true of Hazra. In our part of the country I have seen peasants bringing water into their paddy-fields. 

The fields have low ridges on all sides to prevent the water from leaking out; but these are made of mud and often have holes here and there. The peasants work themselves to death to bring the water,
which, however, leaks out through the holes. Desires are the holes. You practise japa
and austerities, no doubt, but they all leak out through the holes of your desires.

"They catch fish with a bamboo trap. The bamboo is naturally straight. But why is it bent in the trap? In order to catch the fish. Desires are the fish. Therefore the mind is bent down toward the world. If there are no desires, the mind naturally looks up toward God. 

"Do you know what it is like? It is like the needles of a balance. On account of the weight
of 'woman and gold' the two needles are not in line. It is 'woman and gold' that makes a
man stray from the path of yoga. Haven't you noticed the flame of a candle? The
slightest wind makes it waver. The state of yoga is like the candle-flame in a windless
place.

"The mind is dispersed. Part of it has gone to Dāccā, part to Delhi, and another part to Coochbehar. That mind is to be gathered in; it must be concentrated on one object. If you want sixteen ānnā’s worth of cloth, then you have to pay the merchant the full sixteen ānnās.

Yoga is not possible if there is the slightest obstacle. If there is a tiny
break in the telegraph-wire, then the news cannot be transmitted.

"You are no doubt in the world. What if you are? You must urrender the fruit of your
action to God. You must not seek any result for yourself. But mark one thing. The desire
for bhakti cannot be called a desire. You may desire bhakti and pray for it. Practise the
tamas of bhakti and force your demand upon the Divine Mother.

This bitterly contested suit between the Mother and Her son-
What sport it is! says Ramprasad. I shall not cease tormenting Thee 

Till Thou Thyself shalt yield the fight and take me in Thine
arms at last.

"Trailokya once remarked, 'As I was born into the family, I have a share in the estate.'
"God is your own Mother. Is She a stepmother? Is it an artificial relationship? If you
cannot force your demand on Her, then on whom can you force it? Say to Her:
Mother, am I Thine eight-months child? Thy red eyes cannot
frighten me!.

A deed of gift I hold in my heart, attested by Thy Husband Śiva;
I shall sue Thee, if I must, and with a single point shall win.
"God is your own Mother. Enforce your demand. If you are part of a thing, you feel its
attraction. Because of the element of the Divine Mother in me I feel attracted to Her. A
true Saiva has some of the characteristics of Śiva; he has in him some of the elements
of Śiva. He who is a true Vaishnava is endowed with some of the elements of Narayana.
"Nowadays you don't have to attend to worldly duties. Spend a few days thinking of God.
You have seen that there is nothing to the world."

The Master sang:

Remember this, O mind! Nobody is your own:
Vain is your wandering in this world.
Trapped in the subtle snare of māyā as you are,
Do not forget the Mother's name.
Only a day or two men honour you on earth
As lord and master; all too soon
That form, so honoured now, must needs be cast away,
When Death, the Master, seizes you.
670Even your beloved wife, for whom, while yet you live,
You fret yourself almost to death,
Will not go with you then; she too will say farewell,
And shun your corpse as an evil thing.

Continuing, the Master said: "What are these things you busy yourself with-this
arbitration and leadership? I hear that you settle people's quarrels and that they make
you the arbiter. You have been doing this kind of work a long time. Let those who care
for such things do them. Now devote your mind more and more to the Lotus Feet of
God. The saying goes: 'Ravana died in Lanka and Behula wept bitterly for him!'

"Sambhu, too, said, 'I shall build hospitals and dispensaries.' He was a devotee of God;
so I said to him, 'Will you ask God for hospitals and dispensaries when you see Him?'

"Keshab Sen asked me, 'Why do I not see God?' I said, 'You do not see God because you
busy yourself with such things as name and fame and scholarship.' The mother does not
come to the child as long as it sucks its toy-a red toy. But when, after a few minutes, it
throws the toy away and cries, then the mother takes down the rice-pot from the hearth
and comes running to the child.

"You are engaged in arbitration. The Divine Mother says to Herself:'My child over there is
now busy arbitrating and is very happy. Let him be.' "
In the mean time Ishan had been holding Sri Ramakrishna's feet. He said humbly, "It is
not my will that I should do those things."

MASTER: "I know it. This is the Divine Mother's play-Her lila. It is the will of the Great Enchantress that many should remain entangled in the world. Do you know what it is like?

How many are the boats, O mind, That float on the ocean of this world!
How many are those that sink!

Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free;
And Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, O 
Mother, watching them!

Only one or two in a hundred thousand get liberation. The rest are entangled through the will of the Divine Mother.
"Haven't you seen the game of hide-and-seek? It is the 'granny's' will that the game should continue. If all touch her and are released, then the playing comes to a stop.

Therefore it is not her will that all should touch her.

You see, in big grain stores the merchants keep rice in great heaps that touch the ceiling. Beside them there are heaps of lentils. 

To protect the grain from the mice, the merchants leave trays of puffed rice and sweetened rice near it. The mice like the smell and the sweet taste of these and so stayaround the trays. They don't find the big heaps
of grain. Similarly, men are deluded by 'woman and gold'; they do not know where God
is.”

"Rāma said to Nārada, 'Ask a boon of Me.' 

Nārada said: 'O Rāma, is there anything I lack? What shall I ask of Thee? But if Thou must give me a boon, grant that I may have selfless love for Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not be deluded by Thy world-bewitching māyā.' Rāma said, 'Nārada, ask something else.' Nārada again replied: O Rāma, I don't want anything else Be gracious to me and see that I have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet.'” 

"I prayed to the Divine Mother: 'O Mother, I don't want name and fame I don't want the eight occult powers. I don't want a hundred occult powers O Mother, I have no desire for creature comforts. Please, Mother, grant me the boon that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet.'”

The Adhyātma Rāmāyana writes that Lakshmana asked Rāma 'Rāma, in how many forms and moods do You exist? How shall I be able to recognize You?' Rāma said:

'Brother, remember this. You may be certain that I exist wherever you find the
manifestation of ecstatic love.' That love makes one laugh and weep and dance and sing;
if anyone has developed such love, you may know for certain that God Himself is
manifest there. Chaitanyadeva reached that state."
