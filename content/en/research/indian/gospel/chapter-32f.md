It was 10pm. The Master got into a carriage to return to Dakshineswar. One or two attending devotees got in with him. The carriage stood under a tree, in deep darkness. Beni Pāl wanted to send some sweets and other food with Sri
Ramakrishna for Ramlal, the Master's nephew.

BENI PĀL: "Sir, Ramlal was not here this evening. With your permission I should like to
send some sweets for him by your attendants."

MASTER (with great anxiety): "Oh, Beni Pāl! Oh, sir! Please don't send these things with
me. That will do me harm. It is never possible for me to lay up anything. I hope you
won't mind."

BENI PĀL: "As you please, sir. Please give me your blessing."

MASTER: "Oh, we have been very happy today! You see, he alone is a true man who has
made money his servant. But those who do not know the use of money are not men
even though they have human forms. They may have human bodies, but they behave
like animals. You are blessed indeed. You have made so many devotees happy today."


Monday, October 20, 1884

Two days after the worship of Kāli, the Mārwāris of the Burrabazar section of Calcutta
were celebrating the Annakuta festival. Sri Ramakrishna had been invited by the Mārwāri
devotees to the ceremony at 12 Mallick Street. It was the second day of the bright
fortnight of the moon. The festival connected with the worship of Kāli, known as the
"Festival of Light", was still going on at Burra bazar.

About 3pm, M. and the younger Gopal came to Burrabazar. M. had in his hand a bundle of cloths he had purchased for Sri Ramakrishna. Mallick Street was jammed with people, bullock-carts, and carriages. As M. and Gopal approached
Mallick Street they noticed Sri Ramakrishna in a carriage, which could hardly move because of the jam. Baburam and Ram Chakravarty were with the Master. He smiled at M. and Gopal.

Sri Ramakrishna alighted from the carriage. With Baburam he proceeded on foot to the
house of his host, M. leading the way. They saw the courtyard of the house filled with big
bales of clothes which were being loaded into bullock-carts for shipment. The Mārwāri
host greeted the Master and led him to the third floor of the house. A painting of Kāli
hung on the wall. Sri Ramakrishna bowed before it. He sat down and became engaged in
conversation with the devotees. One of the Mārwāris began to stroke his feet. The
Master asked him to stop. After reflecting a minute he said, "All right, you can stroke
them a little." His words were full of compassion.

MASTER (to M.): "What about your school?"

M: "Today is a holiday, sir."

MASTER (smiling): "Tomorrow there will be a musical recital of the Chandi at Adhar's house."

Master and the Mārwāri pundit

The host sent a pundit to Sri Ramakrishna. He saluted the Master and took a seat. Soon
they were engaged in conversation. They talked about spiritual things.

MASTER: "God incarnates Himself for the bhakta and not for the Jnāni."

PUNDIT: "'I incarnate Myself in every age for the protection of the good, for the
destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of dharma.' God becomes man,
first, for the joy of the bhakta, and secondly, for the destruction of the wicked. The
Jnāni has no desire."

MASTER (smiling): "But I have not got rid of all desires. I have the desire for love of
God." The pundit's son entered the room. He saluted the Master and took a seat.

MASTER (to the pundit): "Well, what is bhava and what is bhakti?"

PUNDIT: "Meditation on God mellows the mind. This mellowness is called
like the thawing of ice when the sun rises."

<!-- bhava. It is -->

MASTER: "Well, what is prema?"

The pundit and Sri Ramakrishna were talking in Hindusthani. The former gave some sort
of explanation of prema.

MASTER (to the pundit): "No! No! That is not the meaning. Prema means such love for
God that it makes a man forget the world and also his body, which is so dear to him.
Chaitanyadeva had prema."

PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. One behaves like a drunkard."

MASTER: "Some people develop bhakti and others do not; how do you explain that, sir?"
PUNDIT: "There is no partiality in God. He is the Wish-fulfilling Tree. Whatever a man
asks of God he gets. But he must go near the Tree to ask the boon."
The pundit said all this in Hindusthani. The Master explained it to M.in Bengali.


## Different kinds of samādhi

MASTER: "Sir, please describe samādhi to us."

PUNDIT: "There are two kinds of samādhi: savikalpa
nirvikalpa samādhi the functioning of the mind stops altogether."

<!-- and
nirvikalpa.
In -->


MASTER: "Yes. The mind completely takes the form of Reality. The distinction between
the meditator and the object of meditation does not exist. There are two other kinds of
samādhi: chetana and jada. Nārada and Sukadeva attained chetana samādhi. Isn't that
true, sir?"

PUNDIT: "Yes, sir, that is so."

MASTER: "Further, there are the unmana samādhi and the sthita samādhi. Isn't that
true, sir?"

The pundit remained silent. He did not venture an opinion.

MASTER: "Well, sir, through the practice of japa and austerity one can get occult powers,
such as walking on the water of the Ganges. Isn't that true?"

PUNDIT: "Yes, one can. But a devotee doesn't want them." The conversation continued
for some time. The pundit said he would visit the Master at Dakshineswar the next
ekadasi day.

MASTER: "Ah! Your boy is very nice."

PUNDIT: "Well, revered sir, all this is transitory. It is like the waves in a river-one goes
down and another comes up."

MASTER: "You have substance in you."

After a few minutes the pundit saluted Sri Ramakrishna. He said: "I shall have to
perform my daily devotions. Please let me go."

MASTER: "Oh, sit down! Sit down!"

The pundit sat down again. The conversation turned to hathayoga. The pundit discussed
the subject with the Master in Hindusthani. Sri Ramakrishna said: "Yes, that is also a form of austerity. But the hathayogi identifies himself with his body. His mind dwells on his body alone." The pundit took leave of the Master. Sri Ramakrishna conversed with the pundit's son.

MASTER: "One can understand the Bhagavata well if one has already studied the Nyaya,
the Vedānta , and the other systems of philosophy. Isn't that so?"

PUNDIT'S SON: "Yes, sir. It is very necessary to study the Samkhya philosophy."

The conversation went on. Sri Ramakrishna was leaning against a big pillow; the devotees were sitting on the floor. Lying in that position, the Master began to sing: Brother, joyfully cling to God;
Thus striving, some day you may attain Him.

Their host entered the room and saluted Sri Ramakrishna. He was a pious man and
devoted to the Master. The pundit's son was still there. The Master asked if the Panini,
the Sanskrit grammar, was taught in the schools. He further asked about the Nyaya and
the Vedānta philosophies. The host did not show much interest in the discussion and
changed the subject.

HOST: "Revered sir, what is the way for us?"

MASTER: "Chanting the name and glories of God, living in the company of holy men, and earnestly praying to God."

HOST: "Please bless me, sir, that I may pay less and less attention to worldly things."

MASTER (smiling): "How much attention do you give to the world? Fifty per cent?"

(Laughter.)

HOST: "You know that, sir. We cannot achieve anything without the grace of a holy person like yourself."

MASTER: "If you please God, everyone will be pleased. It is God alone that exists in the
heart of the holy man."

HOST: "Nothing, of course, remains unrealized when one attains God. If a man attains God, he can give up everything else. If a man gets a rupee, he gives up the joy of a penny."

MASTER: "A little spiritual discipline is necessary. Through the practice of discipline one
gradually obtains divine joy. Suppose a jar with money inside is hidden deep under the
earth and someone wants to possess it. In that case he must take the trouble of digging
for it.

As he digs, he perspires. After much digging the spade strikes the metal jar. He
feels a thrill at the sound. The more sound the spade makes, striking against the jar, the
more joy he feels. "Pray to Rāma. Meditate on Him. He will certainly provide you with
everything."

HOST: "Revered sir, you are Rāma Himself."

MASTER: "How is that? The waves belong to the river; does the river belong to the
waves?"

HOST: "Rāma dwells only in the hearts of holy men. He cannot be seen in any other
way. There is no Incarnation of God at the present time."

MASTER (smiling): "How do you know there is no Divine Incarnation?"

The host remained silent.

MASTER: "All cannot recognize an Incarnation. When Nārada visited Rāma, Rāma
prostrated Himself before Nārada and said: 'We are worldly creatures. How can we be
sanctified unless holy men like you visit us?' Further, Rāma went into exile in the forest
to redeem His father's pledges. He saw that, since hearing of His exile, the rishis of the
forest had been fasting. Many of them did not know that Rāma was none other than the
Supreme Brahman."

HOST: "You too are that same Rāma."

MASTER: "For heaven's sake! Never say that."
