Friday, April 24, 1885


Around 1PM, M. arrived at Balarām's house in Calcutta and found the Master asleep, one or two devotees resting near him. M began to fan the Master gently. A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna woke up and sat on the bed with his clothes in a rather untidy condition. M saluted him and took the dust of his feet.

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
(tenderly to M.): "Are you well? I'm feeling rather uneasy. I have a sore throat. I suffer very much during the early hours of the morning. Can you tell me how I
may be cured? (In a worried tone) They served pickled mango with the meal. I ate a little of it.

"How is your wife? I noticed the other day that she was looking rather sickly. Give her soothing drinks to keep her nerves cool."

M: "Green coconut milk, sir?"


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Yes. A drink made of sugar candy is also good."
{{< /l >}}


M: "Since last Sunday I have been living at our house with my parents."

MASTER: "You have done well. It will be convenient for you to live at home. Since your parents live there, you won't have to worry so much about the family."
While Sri Ramakrishna was talking, his mouth became dry. He said to M., like a child: "I feel a dryness in my mouth. Do you all feel that way?"
M. (to Jogin): "Is your mouth also drying up?" 

JOGIN: "No. Perhaps it is due to the heat."

Jogindra of Ariadaha was an intimate disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, and later, after the
passing away of the Master, renounced the world. Sri Ramakrishna's clothes were still
untidy. Some of the devotees smiled.

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
I look like a mother nursing her babies. (All laugh.) Well, my tongue is drying up. Shall I eat a pear or a jamrul?
{{< /l >}}


BABURAM: "Let me get a jamrul for you."

MASTER: "You don't have to go out in this sun."


M was still fanning the Master.

MASTER: "You may stop now. You have been fanning a long time."

M: "I am not tired, sir."

MASTER (tenderly): "No?"

M taught in a school in the neighbourhood. He had a little recess at one o'clock, during
which he visited Sri Ramakrishna. It was time for him to go back to the school. He
saluted the Master.

MASTER (to M.): "Must you go now?"

A DEVOTEE: "School is not over yet. He came here during recess."

MASTER (smiling): "He is like a mother with seven or eight children. Day and night she
is busy with her worldly duties. But now and then she makes time to serve her
husband."

M.'s school closed at four o'clock. He came back to Balarām's house and found the Master sitting in the drawing room. The devotees were arriving one by one. The younger
Naren and Ram came. Narendra, too, was there. M saluted the Master and took a seat,
The ladies sent a plate of halua for Sri Ramakrishna. Because of the sore in his throat he
could not eat any hard food.

MASTER (to Narendra): "Ah! This is nice stuff! Eat some! It is good! Eat some!" (All laugh.)

Dusk was coming on. Sri Ramakrishna was about to go to the house of Girish, who had
arranged a festival to celebrate the Master's coming. The Master came down from the
second floor of Balarām's house with M. and a few other devotees. Near the gate he saw
a beggar chanting the name of Rāma, and he stood still. He fell into a meditative mood
and remained standing a few minutes. He said to M., "He sings well" A devotee gave the
beggar four pice.

Sri Ramakrishna entered Bosepara Lane. Laughing, he said to M.: "What are these people saying? 'There comes Paramahamsa's battalion!' What these fools say!" (All laugh.)
Sri Ramakrishna entered Girish's house. The latter had invited a large number of devotees to join the festival. Many of them were present. They all stood up to receive
the Master, who, smiling, took his seat. The devotees sat around him. Among them were
Girish, Mahimacharan, Ram, and Bhavanāth, and also Baburam, Narendra, Jogin, the
younger Naren, Chuni, Balarām, M., and the other devotees who had accompanied the
Master from Balarām's house.

MASTER (to Mahimacharan): "I said to Girish about you, 'There is one-very deep. You are only knee-deep.' Now you must help me check up on what I said. I want to see you
two argue. But don't compromise." (All laugh.) 

Girish and Mahimacharan started their discussion. Soon Ram said: "Let them stop. Let us
have some kirtan."

MASTER (to Ram): "No, no! This has a great deal of meaning. They are 'Englishmen'. I
want to hear what they say."

Discussion about Divine Incarnation

Mahimacharan contended that all could become Krishna by means of sādhanā . Girish
said that Sri Krishna was an Incarnation of God. However much a man practised
sādhanā , he could never be an Incarnation.

MAHIMA: "Do you know what I mean? Let me give an illustration. The bel-tree can
become a mango-tree if only the obstructions are removed. It can be done by the
practice of yoga."

GIRISH: "You may say whatever you like, but it cannot be done either by the practice of
yoga or by anything else. Only a Krishna can become Krishna. If anybody has all the
attributes of another person, Radha for instance, then he is none other than that person-
Radha herself. If I see in a person all the attributes of Krishna, then I shall conclude that
I am seeing Krishna Himself."

Mahimacharan could not argue well. At last he had to accept Girish's views.

MAHIMA (to Girish): "Yes, sir, both views are right. God has willed the path of
knowledge. He has also willed the path of bhakti. (Pointing to Sri Ramakrishna) As he
says, by different paths people ultimately reach one and the same goal."

MASTER (aside to Mahima): "You see, what I said was right, wasn't it?"

MAHIMA: "Yes, sir. As you say, both paths are right."

MASTER (pointing to Girish): "Haven't you noticed how deep his faith is? He forgot to eat his refreshments. Like a dog, he would have tom your throat if you hadn't accepted his view. But we have enjoyed the discussion. You two have known each other and I myself have learnt many things."

The musician arrived with his party and sat in the middle of the room. He was waiting for a sign from Sri Ramakrishna to begin the kirtan. The master gave his permission.
RAM (to the Master): "Please tell them what to sing."

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
What shall I suggest? (After a little reflection) Well, let them sing the prelude
to the union of Radha and Krishna."

The musician sang:
My Gora, my treasure, the jewel among men,
Weeps as he chants Sri Radha's name
And rolls on the ground; with fervent love
He chants her name again and again.
The tears stream from his love-filled eyes;
Once more he rolls upon the ground,
As chanting her name he faints away.
The hair on his body stands on end;
His tongue can lisp but a single word.
Says Basu: Why is Gora so restless?
