Saturday, June 13, 1885

About 3pm, Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room after the midday meal. 

A pundit was sitting on a mat on the floor. Near the north door of the room stood a brahmin woman who had recently lost her only daughter and was stricken with grief. 

Kishori, too, was in the room. M. arrived and saluted the Master. He was
accompanied by Dwija and a few other devotees.

Sri Ramakrishna was not well. He had been suffering from an inflamed throat. These were the hot days of summer. M. was not keeping well either, and of late he had not been able to visit Sri Ramakrishna frequently.

MASTER (to M.): "How are you? It is nice to see you. The bel-fruit you sent me was very good."

M: "I am slightly better now, sir."

MASTER: "It is very hot. Take a little ice now and then. I have been feeling the heat very much myself; so I ate a great deal of ice-cream. That is why I have this sore throat. The saliva smells very bad.


## Master's adherence to truth

"I have said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, make me well. I shall not eat ice-cream any more.' Next I said to Her that I wouldn't eat ice either. Since I have given my word to the Mother, I shall certainly not eat these things. But sometimes I become forgetful. 

Once I said that I wouldn't eat fish on Sundays; but one Sunday I forgot and ate fish.

But I cannot consciously go back on my word. The other day I asked a devotee to bring my water-jug to the pine-grove. As he had to go elsewhere, another man brought the jug. But I couldn't use that water. I was helpless. I waited there until the first man brought water for me.

"When I renounced everything with an offering of flowers at the Lotus Feet of the Mother, I said: 'Here, Mother, take Thy holiness, take Thy unholiness. Here, Mother, take Thy dharma, take Thy adharma. Here, Mother, take Thy sin, take Thy virtue. 

Here,  Mother, take Thy good, take Thy evil. And give me only pure bhakti.' But I could not say, 'Here, Mother, take Thy truth, take Thy falsehood.' "

A devotee had brought some ice. Again and again the Master asked M., "Shall I eat it?"

M: said humbly, "Please don't eat it without consulting the Mother:" Sri Ramakrishna
could not take the ice.

MASTER: "It is the bhakta, and not the Jnāni, who discriminates between holiness and unholiness. Vijay's mother-in-law said to me: 'How little I have achieved of my spiritual ideal! I cannot take food from everybody.' I said to her: 'Is eating everybody's food a sign of jnāna? 

A dog eats anything and everything. Does that make it a Jnāni?'

(To M.) "Why do I eat a variety of dishes? In order not to become monotonous.

Otherwise I should have to renounce the devotees.

"I said to Keshab: 'If I instruct you from a still higher standpoint, then you won't be able
to preserve your organization. In the state of jnāna organizations and things like that
become unreal, like a dream.'

"One time I gave up fish. At first I suffered from it; afterwards it didn't bother me much.

If someone burns up a bird's nest, the bird flies about; it takes shelter in the sky. If a
man truly realizes that the body and the world are unreal, then his soul attains samādhi.

"Formerly I had the state of mind of a Jnāni: I couldn't enjoy the company of men. I
would hear that a Jnāni or a bhakta lived at a certain place; then, a few days later, I
would learn that he was dead. Everything seemed to me impermanent; so I couldn't
enjoy people's company. Later the Mother brought my mind down to a lower plane; She
so changed my mind that I could enjoy love of God and His devotees."

## Divine Incarnation

Next the Master began to talk about Divine Incarnation.

MASTER (to M.): "Do you know why God incarnates Himself as a man? It is because
through a human body one can hear His words. He sports through it. He tastes divine
bliss through a human body. But through His other devotees God manifests only a small
part of Himself. A devotee is like something you get a little juice from after much sucking
- like a flower you get a drop of honey from after much sucking. (To M.) Do you understand this?"

M: "Yes, sir. Very well"

Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to Dwija, who was about sixteen years old. His father had
married a second time. Dwija often accompanied M. to Dakshineswar, and Sri

Ramakrishna was fond of him. The boy said that his father opposed his coming to
Dakshineswar.

MASTER: "And your brothers too? Do they speak slightingly of me?"

Dwija did not answer.

M. (to the Master): "Those who speak slightingly of you will be cured of it after getting a
few more blows from the world."

MASTER (referring to Dwija's brothers): "They live with their step-mother. So they are
getting blows."

All were silent a moment.

MASTER (to M.): "Introduce Dwija to Purna some time."

M: "Yes, I shall. (To Dwija) Go to Panihati."

MASTER: "I am asking everyone to send people to Panihati. (To M.) Won't you go?"

Sri Ramakrishna intended to visit the religious festival at Panihati; so he was asking the
devotees to go too.

M: "Yes, sir, I want to go."

MASTER: "We shall engage a big boat; then it won't toss about. Will Girish Ghosh be there?"

Sri Ramakrishna looked steadily at Dwija.

Master: "Well, there are so many youngsters in the city; why does this boy come here?

(To M,) Tell me what you think. Certainly he has inherited some good tendencies from his previous birth."

M: "Undoubtedly, sir."

MASTER: "There is such a thing as inborn tendencies. When a man has performed many good actions in his previous births, in the final birth he becomes guileless. In the final birth he acts somewhat like a madcap.

"To tell you the truth, everything happens by God's will. When He says 'Yea', everything comes to pass, and when He says 'Nay', everything comes to a standstill.

"Why is it that one man should not bless another? Because nothing can happen by man's will: things come to pass or disappear by God's will. 

'The other day I went to Captain's house. I saw some young boys going along the road.

They belong to a different class. I saw one of them, about nineteen or twenty years old,
with his hair parted on the side. He was whistling as he walked along.

"I see some immersed in the thickest tamas. They play the flute and are proud of it.

(To Dwija) "Why should a man of Knowledge be afraid of criticism? His understanding is as immovable as the anvil in a blacksmith's shop. Blows from the hammer fall continually on the anvil but cannot affect it in the least.
"I saw X-'s father going along the street."

M: "He is a very artless man."

MASTER: "But he has red eyes."

Sri Ramakrishna told the devotees about his visit to Captain's house. Captain had criticized the young men who visited the Master. Perhaps Hazra had poisoned his mind.

MASTER: "I was talking to Captain. I said: 'Nothing exists except Purusha and Prakriti.

Nārada said to Rāma, "O Rāma, all the men You see are parts of Yourself, and all the
women are parts of Sita." '

Captain was highly pleased. He said: 'You alone have the right perception. All men are
really Rāma, being parts of Rāma; all women are really Sita, being parts of Sita.'
