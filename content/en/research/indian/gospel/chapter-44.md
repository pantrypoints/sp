August 9, 1885

SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar. Rakhal, M., Dwija and his father, and other devotees were present. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.

After returning from Vrindāvan Rakhal had spent a few days at home. Now he was staying with the Master. Lātu, Harish, and Ramlal were also staying at the temple
garden.


## Beginning of Master's illness

Sri Ramakrishna was not well. It was the beginning of the illness subsequently diagnosed as the fatal cancer. But this did not disturb the serenity of his mind. Day and night he had only one thought, and that was the spiritual welfare of his disciples. He was guiding them toward the attainment of God. He encouraged them constantly to cultivate
knowledge and devotion and warned them of the snares of "woman and gold". He was completely indifferent to his own illness and devoted himself whole-heartedly to the
fulfilment of his earthly mission.

Dwija was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, his father married a second time. Dwija often accompanied M. to Dakshineswar; but his father did not
approve of it.

Dwija's father had for a long time been speaking of visiting Sri Ramakrishna. Today he had come to Dakshineswar. He was the manager of a business firm in Calcutta and had
passed his examination in law.


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
MASTER (to Dwija's father): "Please don't mind your children's coming here.
{{< /l >}}


I ask people to live in the world after the awakening of their spiritual consciousness.

After extracting gold through hard labour, a man may keep it under earth or in a box or under water. The gold is not affected.

"I ask people to live in the world in a spirit of detachment. If you break the jack-fruit after rubbing oil on your hands, its sticky juice will not smear them.

"If the 'unripe' mind dwells in the world, the mind gets soiled. One should first attain knowledge and then live in the world.

"If you put milk in water the milk is spoiled. But this will not happen if butter, churned from the milk, is put in water."


DWIJA'S FATHER: "That is true, sir."Instructing Dwija's father

MASTER (smiling): "I know why you scold your children. You only threaten them. The brahmachari said to the snake; 'you are a fool indeed! I forbade you to bite but not to
hiss. 

Your enemies would not have beaten you, if only you had hissed at them.' Your scolding of the children is really a hissing. (Dwija's father smiles.)

"A good son is a indication of his father's spiritual nature. If good water comes out when a reservoir is dug, it only indicates the virtue of the owner.

"A son is called Atmaja, 'the self reborn'. There is no difference between you and your son. In one way you yourself are reborn as your son. In one sense you are a worldly person, working in a business office and enjoying worldly life; in another sense you are a devotee of God, in the form of your son. I heard that you were a very worldly person;
but now I find it isn't so.

(Smiling) You know all this. I understand that you are very
circumspect. Perhaps that is why you are nodding your assent to what I am saying.
(Dwija's father smiles.)

"If your children visit this place, they will be able to know what you really are. How
precious one's father is! If a person deceives his father and mother in order to seek
religion, he gets only worthless trash.

## Man's several debts

"A man is born with several debts: debts to his father, the devas, and the rishis.

Besides, there is his debt to his mother. He also has a debt to his wife; She must be supported. If the wife is chaste, the husband must provide for her after his death. 

"I could not live at Vrindāvan on account of my mother. When I remembered that my
mother was living in the temple garden here at Dakshineswar, I could not feel peaceful
at Vrindāvan.

"I ask people to live in the world and at the same time fix their minds on God. I don't
ask them to give up the world. I say, 'Fulfil your worldly duties and also think of God.' "

DWIJA'S FATHER; "I tell my children that they should attend to their studies. I don't
forbid them to come to you, but I don't want them to waste time in frivolities with the
youngsters."

MASTER (referring to Dwija): "This boy must have been born with some good tendencies. Why are the two other brothers different from him? Why is he alone spiritually minded?

Will you be able to compel him not to visit this place? Sooner or later everyone unfolds his inborn tendencies."

DWIJA'S FATHER: "Yes, that is true."

Sri Ramakrishna came down from the couch and sat on the floor beside Dwija's father.
While talking with him he touched him now and then.It was nearly evening. Sri Ramakrishna asked M. and the others to show Dwija's father the temples. He said to them, "I should have accompanied him myself if I were well." He
asked someone to give sweets to the young men and said to Dwija's father: "Let the
children have a little refreshment. It is customary." Dwija's father visited the temples
and the images and took a stroll in the garden.

Sri Ramakrishna engaged happily in conversation with Bhupen, Dwija, M., and others on
the southeast porch of his room. He playfully slapped Bhupen and M. on the back. He
said to Dwija with a laugh, "How I talked to your father!"
Dwija's father returned to Sri Ramakrishna's room after dusk. He intended to leave
shortly. He was feeling hot. Sri Ramakrishna fanned him himself. In a few minutes the
father took leave of the Master. Sri Ramakrishna stood up to bid him farewell.
It was eight o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Mahimacharan. Rakhal, M., and one
or two companions of Mahimacharan were in the room. Mahimacharan was going to
spend the night at the temple garden.

## Mahima's estimate of the devotees

MASTER (to Mahima): "Well, how do you find Kedār? Has he only seen milk, or has he drunk it too?"

MAHIMA "Yes, he is enjoying bliss."

MASTER: "Nityagopal?"

MAHIMA "Very good. He is in a lofty state of mind."

MASTER: "Yes. Well, what about Girish Ghosh?"

MAHIMA "He too has developed nicely, but he belongs to another class."

MASTER: "And Narendra?"

MAHIMA "He is now in the state I was in fifteen years ago."

MASTER: "The younger Naren? How guileless he is!"

MAHIMA "Yes, quite guileless."

MASTER: "You are right. (Reflecting a little) Let me see who else. It will be sufficient for the youngsters who come here if they know only two things. If they know these, they will not have to practise much discipline and austerity. First, who I am, and second, who they are. Many of the youngsters belong to the inner circle.

"Those belonging to the inner circle will not attain liberation. I shall have to assume a human body again, in a northwesterly direction."I feel peace of mind when I see the youngsters. How can I feel joy at the sightof those
who have begotten children and are engaged in lawsuits and are involved in 'woman and
gold'? How could I live without seeing pure souled persons?"

Mahimacharan recited some texts from the scriptures. He also described various mystic rites of the Tantra.

MASTER: "Well, some say that my soul, going into samādhi, lies about like a bird in the

Mahakasa, the Infinite Space.
