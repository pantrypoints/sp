"Therefore I feel that it is the Divine Mother Herself who dwells in this body and plays with the devotees. When I first had my exalted state of mind, my body would radiate light. My chest was always flushed. Then I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, do not reveal Thyself outwardly. Please go inside.' That is why my complexion is so dull now. If my body were still luminous, people would have tormented me; a crowd would always have thronged here. Now there is no outer manifestation. That keeps weeds away. 

Only genuine devotees will remain with me now. Do you know why I have this illness? It has the same significance. Those whose devotion to me has a selfish motive behind it will run away at the sight of my illness.

"I cherished a desire. I said to the Mother, 'O Mother, I shall be the king of the
devotees.'

"Again, this thought arose in my mind: 'He who sincerely prays to God will certainly come here. He must.' You see, that is what is happening now. Only people of that kind come."My parents knew who dwells inside this body. Father had a dream at Gaya. 

In that dream Raghuvir said to him, 'I shall be born as your son.'

"God alone dwells inside this body. Such renunciation of 'woman and gold!' Could I have accomplished that myself? I have never enjoyed a woman, even in a dream.


## Totapuri

"Nangta instructed me in Vedānta. In three days I went into samādhi. At the sight of my
samādhi under the madhavi vine, he was quite taken aback and exclaimed, 'Ah! What is
this?' Then he came to know who resides in this body. He said to me, 'Please let me go.'

At these words of Totapuri, I went into an ecstatic mood and said, 'You cannot go till I
realize the Truth of Vedānta.'

"Day and night I lived with him. We talked only Vedānta. The Brahmani used to say to
me: 'Don't listen to Vedānta. It will injure your devotion to God.'


## Mathur Babu

"I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, please get me a rich man. If You don't, how shall I
be able to protect this body? How shall I be able to keep the sādhus and devotees near
me?' That is why Mathur Babu provided for my needs for fourteen years.

"He who dwells in me tells me beforehand what particular class of devotees will come to me. When I have a vision of Gaurānga, I know that devotees of Gaurānga are coming.

When I have a vision of Ran, the Saktas come.

"At the time of the evening service I used to cry out from the roof of the kuthi, weeping:
'Oh, where are you all? Come to me!' You see, they are all gathering here, one by one.
"God Himself dwells in this body. It is He who, of His own accord, is working with these
devotees.

"What a wonderful state of mind some of the devotees have! The younger Naren gets
kumbhaka without any effort, and samādhi too. Sometimes he stays in an ecstatic mood
for two and a half hours; sometimes even more. How wonderful!

"I have practised all kinds of sādhanā : Jnāna yoga, karma yoga, and bhakti yoga. I have
even gone through the exercises of hathayoga to increase longevity. There is another
Person dwelling in this body. Otherwise, after attaining samādhi, how could I live with
the devotees and enjoy the love of God? Koar Singh used to say to me: 'I have never
before seen a person who has returned from the plane of samādhi. You are none other
than Nanak.'

"I live in the midst of worldly people; on all sides I see 'woman and gold'. Nevertheless,
this is the state of my mind: unceasing samādhi and bhava. That is the reason Pratap
said, at the sight of my ecstatic mood: 'Good heavens! It is as if he were possessed by a
ghost!' "Rakhal, M., and the others were speechless as they drank in this account of Sri
Ramakrishna's unique experiences.

But did Mahimacharan understand the import of these words? Even after hearing them, he said to the Master, "These things have happened to you on account of your meritorious actions in your past births." Mahima still thought that Sri Ramakrishna was a
sādhu or a devotee of God. 

The Master nodded assent to Mahima's words and said: "Yes, the result of past actions. God is like an aristocrat who has many mansions. Here [referring to himself] is one of His drawing-rooms. The bhakta is God's drawing-room."

It was nine o'clock in the evening. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. It
was Mahimacharan's desire to form a brahmachakra in the presence of the Master.

Mahima formed a circle, on the floor, with Rakhal, M., Kishori, and one or two other
devotees. He asked them all to meditate. Rakhal went into an ecstatic state. The Master
came down from the couch and placed his hand on Rakhal's chest, repeating the name
of the divine Mother. Rakhal regained consciousness of the outer world.

It was 1am, the 14th day of the dark fortnight of the moon.

There was intense darkness everywhere. One or two devotees were pacing the concrete
embankment of the Ganges. Sri Ramakrishna was up. He came out and said to the
devotees, "Nangta told me that at this time, about midnight, one hears the Anāhata
sound."

In the early hours of the morning Mahimacharan and M. lay down on the floor of the
Master's room. Rakhal slept on a camp cot. Now and then Sri Ramakrishna paced up and
down the room with his clothes off, like a five-year-old child.
