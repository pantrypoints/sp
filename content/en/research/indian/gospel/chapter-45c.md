MASTER: "But it is not easy to get rid of illusion. It lingers even after the attainment of Knowledge. A man dreamt of a tiger. Then he woke up and his dream vanished. But his heart continued to palpitate.

"Some thieves came to a field. A straw figure resembling a man had been put there to
frighten intruders. The thieves were scared by the figure and could not persuade
themselves to enter the field. One of them, however, approached and found that it was
only a figure made of straw. He came back to his companions and said, 'There is nothing
to be afraid of.' But still they refused to go; they said that their hearts were beating fast.

Then the daring thief laid the figure on the ground and said, 'It is nothing, it is nothing.'

This is the process of 'Neti, neti'."

DOCTOR: "These are fine words."

MASTER (smiling): "What kind of words?"

DOCTOR: "Fine."

MASTER: "Then give me a 'Thank you'." [The Master said the words "thank you" in English.]DOCTOR: "Don't you know what is in my mind? I go to so much trouble to come and visit you!"

MASTER (smiling): "No, it is not that. Say something for the good of the ignorant. After
the death of Ravana , his brother Bibhishana refused to be king of Ceylon! He said: 'O
Rāma, I have obtained You. What shall I do with kingship?' Rāma said: 'Bibhishana, be
king for the sake of the ignorant, for those who might ask what riches you have gained by serving Me so much. Be king to give them a lesson."

DOCTOR: "Are there such ignorant people here?"

MASTER (smiling): "Oh, yes! Here you will find oysters and snails as well as conchs." (All
laugh.)

Doctor Sarkar, who was a homeopath, gave Sri Ramakrishna two globules of medicine.

He said, "I am giving you these two globules: one is Purusha and the other is Prakriti."
(All laugh,)

MASTER (smiling): "Oh yes, Purusha and Prakriti are always together. Haven't you
observed pigeons? The male and female cannot live separately. Wherever Purusha is,
there is Prakriti, and wherever Prakriti is, there is Purusha."

It was Vijaya day. Sri Ramakrishna asked Dr. Sarkar to have some refreshments. The
devotees served him with sweets.

DOCTOR (while eating): "Now I say 'Thank you' for the sweets; but it is not for your
teachings. Why should I give that 'Thank you' in words?"

MASTER (smiling): "The essential thing is to fix the mind on God and to practise
meditation a little. What more shall I say? (Pointing to the younger Naren) Look at him.
His mind totally merges in God. Those things I was telling you-"

DOCTOR: "Tell the others also."

MASTER: "No, a man should be given food according to his power of digestion. Can all
understand what I told you? I cannot talk to everyone as I talked to you. Suppose a
mother has bought a fish for the family. All her children have not the same power of
digestion. For some she makes pilau and for others she makes stew. These latter have
weak stomachs." (All laugh.)

Dr. Sarkar took his leave. It was Vijaya day, when people show their love and respect to
their friends and elders with appropriate greetings. The devotees all prostrated
themselves before Sri Ramakrishna and took the dust of his feet. Then they embraced
one another. Their joy knew no bounds. The Master was seriously ill, but he made them
all forget about his illness. The embracing and exchange of greetings continued a long
time. The devotees also took light refreshments. The younger Naren, M., and a few otherdevotees sat near Sri Ramakrishna. 

The Master talked to them joyfully. He spoke of Dr.Sarkar.

MASTER: "I shall not have to tell him very much. When the trunk of a tree is cut almost
to the other side, the cutter steps aside. A little later the tree falls down of itself."

THE YOUNGER NAREN (smiling): "Here everything is principle!"

MASTER (to M.): "The doctor has already changed a great deal, hasn't he?"

M: "Yes, sir. When he comes here he loses his wits. He never talks about medicine.

When we remind him of it, he says: 'Oh, yes, yes! I shall have to give the medicine.' "
Some of the devotees were singing in the parlour. They returned to the Master's room.
Sri Ramakrishna said: "I heard your music; but why did you make mistakes in the
rhythm? I once heard of a man who was an adept in discord. You sang like him." (All
laugh.)

A young man, a relative of the younger Naren, arrived. He was bespectacled and
foppishly dressed. Sri Ramakrishna spoke to the younger Naren.

MASTER: "You see, a young man was going along the road. He had put on a pleated
shirt. And how he strutted! Now and again he would display the shirt by removing his
scarf, and then look around to see if anyone was admiring him. But when he walked you
could see that he was knock-kneed. (All laugh.) The peacock displays its feathers; but its
feet are very dirty. 

(All laugh.)

The camel is very ugly. Everything about it is ugly."

YOUNG MAN: "But it acts well."

MASTER: "Yes. But it browses on briars. It will continue to eat thorns though its mouth
bleeds. The worldly man loses his children and still clamours for more."
