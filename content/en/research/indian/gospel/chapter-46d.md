October 24, 1885

It was around 1PM. 

Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the 2nd floor of the house at Syampukur. Dr. Sarkar, Narendra, Mahimacharan, M., and other devotees were in the room. 

Referring to homeopathy, the Master said to Dr. Sarkar, "This treatment of yours is very good."

DOCTOR: "According to homeopathy the physician has to check up the symptoms of the disease with the medical book. It is like Western music. The singer follows the score. 

"Where is Girish Ghosh? Never mind. Don't trouble him. He didn't sleep last night."

<!-- Dr. Sarkar explains samādhi -->

MASTER: "Well, when I am in samādhi I feel intoxicated as if I were drunk with siddhi.
What have you to say about that?"

DOCTOR (to M.): "In that state the nerve centres cease to function. Hence the limbs
become numb. Again, the legs totter because all the energy rushes toward the brain.

Life consists of the nervous system. There is a nerve centre in the nape of the neck
called the medulla oblongata. If that is injured, one may die."

Mahima Chakravarty began to describe the Kundalini. He said: "The Sushumna nerve
runs through the spinal cord in a subtle form. None can see it. That is what Śiva says."

DOCTOR: "Śiva examined man only in his maturity. But the Europeans have examined
man in all stages of his life from the embryo to maturity. It is good to know comparative
history. From the history of the Sonthals one learns that Kāli was a Santhāl woman. She
was a valiant fighter. (All laugh.)

"Don't laugh, please. Let me tell you how greatly the study of comparative anatomy has
benefited men. The difference between the actions of the pancreatic juice and bile was at
first unknown. But later Claude Bernard examined the stomach, liver, and other paits of
the rabbit and demonstrated that the action of bile is different from the action of the
pancreatic juice. Therefore It stands to reason that we should watch the lower animals
as well. The study of man alone is not enough.

"Similarly, the study of comparative religion is highly beneficial.
"Why do his [meaning the Master's] words go straight to our hearts? He has experienced
the truths of different religions. He himself has practised the disciplines of the Hindu,
Christian, Musslman, Sakta, and Vaishnava religions. The bees can make good honey
only if they gather nectar from different flowers."

M. (to Dr. Sarkar): "He (pointing to Mahimacharan) has studied science a great deal"

DOCTOR (smiling): "What science? Do you mean Max Muller's Science of Religion?"

MAHIMA (to the Master): "You are ill. But what can the doctor do about it? When I heard
of your illness, I thought that you were only going to pamper the doctor's pride."

MASTER (pointing to Dr. Sarkar): "But he is a very good physician. He is very learned
too."MAHIMA: "Yes, sir. He is a ship and we are only small boats."

Dr. Sarkar folded his hands in humility.

MAHIMIA: "But here in the Master's presence all are equal"

## Narendra's music

Sri Ramakrishna asked Narendra to sing. Narendra sang:
I have made Thee, O Lord, the Pole-star of my life;
No more shall I lose my way on the world's trackless sea. . . .

Then he sang:

Ever insane with pride am I, and many the cravings of my
heart! . . .
He sang again:
This universe, wondrous and infinite,
O Lord, is Thy handiwork;
And the whole world is a treasure house
Full of Thy beauty and grace.
Narendra continued:
O Father of the Universe, upon Thy lofty throne,
Thou dost enjoy the music of the worlds,
As Thy creation's praise they sweetly sing.
Behold, I too, though born of earth, have come with feeble
voice

Before the portal of Thy House.

I seek alone Thy vision, Lord! I crave no other boon.
Here I have come to sing my song for Thee;
From a far comer of the mighty throng
Where sun and moon are hymning Thee, I too would sing Thy
praise:

This is Thy lowly servant's prayer.
He sang another song:
O King of Kings, reveal Thyself to me!
I crave Thy mercy. Cast on me Thy glance!
At Thy dear feet I dedicate my life,
Seared in the fiery furnace of this world.
My heart, alas, is deeply stained with sin;
Ensnared in māyā, I am all but dead.
Compassionate Lord! Revive my fainting soul
With the life-giving nectar of Thy grace.
Again:Be drunk, O mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss!
Roll on the ground and weep, chanting Hari's sweet name! . . .

MASTER: "And sing that one- 'All that exists art Thou.'

DOCTOR: "Ah!"

Narendra sang:
I have joined my heart to Thee: all that exists art Thou;
Thee only have I found, for Thou art all that exists. .. . .
The singing was over. Dr. Sarkar sat there almost spellbound. After a time, with folded
hands, he said very humbly to Sri Ramakrishna: "Allow me to take my leave now. I shall
come again tomorrow."

MASTER: "Oh, stay a little. Girish Ghosh has been sent for. (Pointing to Mahima) He is a
scholar, yet he dances in the name of Hari. He has no pride. He went to Konnagar just
because we were there. He is wealthy; he is free; he serves nobody. (Pointing to
Narendra) What do you think of him?"

DOCTOR: "Excellent!"

MASTER (pointing to a devotee): "And him?"

DOCTOR: "Splendid!"

MAHlMA: "It can by no means be said that one knows philosophy unless one has read Hindu philosophy. The European philosophers do not know the twenty-four cosmic principles of the Samkhya philosophy. They cannot even grasp them."
