As the doctor listened to the words, he too became almost ecstatic. Sri Ramakrishna
again went into a deep spiritual mood and placed his foot on the doctor's lap. A few
minutes later he became conscious of the outer world and withdrew his foot. He said to
the doctor: "Ah, what a splendid thing you said the other day! 'We lie in the lap of God.

To whom shall we speak about our illness if not to Him?' If I must pray, I shall certainly
pray to Him." As Sri Ramakrishna said these words, his eyes filled with tears. Again he
went into ecstasy and said to the doctor, "You are very pure; otherwise I could not have
put my foot on your lap." Continuing, he said: "'He alone has peace who has tasted theBliss of Rāma.' What is this world? 

What is there in it? What is there in money, wealth,
honour, or creature comforts? 'O mind, know Rāma! Whom else should you know?' "
The devotees were worried to see the Master's repeated ecstasies in this state of ill
health. He said, "I shall be quiet if someone sings that song- 'The Wine of Heavenly
Bliss'."

Narendra was sent for from another room. He sang in his sweet voice:
Be drunk, O mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss!
Roll on the ground and weep, chanting Hari's sweet name!
Fill the arching heavens with your deep lion roar,
Singing Hari's sweet name! With both your arms upraised,
Dance in the name of Hari and give His name to all!
Swim day and night in the sea of the bliss of Hari's love;
Slay desire with His name, and blessed be your life!

MASTER: "And that one-'Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness'."

Narendra sang:
Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness waves of ecstatic love
arise:

Rapture divine! Play of God's Bliss!
Oh, how enthralling! . .
Narendra sang again:

Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord Hari,

The Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through.
How peerless is the light that in Him shines!
How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form!
How dear is He to all His devotees!

Ever more beauteous in fresh-blossoming love
That shames the splendour of a million moons,
Like lightning gleams the glory of His form,
Raising erect the hair for very joy.

Worship His feet in the lotus of your heart;
With mind serene and eyes made radiant
With heavenly love, behold that matchless sight.
Caught in the spell of His love's ecstasy,
Immerse yourself for evermore, O mind,

In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss.Dr. Sarkar listened to the songs attentively. When the singing was over, he said, 'That's
a nice one- 'Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness'."

At the sight of the doctor's joy, Sri Ramakrishna said: "The son said to the father,
'Father, you taste a little wine, and after that, if you ask me to give up drinking, I shall
do so.' After drinking the wine, the father said: 'Son, you may give it up. I have no
objection. But I am certainly not going to give it up myself!' (The doctor and the others
laugh.)

"The other day the Divine Mother showed me two men in a vision. He [meaning the
doctor] is one. She also revealed to me that he will have much knowledge; but it is dry
knowledge. (Smiling, to the doctor) But you will soften."

Dr. Sarkar remained silent.

Friday, November 6, 1885

It was the day of the Kāli Puja, the worship of the Divine Mother, Sri Ramakrishna's
Chosen Ideal. At about nine o'clock in the morning the Master, clad in a new cloth, stood
in the south room on the second floor of his temporary residence at Syampukur. He had
asked M. to offer worship to Siddhesvari at Thanthania, in the central part of Calcutta,
with flowers, green coconut, sugar, and other sweets. After bathing in the Ganges, M.
had offered the worship and come barefoot to Syampukur. He had brought the Prasad
with him. Sri Ramakrishna took off his shoes and with great reverence ate a little of the

Prasad and placed a little on his head.

At the Master's request M. had purchased two books of songs by Ramprasad and
Kamlakanta for Dr. Sarkar.

M: "Here are the books of songs by Ramprasad and Kamlakanta."
MASTER: "Force songs like these on the doctor:

How are you trying, O my mind, to know the nature of God?

Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
O mind, you do not know how to farm!
Fallow lies the field of your life.. .
Come, let us go for a walk, O mind, to Kāli, the Wish-fulfilling
Tree. . . ."

M: "Yes, sir."

Sri Ramakrishna was pacing the room with M. He had put on his slippers. In spite of his
painful illness his face beamed with joy.

MASTER: "And this song is also very good: 'This world is a framework of illusion.' "

M: "Yes, sir."Suddenly Sri Ramakrishna gave a start. He put aside his slippers and stood still. He was
in deep samādhi. It was the day of the Divine Mother's worship. Was that why he
frequently went into samādhi? After a long while he sighed and restrained his emotion as
if with great difficulty.

It was about ten o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on his bed, leaning against the
pillow. The devotees sat around him. Ram, Rakhal, Niranjan, Kalipada, M., and many
others were present. Sri Ramakrishna was talking about his nephew Hriday.
