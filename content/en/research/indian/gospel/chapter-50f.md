Saturday, April 17, 1886

It was the night of the full moon. For some time Narendra had been going to
Dakshineswar daily. He spent a great deal of time in the panchavati in meditation and
contemplation. This day he returned from Dakshineswar in the evening. Tārak and Kāli
were with him.

It was 8pm. Moonlight and the south wind added to the charm of the garden house. Many of the devotees were meditating in the room downstairs. 

Referring to them, Narendra said to M., "They are shedding their Upādhis one by one."
A few minutes later M. came into Sri Ramakrishna's room and sat down on the floor.
The Master asked him to wash his towel and the spittoon. M. washed them in the
reservoir.

## Master's anxiety about M.'s wife

Next morning Sri Ramakrishna sent for M. After taking his bath in the Ganges and
saluting the Master, he had gone to the roof. Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to bring his
grief-stricken wife to the garden house, where she could have her meal.
The Master said to M., by a sign: "Ask her to come. Let her stay here a couple of days.

She may bring the baby."

M: "Yes, sir. It would be fine if she developed intense love of God."

Sri Ramakrishna again answered by signs: "Oh, grief pushes out devotion. And, he was
such a big boy!"Krishnakishore had two sons. They were of the same age as Bhavanāth, and each had
two university degrees. They both died. And Krishnakishore, Jnāni that he was, could not at first control himself. How lucky I am that I have none! 

"Arjuna was a great Jnāni; and Krishna was his constant companion. Nevertheless, he
was completely overwhelmed with grief at the death of his son Abhimanyu.
"Why doesn't Kishori come?"
A DEVOTEE: "He comes to the Ganges every day for his bath."
MASTER: "But why doesn't he come here?"
DEVOTEE: "I shall ask him to come, sir."

MASTER: "Why doesn't Harish come?"

Two young girls aged nine and ten, who belonged to M.'s family, sang several songs
about the Divine Mother for the Master. They had sung for him when he had visited M.'s
house at Syampukur. The Master was very much pleased with their songs. After they
had finished, they were sent for by the devotees to sing for them downstairs.

MASTER (to M.): "Don't teach the girls any more songs. It is different if they sing
spontaneously. But they will lose their modesty by singing before anyone and everyone.
It is very necessary for women to be modest."

Flowers and sandal-paste were placed before the Master in a flower-basket. He sat on
his bed and worshipped himself with these offerings. Sometimes he placed flowers and
sandal-paste on his head, sometimes on his throat, sometimes on his heart, and
sometimes on his navel.

Manomohan of Konnagar came in and took a seat after saluting the Master. Sri
Ramakrishna was still busy with the worship of his inner Self. He put a garland of flowers
on his own neck. After a while he seemed to be pleased with Manomohan and gave him
some flowers. M., too, received a flower.
It was about nine o'clock in the morning. The Master and M: were talking. Śaśi was also
in the room.

MASTER (to M.): "What were Narendra and Śaśi talking about? What did they discuss?"
M. (to Śaśi): "What were you talking about?"

ŚAŚI: "Was it Niranjan that told you about it?"

MASTER: "What were you discussing? I heard 'God', 'Being', 'Non-being', and so forth."ŚAŚI (smiling): "Shall I call Narendra?"

MASTER: "Yes."

Narendra came in and took a seat.

MASTER (to M.): "Ask him something. (To Narendra) Tell us what you were talking
about."

NARENDRA: "I have indigestion. What's there to tell you about?"

MASTER: "You will get over your indigestion."

M. (smiling): 'Tell us about the experience of Buddha."

NARENDRA: "Have I become a Buddha, that you want me to talk about him?"

M: "What does Buddha say about the existence of God?"

NARENDRA: "How can you say that God exists? It is you who have created this universe.

Don't you know what Berkeley says about it?"

M: "Yes, I do. According to him,
<!-- esse is percipi . -->

The world exists as long as the sense-organs perceive it."

MASTER: " 'Nangta used to say, The world exists in mind alone and disappears in mind alone.' But as long as 'I-consciousness' exists, one should assume the servant-and-master relationship with God."

NARENDRA (to M:): "How can you prove by reasoning that God exists? But if you depend
on faith, then you must accept the relationship of servant and Master. And if you accept
that-and you can't help it-then you must also say that God is kind.

"You think only of the suffering in the world-why do you forget that God has also given
you so much happiness? How kind He is to us! He has granted us three very great
things: human birth, the yearning to know God, and the companionship of a great soul."
All were silent.

MASTER (to Narendra): "I feel very clearly that there is Someone within me.
Dr. Rajendralal arrived and took a seat. He had been treating the Master with
homeopathic medicine. When the talk about medicine was over, Sri Ramakrishna pointed
out Manomohan to the doctor.

RAJENDRA: "He is a distant relative of mine."Narendra went downstairs. He was singing to himself:
Lord, Thou hast lifted all my sorrow with the vision of
Thy face, And the magic of Thy beauty has bewitched my mind;
Beholding Thee, the seven worlds forget their never-
ending woe;

What shall I say, then, of myself, a poor and lowly soul?
. . .
Narendra had a little indigestion. He said to M.: "If one follows the path of bhakti, then
the mind comes down a little to the body. Otherwise, who am I? Neither man nor God. I
have neither pleasure nor pain."

It was about nine o'clock in the evening. Surendra and a few other devotees entered Sri
Ramakrishna's room and offered him garlands of flowers. Baburam, Lātu, and M. were
also in the room. Sri Ramakrishna put Surendra's garland on his own neck. All sat
quietly.
Suddenly the Master made a sign to Surendra to come near him. When the disciple came
near the bed, Sri Ramakrishna took the garland from his neck and put it around

Surendra's. Surendra saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna asked him, by a sign, to rub
his feet. Surendra gave them a gentle massage.
Several devotees were sitting on the bank of the reservoir in the garden, singing to the
accompaniment of drum and cymbals. Sri Ramakrishna sent them word through Lātu to
sing the name of Hari.
M., Baburam, and several others were still sitting in the Master's room. They heard the
devotees singing:

There dances my Gora, chanting Hari's name! . . .
When the Master heard the song he made a sign to Baburam and M. to join them. He
also asked them to dance.
A few minutes later Sri Ramakrishna sent another devotee to the singers to ask them to
sing the following improvised lines: "Ah, my Gora even knows how to dance!" "How can I
describe my Gora's moods?" "My Gora dances with both his hands upraised."
The music was over. Surendra was almost in an ecstatic mood. He sang:

Crazy is my Father, crazy is my Mother,
And I, their son, am crazy too!
Syama is my Mother's name.

My Father strikes His cheeks and makes a hollowsound:
Ba-ba-bom! Ba-ba-bom!
And my Mother, drunk and reeling,
Falls across my Father's body!
Syama's streaming tresses hang in vast disorder;

Bees are swarming numberless
About Her crimson Lotus Feet.
Listen, as She dances, how Her anklets ring!
