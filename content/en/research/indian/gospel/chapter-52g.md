Narendra and Prasanna were talking in the meditation room. Rakhal, Harish, and the younger Gopal were seated in another part of the room. After a while the elder Gopal came in. Narendra was reading from the Gitā and explaining the verses to Prasanna:_

The Lord, O Arjuna, dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing them, by His māyā, to revolve as if mounted on a machine. Take refuge in Him with all thy heart, O Bharata. By His grace wilt thou attain Supreme Peace and the Eternal Abode.  

Relinquishing all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I shall liberate thee from all sins. Grieve not.

{{< l a="Narendra" >}}
Did you notice what Krishna said?  
'Mounted on a machine.' The Lord, by His māyā, causes all beings to revolve as if mounted on a machine. To seek to know God? You are but a worm among worms—and you to know God? Just reflect a moment: what is a man? It is said that each one of the myriads of stars that shine overhead represents a solar system. This earth of ours is a part of only one solar system, and even that is too big for us. Like an insect man walks about on this earth, which, compared to the sun, is only a tiny ball.

M. (to himself): "Ah! Rakhal is right. Therefore a person like Sri Ramakrishna is
described as the 'Ocean of Mercy without any reason'."

Prasanna (to Rakhal ): "Don't you yourself feel like running away from here?"

Rakhal: "Yes, now and then I have a fancy to spend a few days on the bank of the Narmada. I say to myself, 'Let me go to a place like that and practise sādhanā in a garden.' Again, I feel a strong desire to practise the Panchatapa for three days. But I hesitate to live in a garden that belongs to worldly people."


## Tārak and Prasanna

Tārak and Prasanna were talking in the room of the "Dānās". Tārak had lost his mother.
His father, like Rakhal 's father, had married a second time. Tārak himself had married
but had lost his wife. Now the monastery was his home. He too was trying to persuade
Prasanna to live there.

Prasanna: "I have neither jnāna nor prema. What have I in the world for a support?"

TĀRAK: "It is no doubt difficult to attain jnāna; but how can you say you have no
prema?"

Prasanna: "I have not yet wept for God. How can I say I have prema? What have I
realized in all these days?"

TĀRAK: "But you have seen the Master. And why do you say that you have no jnāna?"
Prasanna: "What sort of jnāna are you talking about? Jnāna means Knowledge.
Knowledge of what? Certainly of God. But I am not even sure of the existence of God."TĀRAK: "Yes, that's true. According to the Jnāni, there is no God."

M. (to himself): "Ah! The Master used to say that those who seek God pass through the
state that Prasanna is now experiencing. In that state sometimes one doubts the very
existence of God. I understand that Tārak is now reading Buddhistic philosophy. That is
why he says that according to the Jnāni God does not exist. But Sri Ramakrishna used to
say that the Jnāni and the bhakta will ultimately arrive at the same destination."

Narendra asks Prasanna to practise self-surrender

Narendra and Prasanna were talking in the meditation room. Rakhal , Harish, and the
younger Gopal were seated in another part of the room. After a while the elder Gopal
came in. Narendra was reading from the Gitā and explaining the verses to Prasanna:
The Lord, O Arjuna, dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing them, by His māyā,
to revolve as if mounted on a machine. Take refuge in Him with all thy heart, O
Bharata. By His grace wilt thou attain Supreme Peace and the Eternal Abode.
Relinquishing all dharmas, take refuge in Me alone. I shall liberate thee from all
sins. Grieve not.

NARENDRA: "Did you notice what Krishna said?

'Mounted on a machine.' The Lord, by His māyā, causes all beings to revolve as if mounted on a machine. To seek to know
God? You are but a worm among worms-and you to know God? Just reflect a moment:
what is a man? It is said that each one of the myriads of stars that shine overhead
represents a solar system. This earth of ours is a part of only one solar system, and
even that is too big for us. Like an insect man walks about on this earth, which,
compared to the sun, is only a tiny ball."

Narendra sang:

We are born, O Lord, in the dust of earth,
And our eyes are blinded by the dust;
With dust we toy like children at play:
O give us assurance, Thou Help of the weak!
Wilt Thou cast us out of Thy lap, O Lord,
For a single mistake? Wilt Thou turn away
And abandon us to our helplessness?
Oh, then we shall never be able to rise,
But shall lie for ever dazed and undone.
Mere babes are we, Father, with baby minds;
At every step we stumble and fall.
Why, then, must Thou show us Thy terrible face?
Why, Lord, must we ever behold Thy frown?
Small are we-oh, do not be angry with us,
But tenderly speak to us when we do wrong;
For though Thou dost raise us a hundred times,A hundred times we shall fall again!
What else can one do with a helpless mind?
Then he said to Prasanna: "Surrender yourself at His feet. Resign your self completely to
His will."

Narendra sang again in an ecstatic mood:

O Lord, I am Thy servant, I am Thy servant! Thy servant
am I!
O Lord, Thou art my Master, Thou art my Master! My
Master art Thou!
From Thee I have received two pieces of bread and a
kaupin;
When I sing Thy name, devotion wells up in my heart
and shields me from harm.
Thou art the Master, the All-compassionate; this I
repeat, O Lord!
Thy servant Kabir has taken refuge at Thy feet.

Narendra said to Prasanna: "Don't you remember Sri Ramakrishna's words? God is the
hill of sugar and you are but an ant. One grain is enough to fill your stomach, and you
think of bringing home the entire hill! Don't you remember what the Master said about
Sukadeva? Even Sukadeva was a big ant at the most. That is why I scolded Kāli, saying:
'You fool! Do you want to measure God with your tape and foot-rule?'

"God is the Ocean of Mercy. Be His slave and take refuge in Him. He will show
compassion. Pray to Him: 'Protect me always with Thy compassionate face. Lead me
from the unreal to the Real, from darkness to Light, from death to Immortality. Reveal
Thyself to me and protect me always with Thy compassionate face.' "

Prasanna: "What kind of spiritual discipline should one practise?"

NARENDRA: "Repeat His name. That's enough. Don't you remember Sri Ramakrishna's song?"

Narendra sang:
O Syama, my only hope is in Thy hallowed name!
What need have I of kosha and kushi? What need of
smiles and conventions?
Thy name dissolves death's bonds, as Śiva has
proclaimed,
And I myself am Śiva's servant; whom else should I
obey?
O Mother come what may, I shall repeat Thy name;Why should I fret myself to death? To Śiva's words I
cling.
He sang again:
Mere babes are we, Father, with baby minds;
At every step we stumble and fall.
Why, then, must Thou show us Thy terrible face?
Why, Lord, must we ever behold Thy frown?

Prasanna: "Now you are saying that there is a God. Again, it is you who say that
according to Chārvāka and many other thinkers the world was self-created."

NARENDRA: "Haven't you studied chemistry? Who combines the different elements? It is a human hand that combines hydrogen, oxygen, and electricity to prepare water.

Everybody admits the existence of an Intelligent Force-a Force that is the essence of
Knowledge and that guides all these phenomena."

Prasanna: "How are we to know that God is kind?"

NARENDRA: "The Vedas say, 'That which is Thy compassionate face.' John Stuart Mill
said the same thing. He said, 'How much kindness must He have, who has implanted
kindness in the hearts of men.' The Master used to say: 'Faith is the one essential thing. God exists. He is very near us. Through faith alone one sees Him.' "

Narendra sang:

Where are you seeking Me, My servant? I am very close
to you.
Far away you still are seeking, though I am so very
near.
I am not in skin or hair, I am not in bones or flesh,
Not in mosque and not in temple, not in Kasi or Kailas.
Never will you come on Me in Ayodhya or Dwaraka;
But you will be sure to find Me if you search where faith
abides.
Not in pleasant tasks or yoga, not in vairāgya or
sannyās,
Yet I come without delaying if you only search for Me.
Prasanna: "Sometimes you say that God does not exist, and now you are saying all
these things! You are not consistent. You keep changing your opinions."

All laughed.

NARENDRA: "All right! I shall never change what I have just said. As long as one has
desires and cravings, so long one doubts the existence of God. A man cherishes somedesire or other. Perhaps he has the desire to study or pass the university examination or
become a scholar, and so forth and so on."

Narendra sang again, in a voice choked with emotion:
Hail to Thee, our God and Lord! Hail, Giver of every
blessing!

Hail, Thou Giver of good!
O Redeemer from fear, from danger and suffering!
Upholder of the worlds!
Hail, Lord! Victory to Thee!
Unfathomable and infinite, immeasurable, beyond
compare,
O God, none equals Thee!
Lord of the Universe! O All-pervading Truth!
Thou the Ātman Supreme!
Hail, Lord! Victory to Thee!
O Thou, the All-compassionate One, adored by the
whole universe,
I bow before Thy feet!
Thou art the only Refuge in life and death, O Lord;
Before Thy feet I bow!
Hail, Lord! Victory to Thee!
This is our only prayer, O Lord! What other boon can
we implore?
Thus do we pray to Thee:
Grant us true wisdom here, and in the life hereafter
Reveal Thyself to us.
Hail, Lord! Victory to Thee!
Again Narendra sang, describing how very near God is to us-as near as the musk to the
deer-and exhorting his brother disciples to drink deep from the cup of Divine Bliss:
Drinking the Bliss of Hari from the cup of prema,
Sādhu, be intoxicated!
Childhood you spent in crying, and youth in women's
control;
Now, in your old age, full of phlegm and wind,
You wait for the funeral couch to bear you to the
cremation ground.
Within the musk-deer's navel the fragrant musk is found;
But how can you make it understand?
Without the proper teacher to guide him on his way,
Man, too, is blindly roaming through the world,Deluded as the foolish deer that wanders round and
round the woods.
M. heard all this from the verandah.
Narendra got up. As he left the room he remarked, "My brain is heated by talking to
these youngsters."
He met M. on the verandah and said, "Please, let us have a drink of water."
One of the members of the Math said to Narendra, "Why, then, do you say that God
does not exist?"
Narendra laughed.
