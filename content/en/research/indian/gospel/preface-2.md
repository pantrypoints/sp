The Recorder of the Gospel MAHENDRANĀTH GUPTA

In the life of the great Saviours and Prophets of the world it is often found that they are
accompanied by souls of high spiritual potency who play a conspicuous part in the
furtherance of their Master's mission. They become so integral a part of the life and work
of these great ones that posterity can think of them only in mutual association. Such is
the case with Sri Ramakrishna and M., whose diary has come to be known to the world
as the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English and as Sri Rāmakrishna Kathāmrita in
the original Bengali version.

Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, familiary known to the readers of the Gospel by his pen name
M., and to the devotees as Master Mahashay, was born on the 14th of July, 1854 as the
son of Madhusudan Gupta, an officer of the Calcutta High Court, and his wife,
Swarnamayi Devi. He had a brilliant scholastic career at Hare School and the Presidency
College at Calcutta. The range of his studies included the best that both occidental and
oriental learning had to offer. English literature, history, economics, western philosophy
and law on the one hand, and Sanskrit literature and grammar, Darsanas, Puranas,
Smritis, Jainism, Buddhism, astrology and Ayurveda on the other were the subjects in
which he attained considerable proficiency.

He was an educationist all his life both in a spiritual and in a secular sense. After he
passed out of College, he took up work as headmaster in a number of schools in
succession Narail High School, City School, Ripon College School, Metropolitan School,
Aryan School, Oriental School, Oriental Seminary and Model School. The causes of his
migration from school to school were that he could not get on with some of the
managements on grounds of principles and that often his spiritual mood drew him away
to places of pilgrimage for long periods. He worked with some of the most noted public
men of the time like Iswar Chandra Vidyāsāgar and Surendranath Banerjee. The latter
appointed him as a professor in the City and Ripon Colleges where he taught subjects
like English, philosophy, history and economics. In his later days he took over the
Morton School, and he spent his time in the staircase room of the third floor of it,
administering the school and preaching the message of the Master. 

He was much
respected in educational circles where he was usually referred to as Rector Mahashay. A
teacher who had worked under him writes thus in warm appreciation of his teaching
methods: "Only when I worked with him in school could I appreciate what a great
educationist he was. He would come down to the level of his students when teaching,
though he himself was so learned, so talented. Ordinarily teachers confine their
instruction to what is given in books without much thought as to whether the student
can accept it or not. But M., would first of all gauge how much the student could take in
and by what means. He would employ aids to teaching like maps, pictures and diagrams,
so that his students could learn by seeing. Thirty years ago (from 1953) when the
question of imparting education through the medium of the mother tongue was being
7discussed, M. had already employed Bengali as the medium of instruction in the Morton
School." (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda Part I. P. 15.)
Imparting secular education was, however, only his profession ; his main concern was
with the spiritual regeneration of man a calling for which Destiny seems to have chosen
him. From his childhood he was deeply pious, and he used to be moved very much by
Sādhus, temples and Durga Puja celebrations. The piety and eloquence of the great
Brahmo leader of the times, Keshab Chander Sen, elicited a powerful response from the
impressionable mind of Mahendra Nath, as it did in the case of many an idealistic young
man of Calcutta, and prepared him to receive the great Light that was to dawn on him
with the coming of Sri Ramakrishna into his life.

This epoch-making event of his life came about in a very strange way. M. belonged to a
joint family with several collateral members. Some ten years after he began his career
as an educationist, bitter quarrels broke out among the members of the family, driving
the sensitive M. to despair and utter despondency. He lost all interest in life and left
home one night to go into the wide world with the idea of ending his life. At dead of
night he took rest in his sister's house at Baranagar, and in the morning, accompanied
by a nephew Siddheswar, he wandered from one garden to another in Calcutta until
Siddheswar brought him to the Temple Garden of Dakshineswar where Sri Ramakrishna
was then living. After spending some time in the beautiful rose gardens there, he was
directed to the room of the Paramahamsa, where the eventful meeting of the Master and
the disciple took place on a blessed evening (the exact date is not on record) on a
Sunday in March 1882. As regards what took place on the occasion, the reader is
referred to the opening section of the first chapter of the
Gospel.

The Master, who divined the mood of desperation in M, his resolve to take leave of this
'play-field of deception', put new faith and hope into him by his gracious words of
assurance: "God forbid! Why should you take leave of this world? Do you not feel
blessed by discovering your Guru? By His grace, what is beyond all imagination or
dreams can be easily achieved!" At these words the clouds of despair moved away from
the horizon of M.'s mind, and the sunshine of a new hope revealed to him fresh vistas of
meaning in life. Referring to this phase of his life, M. used to say, "Behold! where is the
resolve to end life, and where, the discovery of God! That is, sorrow should be looked
upon as a friend of man. God is all good." (Ibid P.33.)
After this re-settlement, M's life revolved around the Master, though he continued his
professional work as an educationist. During all holidays, including Sundays, he spent his
time at Dakshineswar in the Master's company, and at times extended his stay to
several days.

It did not take much time for M. to become very intimate with the Master, or for the
Master to recognise in this disciple a divinely commissioned partner in the fulfilment of
his spiritual mission. When M. was reading out the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the Master
discovered that he had been, in a previous birth, a disciple and companion of the great
Vaishnava Teacher, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the Master even saw him 'with his
naked eye' participating in the ecstatic mass-singing of the Lord's name under the
leadership of that Divine personality. So the Master told M, "You are my own, of the
same substance as the father and the son," indicating thereby that M. was one of the
chosen few and a part and parcel of his Divine mission.
There was an urge in M. to abandon the household life and become a Sannyāsin. When
he communicated this idea to the Master, he forbade him saying," Mother has told me
that you have to do a little of Her work you will have to teach Bhagavata, the word of
God to humanity. The Mother keeps a Bhagavata Pandit with a bondage in the world!"

An appropriate allusion indeed! Bhagavata, the great scripture that has given the word
of Sri Krishna to mankind, was composed by the Sage Vyāsa under similar
circumstances. When caught up in a mood of depression like that of M, Vyāsa was
advised by the sage Nārada that he would gain peace of mind only qn composing a work
exclusively devoted to the depiction of the Lord's glorious attributes and His teachings on
Knowledge and Devotion, and the result was that the world got from Vyāsa the
invaluable gift of the Bhagavata Purana depicting the life and teachings of Sri Krishna.
From the mental depression of the modem Vyāsa, the world has obtained the
Kathāmrita (Bengali Edition) the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English.

Sri Ramakrishna was a teacher for both the Orders of mankind, Sannyāsins and
householders. His own life offered an ideal example for both, and he left behind disciples
who followed the highest traditions he had set in respect of both these ways of life. M.,
along with Nag Mahashay, exemplified how a householder can rise to the highest level of
sagehood. M. was married to Nikunja Devi, a distant relative of Keshab Chander Sen,
even when he was reading at College, and he had four children, two sons and two
daughters. The responsibility of the family, no doubt, made him dependent on his
professional income, but the great devotee that he was, he never compromised with
ideals and principles for this reason. Once when he was working as the headmaster in a
school managed by the great Vidyāsāgar, the results of the school at the public
examination happened to be rather poor, and Vidyāsāgar attributed it to M's pre-
occupation with the Master and his consequent failure to attend adequately to the school
work. M. at once resigned his post without any thought of the morrow. Within a fortnight
the family was in poverty, and M. was one day pacing up and down the verandah of his
house, musing how he would feed his children the next day. Just then a man came with
a letter addressed to 'Mahendra Babu', and on opening it, M. found that it was a letter
9from his friend Sri Surendra Nath Banerjee, asking whether he would like to take up a
professorship in the Ripon College. In this way three or four times he gave up the job
that gave him the wherewithal to support the family, either for upholding principles or
for practising spiritual Sadhanas in holy places, without any consideration of the possible
dire worldly consequences; but he was always able to get over these difficulties
somehow, and the interests of his family never suffered. In spite of his disregard for
worldly goods, he was, towards the latter part of his life, in a fairly flourishing condition
as the proprietor of the Morton School which he developed into a noted educational
institution in the city. The Lord has said in the Bhagavad Gitā that in the case of those
who think of nothing except Him, He Himself would take up all their material and
spiritual responsibilities. M. was an example of the truth of the Lord's promise.

Though his children received proper attention from him, his real family, both during the
Master's life-time and after, consisted of saints, devotees, Sannyāsins and spiritual
aspirants. His life exemplifies the Master's teaching that an ideal householder must be
like a good maid-servant of a family, loving and caring properly for the children of the
house, but knowing always that her real home and children are elsewhere. During the
Master's life-time he spent all his Sundays and other holidays with him and his devotees,
and besides listening to the holy talks and devotional music, practised meditation both
on the Personal and the Impersonal aspects of God under the direct guidance of the
Master. In the pages of the Gospel the reader gets a picture of M.'s spiritual relationship
with the Master how from a hazy belief in the Impersonal God of the Brahmos, he was
step by step brought to accept both Personality and Impersonality as the two aspects of
the same Non-dual Being, how he was convinced of the manifestation of that Being as
Gods, Goddesses and as Incarnations, and how he was established in a life that was both
of a Jnāni and of a Bhakta. This Jnāni-Bhakta outlook and way of living became so
dominant a feature of his life that Swami Raghavananda, who was very closely
associated with him during his last six years, remarks: "Among those who lived with M.
in latter days, some felt that he always lived in this constant and conscious union with
God even with open eyes (i.e., even in waking consciousness)." (Swami Raghavananda's
article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXXVII. P. 442.)
Besides undergoing spiritual disciplines at the feet of the Master, M. used to go to holy
places during the Master's life-time itself and afterwards too as a part of his
Sādhanā.

He was one of the earliest of the disciples to visit Kamarpukur, the birthplace of the
Master, in the latter's life-time itself; for he wished to practise contemplation on the
Master's early life in its true original setting. His experience there is described as follows
by Swami Nityatmananda: "By the grace of the Master, he saw the entire Kamarpukur as
a holy place bathed in an effulgent Light. Trees and creepers, beasts and birds and men
all were made of effulgence. So he prostrated to all on the road. He saw a torn cat,
which appeared to him luminous with the Light of Consciousness. Immediately he fell to
the ground and saluted it" (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda
vol. I. P. 40.) He had similar experience in Dakshineswar also. At the instance of the
Master he also visited Puri, and in the words of Swami Nityatmananda, "with indomitable
courage, M. embraced the image of Jagannath out of season."

The life of Sādhanā and holy association that he started on at the feet of the Master, he
continued all through his life. He has for this reason been most appropriately described
as a Grihastha-Sannyāsi (householder-Sannyāsin). Though he was forbidden by the
Master to become a Sannyāsin, his reverence for the Sannyāsa ideal was whole-hearted
and was without any reservation. So after Sri Ramakrishna's passing away, while several
of the Master's householder devotees considered the young Sannyāsin disciples of the
Master as inexperienced and inconsequential, M. stood by them with the firm faith that
the Master's life and message were going to be perpetuated only through them. Swami
Vivekananda wrote from America in a letter to the inmates of the Math: "When Sri
Thākur (Master) left the body, every one gave us up as a few unripe urchins. But M. and
a few others did not leave us in the lurch. We cannot repay our debt to them." (Swami
Raghavananda's article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXX P. 442.)
M. spent his weekends and holidays with the monastic brethren who, after the Master's
demise, had formed themselves into an Order with a Math at Baranagore, and
participated in the intense life of devotion and meditation that they followed. At other
times he would retire to Dakshineswar or some garden in the city and spend several
days in spiritual practice taking simple self-cooked food. In order to feel that he was one
with all mankind he often used to go out of his home at dead of night, and like a
wandering Sannyāsin, sleep with the waifs on some open verandah or footpath on the
road.
