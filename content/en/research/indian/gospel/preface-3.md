After the Master's demise, M. went on pilgrimage several times. He visited Banāras, Vrindāvan, Ayodhyā and other places. At Banāras he visited the famous Trailinga Swāmi and fed him with sweets, and he had long conversations with Swami Bhaskarananda,
one of the noted saintly and scholarly Sannyāsins of the time. 

In 1912 he went with the Holy Mother to Banāras, and spent about a year in the company of Sannyāsins at
Banāras, Vrindāvan, Hardwar, Hrishikesh and Swargashram. But he returned to Calcutta,
as that city offered him the unique opportunity of associating himself with the places
hallowed by the Master in his life-time. Afterwards he does not seem to have gone to
any far-off place, but stayed on in his room in the Morton School carrying on his spiritual
ministry, speaking on the Master and his teachings to the large number of people who
flocked to him after having read his famous Kathāmrita known to English readers as The
Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.

This brings us to the circumstances that led to the writing and publication of this
monumental work, which has made M. one of the immortals in hagiographic literature.
While many educated people heard Sri Ramakrishna's talks, it was given to this
illustrious personage alone to leave a graphic and exact account of them for posterity,
with details like date, hour, place, names and particulars about participants. Humanity
owes this great book to the ingrained habit of diary-keeping with which M. was endowed.

Even as a boy of about thirteen, while he was a student in the 3rd class of the Hare School, he was in the habit of keeping a diary. "Today on rising," he wrote in his diary, "I 11greeted my father and mother, prostrating on the ground before them" (Swami Nityatmananda's 'M The Apostle and the Evangelist' Part I. P 29.) At another place he
wrote, "Today, while on my way to school, I visited, as usual, the temples of Kāli, the
Mother at Tharitharia, and of Mother Sitala, and paid my obeisance to them." 

About 25 years after, when he met the Great Master in the spring of 1882, it was the same instinct of a born diary-writer that made him begin his book, 'unique in the literature of hagiography', with the memorable words: "When hearing the name of Hari
or Rāma once, you shed tears and your hair stands on end, then you may know for
certain that you do not have to perform devotions such as Sandhya any more."

In addition to this instinct for diary-keeping, M. had great endowments contributing to
success in this line. Writes Swami Nityatmananda who lived in close association with M.,
in his book entitled M - The Apostle and Evangelist: "M.'s prodigious memory
combined with his extraordinary power of imagination completely annihilated the
distance of time and place for him. Even after the lapse of half a century he could always
visualise vividly, scenes from the life of Sri Ramakrishna. Superb too was his power to
portray pictures by words."

Besides the prompting of his inherent instinct, the main inducement for M. to keep this
diary of his experiences at Dakshineswar was his desire to provide himself with a means
for living in holy company at all times. Being a school teacher, he could be with the
Master only on Sundays and other holidays, and it was on his diary that he depended for
'holy company' on other days. The devotional scriptures like the Bhagavata say that holy
company is the first and most important means for the generation and growth of
devotion. For, in such company man could hear talks on spiritual matters and listen to
the glorification of Divine attributes, charged with the fervour and conviction emanating
from the hearts of great lovers of God. Such company is therefore the one certain means
through which Sraddha (Faith), Rati (attachment to God) and Bhakti (loving devotion)
are generated. 

The diary of his visits to Dakshineswar provided M. with material for re-living, through reading and contemplation, the holy company he had had earlier, even on days when he was not able to visit Dakshineswar. The wealth of details and the vivid description of men and things in the midst of which the sublime conversations are set,
provide excellent material to re-live those experiences for any one with imaginative
powers. It was observed by M.'s disciples and admirers that in later life also whenever
he was free or alone, he would be pouring over his diary, transporting himself on the wings of imagination to the glorious days he spent at the feet of the Master. 

During the Master's life-time M. does not seem to have revealed the contents of his diary
to any one. There is an unconfirmed tradition that when the Master saw him taking notes, he expressed apprehension at the possibility of his utilising these to publicise him like Keshab Sen; for the Great Master was so full of the spirit of renunciation and humility that he disliked being lionised. It must be for this reason that no one knew
about this precious diary of M. for a decade until he brought out selections from it as a
pamphlet in English in 1897 with the Holy Mother's blessings and permission. 

The Holy Mother, being very much pleased to hear parts of the diary read to her in Bengali, wrote Kathāmrita, (Bengali name of the book) I felt as if it was he, the Master, who was saying all that." (Ibid Part I. P 37.)
to M.: "When I heard the

The two pamphlets in English entitled the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna appeared in October and November 1897. They drew the spontaneous acclamation of Swami Vivekananda, who wrote on 24th November of that year from Dehra Dun to M.:"Many
many thanks for your second leaflet.

It is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original,
and never was the life of a Great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the
writer's mind, as you are doing. The language also is beyond all praise, so fresh, so
pointed, and withal so plain and easy. I cannot express in adequate terms how I have
enjoyed them. I am really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't it? Our
Teacher and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have to be original or nothing.

I now understand why none of us attempted His life before. It has been reserved for
you, this great work. He is with you evidently." (Vedānta Kesari Vol. XIX P. 141. Also
given in the first edition of the Gospel published from Ramakrishna Math, Madras in 1911.)
And Swamiji added a post script to the letter: "Socratic dialogues are Plato all over you
are entirely hidden. Moreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it
here or in the West." Indeed, in order to be unknown, Mahendranath had used the pen-
name M., under which the book has been appearing till now. But so great a book cannot
remain obscure for long, nor can its author remain unrecognised by the large public in
these modern times. M. and his book came to be widely known very soon and to meet
the growing demand, a full-sized book, Vol. I of the Gospel, translated by the author
himself, was published in 1907 by the Brahmavadin Office, Madras. A second edition of
it, revised by the author, was brought out by the Ramakrishna Math, Madras in December 1911, and subsequently a second part, containing new chapters from the original Bengali, was published by the same Math in 1922. The full English translation of
the Gospel by Swami Nikhilananda appeared first in 1942.

In Bengali the book is published in five volumes, the first part having appeared in 1902
and the others in 1905, 1907, 1910 and 1932 respectively.

It looks as if M. was brought to the world by the Great Master to record his words and
transmit them to posterity. Swami Sivananda, a direct disciple of the Master and the
second President of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, says on this topic: "Whenever
there was an interesting talk, the Master would call Master Mahashay if he was not in the
room, and then draw his attention to the holy words spoken. We did not know then why
the Master did so. Now we can realise that this action of the Master had an important
significance, for it was reserved for Master Mahashay to give to the world at large the
sayings of the Master." (Vedānta Kesari Vol. XIX P 141.) Thanks to M., we get, unlike in
the case of the great teachers of the past, a faithful record with date, time, exact report
of conversations, description of concerned men and places, references to contemporary events and personalities and a hundred other details for the last four years of the Master's life (1882-'86), so that no one can doubt the historicity of the Master and his
teachings at any time in the future.

M. was a true missionary of Sri Ramakrishna right from his first
acquaintance with him in 1882. As a school teacher, it was a practice with him to direct
to the Master such of his students as had a true spiritual disposition. Though himself
prohibited by the Master to take to monastic life, he encouraged all spiritually inclined
young men he came across in his later life to join the monastic Order. Swami
Vijnanananda, a direct Sannyāsin disciple of the Master and a President of the
Ramakrishna Order, once remarked to M.: "By enquiry, I have come to the conclusion
that eighty percent and more of the Sannyāsins have embraced the monastic life after
reading the Kathāmrita (Bengali name of the book) and coming in contact with you." (M
The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda Part I, P 37.)

In 1905 he retired from the active life of a Professor and devoted his remaining twenty-
seven years exclusively to the preaching of the life and message of the Great Master. He
bought the Morton Institution from its original proprietors and shifted it to a commodious
four-storeyed house at 50 Amherst Street, where it flourished under his management as
one of the most efficient educational institutions in Calcutta. He generally occupied a
staircase room at the top of it, cooking his own meal which consisted only of milk and
rice without variation, and attended to all his personal needs himself. His dress also was
the simplest possible. It was his conviction that limitation of personal wants to the
minimum is an important aid to holy living. About one hour in the morning he would
spend in inspecting the classes of the school, and then retire to his staircase room to
pour over his diary and live in the divine atmosphere of the earthly days of the Great
Master, unless devotees and admirers had already gathered in his room seeking his holy
company.

M. looked a Vedic Rishi. Tall and stately in bearing, he had a strong and well-built body, an unusually broad chest, high forehead and arms extending to the knees. His complexion was fair and his prominent eyes were always tinged with the
expression of the divine love that filled his heart. 

Adorned with a silvery beard that flowed luxuriantly down his chest, and a shining face radiating the serenity and gravity
of holiness, M. was as imposing and majestic as he was handsome and engaging in
appearance. Humorous, sweet-tongued and eloquent when situations required, this great
Maharishi of our age lived only to sing the glory of Sri Ramakrishna day and night.
Though a very well versed scholar in the Upanishads, Gitā and the philosophies of the
East and the West, all his discussions and teachings found their culmination in the life
and the message of Sri Ramakrishna, in which he found the real explanation and
illustration of all the scriptures. Both consciously and unconsciously, he was the teacher
of the Kathāmrita the nectarine words of the Great Master.

Though a much-sought-after spiritual guide, an educationist of repute, and a contemporary and close associate of illustrious personages like Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Keshab Chander Sen and Iswar Chander Vidyāsāgar, he was always
moved by the noble humanity of a lover of God, which consists in respecting the personalities of all as receptacles of the Divine Spirit. 

So he taught without the consciousness of a teacher, and no bar of superiority stood in the way of his doing the humblest service to his students and devotees. "He was a commission of love," writes his close devotee, Swami Raghavananda, "and yet his soft and sweet words would pierce the stoniest heart, make the worldly-minded weep and repent and turn Godwards."

As time went on and the number of devotees increased, the staircase room and terrace of the 3rd floor of the Morton Institution became a veritable Naimisaranya of modern times, resounding during all hours of the day, and sometimes of night, too, with the
word of God coming from the Rishi-like face of M. addressed to the eager God-seekers
sitting around. To the devotees who helped him in preparing the text of the Gospel, he
would dictate the conversations of the Master in a meditative mood, referring now and
then to his diary. At times in the stillness of midnight he would awaken a nearby devotee
and tell him: "Let us listen to the words of the Master in the depths of the night as he
explains the truth of the Pranava." (Vedānta Kesari XIX P. 142.) Swami Raghavananda,
an intimate devotee of M., writes as follows about these devotional sittings: "In the
sweet and warm months of April and May, sitting under the canopy of heaven on the
roof-garden of 50 Amherst Street, surrounded by shrubs and plants, himself sitting in
their midst like a Rishi of old, the stars and planets in their courses beckoning us to
things infinite and sublime, he would speak to us of the mysteries of God and His love
and of the yearning that would rise in the human heart to solve the Eternal Riddle, as
exemplified in the life of his Master. The mind, melting under the influence of his soft
sweet words of light, would almost transcend the frontiers of limited existence and dare
to peep into the infinite. He himself would take the influence of the setting and say,'What
a blessed privilege it is to sit in such a setting (pointing to the starry heavens), in the
company of the devotees discoursing on God and His love!' These unforgettable scenes
will long remain imprinted on the minds of his hearers." (Prabuddha Bharata Vol XXXVII
P 497.)

About twenty-seven years of his life he spent in this way in the heart of the great city of
Calcutta, radiating the Master's thoughts and ideals to countless devotees who flocked to
him, and to still larger numbers who read his Kathāmrita (English Edition : The Gospel
of Sri Ramakrishna), the last part of which he had completed before June 1932 and given to the press. And miraculously, as it were, his end also came immediately after he had completed his life's mission. About three months earlier he had come to stay at his
home at 13/2 Gurdasprasad Chaudhuary Lane at Thakur Bari, where the Holy Mother
had herself installed the Master and where His regular worship was being conducted for
the previous 40 years. The night of 3rd June being the Phalahārini Kāli Pooja day, M.
15had sent his devotees who used to keep company with him, to attend the special
worship at Belur Math at night. After attending the service at the home shrine, he went
through the proof of the Kathāmrita for an hour. Suddenly he got a severe attack of
neuralgic pain, from which he had been suffering now and then, of late. Before 6 a.m. in
the early hours of 4th June 1932 he passed away, fully conscious and chanting:
'Gurudeva-Ma, Kole tule na-o (Take me in your arms! O Master! O Mother!!)'
