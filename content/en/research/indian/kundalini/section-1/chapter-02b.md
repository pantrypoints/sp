In the tantric texts, kundalini is conceived of as the primal power or energy. 

In modern psychology, it can be called the unconscious in man. As we have just discussed, in Hindu mythology, kundalini corresponds with the concept of Kali. 

In the philosophy of Shaivism, the concept of kundalini is represented by the shivalingam, the
oval-shaped stone or pillar with a snake coiled around it.

However, most commonly, kundalini is illustrated as a sleeping serpent coiled three
and a half times. 

Of course there is no serpent residing in mooladhara, sahasrara or any
other chakra, but the serpent has always been a symbol for efficient consciousness. 

In all
the oldest mystic cults of the world you find the serpent, and if you have seen any
pictures or images of Lord Shiva, you will have noticed serpents girdling his waist, neck
and arms. 

Kali is also adorned with serpents and Lord Vishnu eternally reposes on a large
coiled serpent. 

This serpent power symbolizes the unconscious in man.

In Scandinavian, European, Latin American and Middle Eastern countries and many
different civilizations of the world, the concept of the serpent power is represented in
monuments and ancient artifacts.

This means kundalini was known to people from all parts of the world in the past. However, we can conceive kundalini in any manner we like because actually, prana has no form or dimension, it is infinite.

In the traditional descriptions of kundalini awakening, it is said that kundalini resides in mooladhara in the form of a coiled snake and when the snake awakens it uncoils and shoots up through sushumna (the psychic passage in the center of the spinal cord), opening the other chakras as it goes (see Sir John Woodroffe's The Serpent Power).

Brahmachari Swami Vyasdev, in his book Science of the Soul, describes the awakening of kundalini:

{{< l a="Swami Vyasdev" >}}
Sadhakas have seen the sushumna in the form of a luminous rod or pillar, a golden yellow snake, or sometimes as a shining black snake about ten inches long with blood redeyes like smouldering charcoal, the front part of the tongue vibrating and shining like lightning, ascending the spinal column.
{{< /l >}}

The meaning of the 3 1/2 coils of the serpent is as follows.

The 3 coils represent:
- the 3 matras of Om, which relate to past, present and future
- the 3 gunas: tamas, rajas and sattva
- the 3 states of consciousness: waking, sleeping and dreaming
- the 3 types of experience: subjective experience, sensual experience and absence of experience

The 1/2 coil represents the state of transcendence, where there is neither waking, sleeping nor
dreaming. 

So, the 3 1/2 coils signify the total experience of the universe and the
experience of transcendence.


### Who can awaken kundalini?

There are many people who have awakened their kundalini: saints, sadhus, poets, painters, warriors, writers, etc.

Anyone can awaken their kundalini. 

With the awakening of kundalini, not only visions of God take place, there is dawning of creative intelligence and an awakening of supramental faculties. By activating kundalini you may become anything in life.

The energy of kundalini is one energy, but it expresses itself differently through the individual psychic centers or chakras - first in gross instinctive ways and then in
progressively more subtle ways. Refining of the expression of this energy at higher and more subtle levels of vibration represents the ascent of human consciousness to its
highest possibilities. 

Kundalini is the creative energy; it is the energy of self-expression. Just as in reproduction a new life is created, in the same way, someone like Einstein uses that same
energy in a different, more subtle realm, to create a theory like relativity. 

It is the same energy that is expressed when someone composes or plays beautiful music. It is the same energy which is expressed in all parts of life, whether it is building up a business, fulfilling the family duties or reaching whatever goal you aspire for. These are all expressions of the same creative energy.

Everybody, whether householder or sannyasin, must remember that awakening of kundalini is the prime purpose of human incarnation. All the pleasures of sensual life
which we are enjoying now are intended only to enhance the awakening of kundalini amidst the adverse circumstances of man's life.


### A process of metamorphosis

With the awakening of kundalini, a transformation takes place in life. It has little to do with one's moral, religious or ethical life. It has more to do with the quality of our experiences and perceptions. When kundalini wakes up your mind changes and your priorities and attachments also change. All your karmas undergo a process of integration.

It is very simple to understand. When you were a child you loved toys, but why don't you love them now? Because your mind has changed and consequently, your attachments
have also changed. So, with the awakening of kundalini, a metamorphosis takes place.

There is even the possibility of restructuring the entire physical body.

When kundalini awakens, the physical body actually undergoes many changes.

Generally they are positive, but if your guru is not cautious, they can be negative also.

When the shakti wakes up, the cells in the body are completely charged and a process of
rejuvenation also starts. The voice changes, the smell of the body changes and the
hormonal secretions also change. 

In fact, the transformation of cells in the body and brain
takes place at a much higher rate than normal. These are just a few observations.
However, scientific researchers are still taking their first steps into this field.


### Why awaken kundalini?

If you want to take up the practice of kundalini yoga, the most important thing is that
you have a reason or an aim.

If you want to awaken kundalini for psychic powers, then
please go ahead with your own destiny. 

But if you want to awaken kundalini in order to
enjoy communion between Shiva and Shakti, the actual communion between the two
great forces within you, and if you want to enter samadhi and experience the absolute in
the cosmos, and if you want to understand the truth behind the appearance, and if the
purpose of your pilgrimage is very great, then there is nothing that can come to you as an
obstacle.

By means of kundalini awakening, you are compensating with the laws of nature and
speeding up the pace of your physical, mental and spiritual evolution. Once the great
shakti awakens, man is no longer a gross physical body operating with a lower mind and
low voltage prana. Instead, every cell of his body is charged with the high voltage prana
of kundalini. And when total awakening occurs, man becomes a junior god, an
embodiment of divinity.
