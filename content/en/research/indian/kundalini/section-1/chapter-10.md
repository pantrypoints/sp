When we talk about awakening we should not confuse awakening of kundalini with
other forms of awakening. Awakening of the chakras is completely different from
awakening of kundalini. Awakening of sushumna is also quite a different event, and
awakening of mooladhara chakra is not awakening of kundalini. Even if all the chakras
from mooladhara up to ajna are awakened this does not mean that kundalini is awakened.
In the systematic process of awakening kundalini, the first step is to purify ida and
pingala nadis and create harmony in their functioning. Next, all the chakras have to be
awakened. Then sushumna nadi is awakened, and when there is a clear pathway for its
ascent, kundalini can be awakened.

If the first three steps have been taken, awakening of kundalini will only have
positive effects. But if they have been neglected and kundalini awakens, there will
definitely be some negative results. Supposing you have awakened kundalini before
sushumna awakening has taken place, then the shakti will not find a channel towards
Shiva. It will remain obstructed in mooladhara chakra and will create tremendous sexual
and neurotic problems. This is a negative result because you wanted to unite with Shiva
and have higher experiences, whereas now you are experiencing the grosser things. And
if the chakras are not awakened before kundalini, the shakti will get blocked in one of the
chakras and remain stagnant, possibly for years. Some siddhis may develop and you may
not be able to transcend them at all. This is also a negative effect.
Each form of awakening has its own psychic potential. Every nerve and fiber of your
body is psychic; it is capable of producing psychic manifestations. There is a possibility
of awakening the entire physical body. Every cell of the body is one individual. You are
the macro-cosmic body for that microcosmic individual.


### Step 1: Disciplining ida and pingala

Ida and pingala nadis are responsible for the mundane existence. Pingala conducts the
life that is in your body and ida conducts the consciousness. These two nadis respectively
feed the two hemispheres of the brain which in turn control every activity of the body. It
is not awakening of these nadis we aim towards, but discipline. As you know, ida and
pingala function alternately and directly influence the temperature of the body, digestive
and hormonal secretions, the brainwaves and all the bodily systems.
Ida and pingala function according to a natural cycle, but on account of poor eating
habits and inharmonious lifestyles, the natural cycle is often disturbed. Sometimes one
nadi predominates and the other is suppressed. This leads to mental and physical
imbalances and generally results in disease. Therefore, ida and pingala must be
disciplined or made to function according to the laws of nature. Only when there is
harmony between these two nadis can sushumna be awakened.
So, through the practices of hatha yoga, pranayama and raja yoga, the nadis should be
purified and disciplined. The best practice for this is actually nadi shodhana pranayama -
nadi purifying pranayama.


### Step 2: Awakening the chakras

From incarnation to incarnation the yoga we have been practising may have already
awakened the lower chakras. Although most of us try to awaken mooladhara,
swadhisthana, etc. it may not be necessary to awaken them because we may have evolved
even beyond manipura on account of our efforts in a previous life. It is even possible that
kundalini may have ascended through the chakras but you don't know it because you
haven't noticed any symptoms. However, in any case, it is essential that all the chakras
must be awakened before we make an attempt to awaken sushumna.

If the chakras are not purified, then purification of the nadis will not serve any
purpose. If the electrical junctions are not connected or properly organized, even if you
have the best wiring available, how will the electrical energy be distributed? The chakras
are the junctions from which the nadis, like cables, transmit the energy to different parts
of the body.

Every point, speck or fiber of the body is directly related to one of the chakras. If you
experience pain in any part of the body, the sensation will go to the chakra related to that
particular area. This means your whole body is connected with one of the chakras. For
example, the urinary, excretory and reproductive systems are fed by swadhisthana chakra.
Besides this, the sexual organs are connected to mooladhara chakra. The digestive
system, small intestine, large intestine, appendix, pancreas, duodenum, stomach and liver
are all connected to manipura chakra. The heart and lungs are fed by anahata chakra.
However, in most people, the chakras beyond manipura are dormant. Because
mooladhara chakra is the highest chakra in animal evolution, it is already functioning in
most people. That is why everybody has a very acute sexual awareness and sex has
become one of the most important events in man's life. Therefore, most of our social
traditions are based upon this particular human requirement. The mere fact that today's
society is utilizing the five tattwas of tantra (meat, fish, wine, grain and sexual
interaction) in everyday life means that in most people, kundalini is somewhere between
mooladhara and swadhisthana. Once kundalini leaves swadhisthana and ascends to
manipura and anahata, you no longer need the five tattwas.

If you are stuck in mooladhara or swadhisthana, you will need to purify the higher
chakras and bring them into operation. There are many ways of doing it. For those who
are strong in mind, there are some higher practices. By concentration on bhrumadhya you
can awaken one chakra, by the practice of uddiyana bandha you can awaken another, by
practising mantra, your mantra or any bija mantra, you can awaken almost all the chakras
one by one, and as a result of this awakening, you can have very good psychic
experiences which you can easily handle. In my opinion, it is safer to awaken the chakras
by the mild methods.

The asanas are intended to create mild awakening in the chakras. For example,
sarvangasana will awaken vishuddhi, matsyasana will awaken anahata and bhujangasana
will awaken swadhisthana. By awakening the chakras mildly, you will not have any
jolting experiences. Sometimes, when a chakra awakens suddenly, you can have the
experience of lower lives. This means you can be assailed by fear, anxiety, greed,
passion, depression, etc.
Each chakra is symbolized by a certain animal, indicating a type of animal
consciousness, and if sudden awakening of a chakra takes place, you may exhibit some of
the animal emotions in either a mild or very strong way. For instance, fear is not a human
emotion, nor is infatuation or violence. Of course, man is trying to expel the animal from
him, but at the same time he is maintaining it. Therefore, care must be taken not to give
an explosive manifestation to the awakening of the chakras.


### Step 3: Awakening sushumna

In order to purify and awaken sushumna, a lot of work has to be done and you must
be ready to cope with experiences that are more intense than those associated with chakra
awakening. These experiences are beyond logic. They are not even real and they cannot
be explained or properly understood. If the chakras are awakened, ida and pingala are
balanced and the other nadis are also purified, but there is an obstruction in sushumna,
then the awakening of kundalini will not fulfil its purpose.
Actually, I don't believe ida and pingala nadis are inferior to sushumna. Awakening of
pingala nadi will awaken one portion of the brain and awakening of ida will awaken
another portion. However, when kundalini enters sushumna, it affects the whole brain.

In the ancient texts of tantra it has been clearly indicated that it does not matter if
kundalini enters another passageway. If there is an awakening in pingala, one becomes a
healer or a siddha, one who has control over nature, matter and the mind. When there is
awakening in ida, one can predict things; he becomes a prophet. But when sushumna
awakens, kundalini ascends straight to sahasrara and one becomes a jivanmukta, a
liberated soul.

So, hatha yoga and pranayama are prescribed for the awakening of sushumna. There
are also other ways, but kriya yoga is the best, particularly the practices of maha mudra
and maha bheda mudra. For awakening of sushumna, ida and pingala have to be
suppressed. Thus you can see the importance of practising kumbhaka, breath retention.
When both nadis are suppressed in kumbhaka, immediately after you'll find that both
nadis are flowing simultaneously. It is at this time that kundalini should awaken.
