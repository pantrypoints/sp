The awakening of kundalini is like a great explosion which transports a person into
another plane of being. No matter which spiritual path you follow, you must eventually
reach this domain. Ordinary consciousness and transcendental consciousness cannot be
maintained at the same time; it is necessary to pass through an intermediate zone of
change, where perceptions, feelings and experiences undergo a transformation. 

The adventure is always the same; it is a journey through the border region between the known and the unknown. At this time it is very important to recognize that this explosion signals a profound alteration in consciousness. The complete process of awakening is comprised of several stages, as the kundalini rises and passes through the various chakras.

It takes quite some time to become fully stabilized, but if one has a good
understanding, the transition process can be managed without any serious difficulties.

The preliminary awakening of kundalini is followed by the experience of light in bhrumadhya, the eyebrow center. Usually this develops in a very mild way over an extended period of time, and therefore does not precipitate any sudden agitation or disturbance. After some time, the appetite for food and sleep gradually decreases and the mind becomes quieter.

There is another prior warning which heralds the awakening of kundalini. In yoga
and tantra it is very clearly indicated that when ida and pingala flow simultaneously for a
long period of time, and sushumna begins to flow, then it is time to prepare for a spiritual
event.

Therefore, one should be conversant with swara yoga, the science of the breath cycle,
and keep a close watch over the breathing process. The breathing pattern in the nostrils
normally changes every fourth day, according to the cycles of the moon, but when both
nostrils have been functioning equally well for at least fifteen days, that is an advance
warning of an impending spiritual breakthrough.

An onslaught of experiences

When the actual awakening occurs there is an explosion in the realm of experience
and there are symptoms which are sometimes very difficult to understand. The most
unique and common experience is the release of energy like an electric shock from the
bottom of the spinal cord, as if it were connected to an electrical power point. 

This may
be accompanied by a burning sensation in mooladhara chakra and energy passing up and
down through sushumna. Sometimes you hear drums, flutes, bells, birds, celestial music,
or you may even think you can hear peacocks singing. You may have a very momentary
sensation of sitting outside in the middle of a monsoon shower, and there can also be the
sensation of dark clouds in continual movement overhead and the sound of thunder.
At times your body feels so light and you may even visualize your spinal cord as a
fluorescent light. It is common to feel illumination within, as if hundreds of little lights
were burning inside your body. This is one side.

The other side is that all the anger, passions and suppressions come out. Sometimes
you are so filled with fear that you can't sleep, sometimes for days together you have
nothing in your mind but sex, at other times you can't think of anything but food.
However, all these symptoms pass within a few days or weeks.

Some people obtain psychic powers. They develop clairvoyance, telepathy,
clairaudience, psychotelekinesis, the ability to heal, etc., and this brings a lot of
temptations. However, this is a phase and it will pass away.

Sometimes you don't feel like eating for days together. You may not have any
appetite for fifteen to twenty days, and even if people try to force you to eat, you just
can't. There is sometimes a feeling of nervous depression, and you may just want to sit, or
you may feel restricted and closed in. There is a detachment from the normal emotions of
life; for days together you may live a life of utter dispassion. 

Nothing is interesting in life
and everything and everybody seems as dry as a desert. But at the same time, the mind
becomes very dynamic and appears to be formless. Various sensations, poetic emotions
and artistic perceptions also occur, such as visions of angels and divinities. All kinds of
things can emerge from the depths of the mind. However, these are just a few of the
symptoms you may experience, but all of them pass away quickly.

The storm always settles and then the yogi lives a very normal life. Externally his life
seems the same as anybody else's but his inner awareness is far greater and more vast.

## Headaches and insomnia

Some aspirants experience terrible headaches when kundalini is awakening, however,
this does not mean that all headaches are related to kundalini. And not everybody will
have headaches. Generally, those who have had married life do not have this experience.
It is usually only those who have not had any kind of sexual interactions who experience
headaches with the advent of kundalini awakening.

There is also another explanation about headaches. One-tenth of the brain is active
and nine-tenths are not. In some cases, when the silent areas of the brain begin to wake
up, the first symptom is headache. People have equated this experience with labor pain.
Just as a woman experiences labor pain when she is about to give birth to a child, when
the silent areas of the brain are about to become active and you are giving birth to
spiritual consciousness, there is also pain.

Therefore, one has to bear with this pain for some time, but it will inevitably settle
down. Of course you can reduce the pain by adjusting your diet and lifestyle, but under
no circumstances should you use sedatives, aspirins or pain relieving pills.

It is also likely that an aspirant will experience insomnia. However, yogis don't call it
insomnia. They say, 'Why should I sleep?' If you love a person very much and he stays
with you and does not allow you to sleep, will you call that insomnia? So, all the people
who do not sleep are not yogis. Only those people are yogis who do not sleep and are
happy about it, because yogis have an entirely different attitude. They say one-third of
life is wasted in sleeping.

So, when kundalini awakens in a yogi and consciousness is constant and consistent,
and there is no waking, sleeping and dreaming, they are very happy about it. Therefore,
insomnia does not usually bother a person who has awakened kundalini. However, if you
are disturbed by your inability to sleep, you should never resort to sleeping pills or
tranquillizers. It is also not necessary that you practise yoga to induce sleep. Just accept
your sleeplessness and enjoy it. You can do japa or meditation or just do some spiritual
reflection. If this is not possible, just lie down and let it happen as it will.
Experiencing the threefold awakenings

Each of the three forms of awakening - nadis, chakras and sushurnna is accompanied
by its own set of experiences. Many aspirants have psychic experiences and they think
they indicate the awakening of kundalini, but this is not so.
When the chakras are awakening, the experiences one has are not so frightening and
critical. They are usually of a fantastic nature, very pleasant, hallucinating and
comfortable. Even if you have an experience of fear or terror, it does not shake your
mind. When we have experiences of our ishta devata or guru, or we have some
experience in meditation or during kirtan, and it feels very nice, that represents chakra
awakening and not kundalini awakening. When you experience a chakra awakening it is
rather beautiful and leaves a comfortable or blissful feeling. That is to encourage you to
go further.
When awakening takes place in sushumna, you may feel or see a rod of light, or your
spinal cord may seem to be fully illumined from within. Such experiences are described
by the saints of different religions in their poems, songs and stories, which are
unfortunately understood by very few people today.
The awakening of sushumna can also bring some mind exploding experiences which
are sometimes very confusing. You can smell pleasant and unpleasant odors, you will
hear shrieks and screams as if the ghosts are crying, and there is a feeling of heat,
creeping sensations and pain in different parts of the body. You may get a high fever or
manifest the symptoms of some common disease or some baffling illness which medical
experts find difficult to analyze.

At the time of sushumna awakening, the quality and experience of the mind begin to
change. One has the experience of depression, anorexia and loneliness. You begin to
realize the inner essence. Matter appears to be nothing, and even your body feels as if it
were only made up of air. Or you may feel that you are not part of this physical body, you
are someone else. When you look at people, animals and the objects of nature - the
flowers, trees, rivers and mountains, etc., you feel a communication with them.

At this time, you also experience prophetic vision, but your visions or forewarnings
may not be clear and you only foresee the bad things - imminent perils, accidents,
disasters and catastrophies. Throughout the awakening one generally has an aversion to
work and can't really apply himself to anything.

It is actually best if an aspirant is near his guru at this time of awakening so he can
explain what is happening. The sadhaka is not merely making a transition from one state
of mind to another, he is actually jumping from one state to another. It is also very
difficult for even an expert guru to handle these matters unless the disciple has totally
accepted him as his guru.


### Differentiating the experiences

You must remember that when you have certain visions and fantastic experiences,
they do not necessarily represent the awakening of kundalini or even sushumna nadi.
They may indicate chakra awakening or they may just be the expression of your
archetypes or samskaras. Because of your sadhana, concentration or one-pointedness, you
may be allowing an outlet for your deep-rooted samskaras to express themselves.

These experiences and those that accompany chakra awakening do not mean anything
when you try to assess them. I will give you an example. Many years ago, I was
meditating on the bank of the Ganga in Rishikesh and suddenly I had a very vivid
experience. I saw the whole earth split into two. It was a very clear vision, and I
remember it even today, but this vision had nothing to do with reality; I just had it. This
was an experience of chakra awakening.

When the actual awakening of kundalini takes place, it is a great event in man's life.
Every experience has a tangible proof, whether it is awakening of extrasensory
perceptions or the awakening of a particular kind of genius. It may be in the form of a
philosophy you are able to deliver to the people, a transformation in the physical
elements of the body that you are able to materialize, or a magnetic influence that you are
able to cast on the masses of people as a politician, musician or saint.

The awakening of kundalini has tangible, positive and concrete proofs. You cannot
believe your kundalini is awakened if you have no proof, because when the awakening of
kundalini takes place, you completely transcend the normal categories of mental
awareness and the scope of your knowledge becomes greater.


### A scientist who jumped beyond the mind

There was a scientist named Eddington, and he was observing the determined laws of
electrons and trying to formulate a system, a law. He succeeded, the result being the law
of determinancy.

However, once when he was studying the electrons, his vision changed entirely. He
found that the electrons were behaving in a very anarchical manner.There was no logic,
system or hypothesis behind their behavior. That was his vision, and he called it the law
of indeterminancy.

Once he was asked, 'What is this law which you have discovered behind the
mathematical and logical behavior of electrons?' He replied, 'It cannot be explained.'
Someone asked, 'How can you say that a movement in matter cannot be explained?'
Eddington answered, 'It can be explained if you can jump over the mind.'


### The process of transition

There is a natural process of transition in which a man's consciousness evolves over
the course of millions of years. It takes place in the same way that a baby develops into a
child, a child into a young man, a young man into a middle-aged man, a middle-aged man
into an old man. Suppose a child of five suddenly transformed into an old man and he
found he was tall, grey haired and speaking like an old person. It would be very difficult
for him to handle the situation and to connect both the areas of his life. This is what
generally happens with those who awaken kundalini.

Their experiences are often imbalanced and extremely difficult to understand. Just
imagine how it would be if you felt your whole body burning as if it were in flames, or
you kept feeling that a snake was crawling through your body. Imagine what it would be
like to look at somebody's face and instead of seeing the person you see a ghost. You'd
start to think you were crazy! These are just a few of the bizarre experiences you could be
confronted with. However, with the awakening of kundalini, there is also an awakening
of vairagya, detachment. And when vairagya develops the turbulence settles, the
awakening becomes peaceful and the transition is smooth.
