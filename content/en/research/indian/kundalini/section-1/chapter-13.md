Awakening of kundalini is very difficult. You can try the various yogic and religious
practices that have evolved throughout the ages, but they require a lot of self-discipline
and demanding austerities. There are so many do's and dont's that the average person
finds unpalatable. 

Therefore, the rishis of the tantric tradition evolved a series of practices
that could be easily adopted by every type of aspirant regardless of his lifestyle, habits,
beliefs, and so on. Of course there are many practices belonging to tantra, but of them all,
kriya yoga is considered to be the most powerful and suitable for the modern day man
who is enmeshed in this world.

For many years, knowledge of this system of yoga was revealed to very few. The
practices were mentioned in the tantric texts, but they were never clearly defined.
Through a tradition, the practices were handed down from guru to disciple. They were
given to both householder and monastic disciples, who soon discovered that through
these techniques, kundalini became a reality and a real experience in their lives.

The ultimate purpose of kriya yoga is to create awakening in the chakras, to purify
the nadis, and finally, to awaken the kundalini shakti. The kriyas are intended to awaken
the kundalini in stages and not abruptly. When kundalini awakens abruptly, the
experiences you have are very difficult to handle and you cannot understand what is
happening to you. The techniques of kriya yoga offer a smooth and relatively risk-free
means of expanding your awareness and awakening the dormant areas of the brain. 

Also,
this system of kriya yoga provides a means whereby you do not have to tackle the mind
directly. Its practices are based on hatha yoga, which aims at controlling the prana. Mind
and prana interact with each other and thereby, by controlling the prana, we can gain
control of the mind.

Kriya yoga offers a unique approach

Kriya yoga means 'the yoga of practice, movement or action'. Unlike the various
religious, mystical or yogic practices which demand mental control, the special
instruction in the system of kriya yoga is, 'Do not worry about the mind.' If your mind is
dissipating or if there are distractions in your mind and you are not able to concentrate
even for one second, it does not matter. You have only to continue with your practices,
for even without confronting, controlling or trying to balance the mind, you can still
evolve.

This is an entirely new concept in spiritual life, and most people have probably never
even considered it. When they take to a religion, commence spiritual practices or go to
gurus, the first thing they are told is to control the mind. 'You should think like this. Don't
think like that. You should do like this. Don't do that. This is good. This is bad. That is
evil. Do not sin.' And so on.

People think that the mind is the greatest barrier in spiritual life, but this is a very
wrong and dangerous concept. The mind is a bridge between this and that, so how can it
be a barrier? An idiot thinks it is a barrier and he tries to destroy that bridge. Then when
he has destroyed it, he wonders how he'll get to the other side. This is the ironical fate of
most people, and unfortunately it is the religions, ethics and morality that are responsible.
The people who are less aware of ethics and morality have no mental problems. They are
very good, happy-go-lucky people.
The seers and rishis of kriya yoga have said, 'Control of mind is not necessary. Just go
on practising the kriyas and let the mind do what it wants. In the course of time, the
evolution of consciousness will take you to that point where the mind will no longer
trouble you.'

Dissipation of mind is not necessarily the fault of the mind. Distractions can be due to
hormonal imbalances, bad digestion, low influx of energy in the nervous system and so
many other things. Never blame the mind for its restlessness, and don't consider yourself
to be an impure, bad or inferior person because your mind jumps all over the place,
thinking negative things and what you consider to be evil thoughts, etc.

Everybody has negative thoughts and distractions of mind, even a compassionate and
charitable person, a peaceful man, a chaste and pure person. Dozens of factors could be
the cause of a distracted mind. Suppressing the mind and calling it back again and again
is not the way to concentrate the mind, it is a way to the mental hospital.

After all, who
suppresses or calls back who? Are there two personalities or two minds in you? Is there
one bad mind which keeps wandering off and one good mind which tries to bring back
the bad mind? No, there is only one mind and you should not create a split by
antagonizing the mind. If you do this, one part of the mind becomes the dictator and
controller and the other part becomes the victim. Then you'll develop a great gap between
two aspects of your mind and personality and within a very short time you'll become totally schizophrenic.

It is necessary to understand this point very well, because our religions, philosophies
and ways of thinking have not been very systematic, loving and tender in their approach
to the mind. We have always been led to believe that the mind is very mischievous, but
this is a grave mistake. Therefore, please try to redefine the mind and approach it
scientifically.

Mind is not a psychological stuff, nor is it a thought process. Mind is energy. Anger,
passion, greed, ambition, etc. are waves of that energy. Through kriya yoga you are
trying to harness the energies of the mind, but you should not try to suppress this energy
because it will explode. And the more you suppress this energy the greater will be the
ultimate explosion.

Kriya yoga is very clear in its approach to the mind. It emphasizes that you do not try
to do anything with the mind. If your body protests about maintaining a fixed posture,
change it. If your mind objects about closing the eyes, keep them open. But you must
continue with the kriya yoga practices because they have a direct effect on the deeper
processes of the body which are responsible for the state of your mind. Remember that the body affects the mind and the mind affects the body.

We should not consider the techniques of kriya yoga as practices of concentration or
meditation as their aim is not mental control. The beauty of kriya yoga is that you have
only to remain relaxed and let the mind move naturally and spontaneously. Inner
awareness will then awaken, and in time, your mind will automatically become one-
pointed.


### A path for all

As you know, we are all aspirants of a different caliber. Some of us are tamasic, some
are rajasic and a very small number are sattvic. Of course we are not purely sattvic,
rajasic or tamasic. Predominantly we are one of these, but we retain traces of the other
two gunas. The tamasic mind has traces of rajo guna, and as it evolves, it retains traces of
tamas, but it is now predominantly rajasic. It also develops traces of sattva. As it evolves
further, it becomes more rajasic and may or may not have traces of tamas and sattva.
Next, it becomes predominantly sattvic, with traces of rajo and tamo gunas here and
there. And then in its fifth stage of evolution, the mind becomes totally sattvic,
manifesting rajo and tamo gunas very rarely.

These five stages are like rungs on a ladder, representing the evolution of chitta or the
mind. The lowest rung is known as the inert mind. The second rung is the scattered mind,
the third is the oscillating mind, the fourth is the one-pointed mind and the fifth is the
controlled mind.

Now, if you belong to one of the first three categories, and most of us do, after
practising hatha yoga, you should take to kriya yoga. If you belong to one of the last two
categories, then after hatha yoga, you can take to kriya yoga if you want, or you can
follow the path of raja yoga or any other path which asks you to concentrate through
willpower. When you are at the sattvic level you can deal with the mind through the
mind, but when you are at the tamasic or rajasic level, if you try to deal with the mind
through the mind, you will cause a mental crisis.

In this world, there are very few sattvic people. Most of us have a very restless and
distracted mind, and we find it impossible to focus on one object or theme for very long.
You know what happens if you light a candle when the wind is blowing? The same thing
happens when most people try to concentrate. The fluctuations of the mind totally
annihilate the one-pointedness. So, the kriya yoga practices were designed for those
people who are unable to control, concentrate or stabilize their mind and for those who
cannot sit in one posture for a prolonged period of time.

Whether you are sattvic, rajasic or tamasic, the practices of hatha yoga should be
taken up first. A tamasic person needs hatha yoga to awaken his mind, body and
personality. A person who is rajasic needs hatha yoga to balance the solar and lunar
energies in his body and mind. And a person who is sattvic by temperament needs hatha
yoga to help him awaken kundalini. Hatha yoga is for everybody. And if you have been
practising asanas, pranayama, mudras and bandhas consistently for two years or more,
then you are ready for kriya yoga. Hatha yoga is the basis of kriya yoga.


## The practices

There are many kriya yoga practices, but a combination of 20 is considered very
important and powerful. These 20 practices are divided into two groups. One group is to
be done with the eyes open, that is the first 9, and the other group, comprised of 11
practices, is to be done with the eyes closed. For the first group of practices, the central
instruction is, 'Do not close your eyes.' Even though you feel very relaxed and have a
tendency to go within, you must not close your eyes. You can blink, you can rest, you can
stop the practices for a minute, but each practice must be done with the eyes open. This is
a very important instruction for kriya yoga practice.
The first practice in kriya yoga is called vipareeta karani mudra. Vipareeta means
reverse, karani means action, so vipareeta karani mudra is a method for creating a reverse
action. In Hatha Yoga Pradipika and in the tantric texts, there is a wonderful statement
regarding this reverse action:

"From the moon the nectar emanates. When the sun consumes the nectar, the yogi
becomes old. His body decays and he dies. Therefore, by constant practice, the yogi
should try to reverse the process. The nectar which is flowing from the moon (bindu
visarga) towards the sun (manipura chakra) should be reversed and sent back to the
higher centers." What will happen then? Hatha Yoga Pradipika continues: "When you
are able to reverse the flow of amrit or nectar, it will not be consumed by the sun. It will
be assimilated by your pure body."

When your body has been purified by hatha yoga, pranayama and a pure diet, this
nectar is assimilated by the body, and as a result of this, you experience a high mental
state. When the nectar returns to its source in the higher centers of the brain, and is not
consumed by the sun, you begin to feel a sort of calmness and quietness. Even if your
mind was distracted, confused, wandering and vacillating a few moments before,
suddenly all these activities come to an end and you feel total brightness. Your eyes are
open, you can hear sounds and see everything around you, but the mind does not move. It
appears as if time, space and object have ceased and the whole universe has stopped
functioning.

The main hypothesis or contention here, is that you can influence the structures of the
body; you can create a change in the energy forces. And by creating a change in the
physical secretions, by altering the chemical proportions and the energy proportions in
the body, you can create an effect on the mind which you may call shanti, dharana,
dhyana or samadhi. 

This means that even when your mind is totally undisciplined and
you cannot handle it for a second, if you are able to create the correct proportion of
secretions in the different areas of the body/mind, then the higher state can be achieved.
You know what happens if you take a dose of ganja (marijuana)? Take a few puffs
and see what happens to your mind. It slows down and the brain waves change from theta
to beta, from alpha to delta. Suddenly you feel calm and quiet. What happened to your
mind? You didn't fight with it. 

I'm not advocating the use of ganja, I'm just giving you a
very gross example of how kriya yoga works on your mind. By infusing ganja or some
hallucinogenic drug, the chemical properties of the gross body change. The heart slows
down, the breathing rate changes, the brain waves alter and the mind becomes calm and
still. Is it not possible to arrive at the same point through kriya yoga? Yes; this is exactly
what is accomplished through kriya yoga.

The various practices of kriya yoga, particularly vipareeta karani mudra, amrit pan,
khechari mudra, moola bandha, maha mudra, maha bheda mudra, etc. regulate the
nervous system. They harmonize the pranic forces in the body and equalize the quantity
and effects of the positive and negative ions. More than that, they help you to attain a
state of peace and tranquility without beating, kicking and abusing the mind. All this is a
result of having induced the flow of certain unused and natural chemicals of the body.
Amrit is one of those chemicals and through a practice known as khechari mudra, it can
be made to flow.


## Khechari mudra

Khechari mudra is a simple but very important technique which is utilized in most of
the kriya yoga practices. It involves folding the tongue back and placing it against the
upper palate. In the course of time the tongue gets elongated and can be inserted into the
nasal orifice. Then certain glands which are connected with the cranial passage and bindu
visarga are stimulated, and as a result, amrit or nectar begins to flow. When amrit is
released you experience a special type of'high' or intoxication.

It might take you a few years to perfect khechari mudra and to stimulate the flow of
amrit, but it is well worth the effort. When you sit for meditation the mind is perfectly
still, it cannot move and you cannot think. 

There is shoonyata, an experience of total
nothingness. If you are practising mantra you feel that somebody else is practising and
you are only witnessing it. This is considered a very important experience because it puts
you in touch with the external and internal experiences at the same time and you are
completely aware of yourself. You attain a state where you are simultaneously aware of
the world of mind, senses and objects, and the world of inner peace, tranquility and
relaxation. When there is perfect harmony in the nervous system, coronary behavior is in
inertia, body temperature is low and alpha waves are predominant in the brain, how can
the mind move? This is the philosophy of kriya yoga.


## Readiness for kriya yoga

If through the yoga practices you have been doing, you have reached a point where
you find that although concentration has been achieved, inner peace has been experienced
and you can maintain total quietness of body, mind and spirit for a prolonged period, but
still you feel there is something more to achieve, you are definitely ready for kriya yoga.
Peace of mind, relaxation and proper understanding, which are the fruits of spiritual
life, are not an end in themselves. The ultimate purpose of yoga is to change the quality
of experience and to change the quality of the mind and its perception. What man has
aimed to achieve through yoga is expansion of mind and liberation of energy, and in
essence, that is tantra, and that is the ultimate goal of kriya yoga.
