Sexual life has always been a problem for mankind. From the beginning of history,
the primal energy has been misunderstood. Religious teachers and moralists have
denounced it. But still sexual life has continued, not because man respects it, but because
he needs it. He may give it up, but he cannot remove it from his mind, for this is one of
his most powerful urges.

In the context of yoga and tantra the common definition of sexual life has no
relevance. It is absolutely unscientific and incorrect. This definition has created a society
and a nation of hypocrites. It has led thousands of young people into mental asylums.
When you want something which you think is bad, all kinds of guilt complexes arise.
This is the beginning of schizophrenia, and all of us are schizophrenic to some extent.
Therefore, the yogis have tried to give a correct direction to the sexual urge. Yoga
does not interfere with sexual life. Normal sexual life is neither spiritual nor aspiritual.
But if you practise yoga and master certain techniques, then sexual life becomes spiritual.
Of course, if you lead a celibate life, that is spiritual too.


### Left hand tantra

The science of tantra has two main branches, which are known as vama marga and
dakshina marga. Varna marga is the left path which combines sexual life with yoga
practices in order to explode the dormant energy centers. Dakshina marga is the right
path of yoga practices without sexual enactment. Previously, due to the barriers in sexual
life, the path most widely followed was dakshina marga. Today, however, these barriers
are rapidly being broken, and the path most sought after by the people everywhere is
vama marga, which utilizes sexual life for spiritual development.
According to tantra, sexual life has a threefold purpose. Some practise it for
procreation, others for pleasure, but the tantric yogi practises it for samadhi. He does not
hold any negative views about it. He does it as a part of his sadhana. But, at the same
time, he realizes that for spiritual purposes, the experience must be maintained.
Ordinarily this experience is lost before one is able to deepen it. By mastering certain
techniques, however, this experience can become continuous even throughout daily life.
Then the silent centers of the brain are awakened and they start to function all the time.


### The energy principle

The contention of vama marga is that the awakening of kundalini is possible through
the sexual interaction between man and woman. The concept behind this follows the
same lines as the process of fission and fusion described in modern physics.
Man and woman represent positive and negative energy. On a mental level they
represent time and space. Ordinarily, these two forces stand at opposite poles. During
sexual interaction, however, they move out of their position of polarity, towards the
center. When they come together at the nucleus or central point, an explosion occurs and
matter becomes manifest. This is the basic theme of tantric initiation.

The natural event that takes place between man and woman is considered as the
explosion of the energy center. In every speck of life, it is the union between the positive
and negative poles that is responsible for creation. At the same time, union between the
positive and negative poles is also responsible for enlightenment, and the experience
which takes place at the time of union is a glimpse of the higher experience.
This subject has been thoroughly discussed in all the old scriptures of tantra.

Actually, more important than the energy waves that are created during the mutual union,
is the process of directing that energy to the higher centers. Everybody knows how this
energy is to be created, but nobody knows how to direct it to the higher centers. In fact,
very few people have a full and positive understanding of this natural event which almost
everybody in this world experiences. If the conjugal experience, which is generally very
transitory, could be extended for a period of time, then the experience of enlightenment
would take place.

The elements that are brought together in this process of union are known as Shiva
and Shakti. Shiva represents purusha or consciousness and Shakti represents prakriti or
energy. Shakti, in different forms, is present in all creation. Both material and spiritual
energy are known as Shakti. When the energy moves outwardly, it is material energy and
when it is directed upwards it is spiritual energy. Therefore, when the union between man
and woman is practised in the correct way, it has a very positive influence on the
development of spiritual awareness.

### Retaining the bindu

Bindu means a point or a drop. In tantra, bindu is considered to be the nucleus, or the
abode of matter, the point from which all creation becomes manifest. Actually, the source
of bindu is in the higher centers of the brain. But due to the development of emotions and
passions, bindu falls down to the lower region where it is transformed into sperm and
ova. At the higher level, bindu is a point. At the lower level, it is drop of liquid, which
drips from the male and female orgasm.

According to tantra, preservation of the bindu is absolutely necessary for two reasons.

Firstly, the process of regeneration can only be carried out with the help of bindu.
Secondly, all the spiritual experiences take place when there is an explosion of bindu.
This explosion can result in the creation of a thought or of anything. Therefore, in tantra,
certain practices are recommended by which the male partner can stop ejaculation and
retain the bindu.

According to tantra, ejaculation should not take place. One should learn how to stop
it. For this purpose, the male partner should perfect the practices of vajroli mudra as well
as moola bandha and uddiyana bandha. When these three kriyas are perfected, one is able
to stop ejaculation completely at any point of the experience.

The sexual act culminates in a particular experience which is reached only at the point of explosion of energy. Unless the energy explodes, the experience cannot take place. But this experience has to be maintained, so that the energy level remains high. When the energy level falls ejaculation takes place. Therefore, ejaculation is avoided, not so much to preserve the semen, but because it causes a depression in the level of energy. To make this energy travel upwards through the spine, certain hatha yoga kriyas have to be mastered. The experience which is concomitant of energy has to be raised to the higher centers. It is only possible to do this if you are able to prolong and maintain that experience. As long as the experience continues, you can direct it to the higher centers. But as soon as the energy level undergoes depression, ejaculation will inevitably take place.

Ejaculation brings down the temperature of the body and at the same time, the nervous system undergoes depression. When the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems undergo depression, it affects the brain. That is why many people have mental problems. When you are able to retain the semen without ejaculating at all, the energy in the nervous system and the temperature in the whole body are maintained. At the same time, you are free from the sense of loss, depression , frustration and guilt. Retention will also help to increase the sexual frequency, and that is better for both partners. The sexual act does not have to create weakness or dissipate the energy, on the contrary, it can become a means of exploding the energy. Therefore, the value of retaining the bindu should not be underestimated.

In hatha yoga there are certain practices which must be perfected for this purpose. You should begin with asanas such as paschimottanasana, shalabhasana, vajrasana, supta vajrasana and siddhasana. These are beneficial as they place an automatic contraction on the lower centers. Sirshasana is also important because it ventilates the brain so that all of one's experiences will be healthy experiences. When these postures have been mastered, shambhavi mudra is perfected in order to hold the concentration steadily at bhrumadhya. Then vajroli mudra has to be practised together with moola bandha and uddiyana bandha in kumbhaka. Practice of kumbhaka is necessary while the ejaculation is being held. Retention of the breath and the bindu go hand in hand. Loss of kumbhaka is loss of bindu, and loss of bindu is loss of kumbhaka.

During kumbhaka, when you are maintaining the experience, you should be able to direct it to the higher centers. If you are able to create an archetype of this experience, perhaps in the form of a serpent or a luminous continuity, then the result will be fantastic. So, in spiritual life, bindu must be preserved at all costs.
