### Month 1

Direct concentration on ajna chakra is very difficult, and for this reason, in tantra
and yoga the mid-eyebrow center (which in fact is the kshetram of ajna), is used to
awaken this chakra. This point is called bhrumadhya ('bhru' means eyebrow and 'madhya'
means center), and it lies between the two eyebrows in the place where Indian ladies put
a red dot and pandits and brahmins put a mark of sandal paste. This eyebrow center can
be contacted by various techniques.

Firstly, there is an important shatkriya (cleansing technique) called trataka, which will
aid in the awakening of ajna. It is a powerful technique which can be denned as 'fixed
gazing at one point'. If practised regularly, it develops the power of concentration, and
from this concentration, the direct awakening of the latent faculties of ajna chakra is
brought about.

Ajna can also be contacted by concentrating on the nadis directly. The method for this
is anuloma viloma pranayama, which is known in English as 'the coming and going
pranayama'.

You can also awaken ajna chakra by concentrating on the eyebrow center, by such
practices as shambhavi mudra. Initially, when there is no sensation or awareness at this
point, some ointment or oil such as tiger balm can be applied. This facilitates
concentration. With practice, the pressure of concentration at this area increases and the
sensations are carried back to the pineal gland. This brings about an awakening there in
the form of visions and internal experiences.
Ajna and mooladhara chakras are closely related, and the awakening of one helps to
awaken the other. Ideally, ajna should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in
order to allow an unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and the
lower chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to further awaken ajna.
In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is through the practices of moola
bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific for mooladhara.


## Preparatory practices

Jala and sutra neti can be practised for a few months to purify the nasal area. This
will help to sensitize ajna chakra and aid in its awakening. Apart from having a profound
effect on the nervous system, neti removes dirt and mucus from the nasal passages,
relieving colds and sinusitis, disorders of the eyes, ears, nose and throat, as well as
inflammation of the tonsils, adenoids and mucus membranes. It removes drowsiness and
gives a genera] lightness and freshness in the head and throughout the body. At the same
time, it profoundly alters psychic awareness, facilitating free flow of breath in both
nostrils, so that the meditative state can be attained. It should be practised every morning
before you commence your other sadhana. For complete details refer to the Bihar School
of Yoga publication Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha.\


### Practice 1: Anuloma viloma pranayama (the coming and going breath)

Sit in a comfortable meditative posture. Make sure the spine is erect and the body is
relaxed. The body must become absolutely still. After some minutes, begin to develop
awareness of the breath in the nostrils. When you breathe in, your whole awareness
should flow with the breath from the tip of the nose, through the nasal passages, up to the
eyebrow center. And when you breathe out, your whole awareness should flow with the
breath from the eyebrow center to the tip of the nose.

Become aware of the triangular form of the breath between the nostrils and the
eyebrow center. The base of the triangle is at the level of the upper lip, its sides are the
right and left nasal passages, and its apex is within the eyebrow center. Firstly, feel the
breath moving in and out of the left nostril, then the right nostril. Then be aware of the
breath as it flows in and out through both nostrils together.

Once you are established in this breath awareness, begin to consciously alternate the
flow of the breath between the two nostrils in the same way as nadi shodhana, except you
practise it psychically. Consciously inhale through the left nostril to bhru-madhya and
exhale through the right, then inhale through the right txTbhrumadhya, and exhale
through the left. This is one round-After completing four such rounds, inhale and exhale
through both nostrils simultaneously, visualizing the passage of the breath forming an
inverted V-shape. In this way you have to continue - four alternate nostril breaths, then
one breath through both nostrils. Count the rounds from 100 back to zero.

100 - inhale left nostril, exhale right nostril; inhale right nostril, exhale left nostril, 99 -
repeat, 98- repeat, 97- repeat, 96- inhale both nostrils, exhale both nostrils, and so on.
Note: Accuracy in the counting is absolutely necessary, and if an error is made, the
practice must recommence from 100. It is very important to keep count of the breaths,
because without keeping count, aiiuloma viloma is altogether too powerful for many
aspirants, swallowing up their awareness in the unconscious sphere- The aim of the
practice is to stimulate ajna chakra on the subconscious, psychic level, and for this,
awareness must be maintained.

If you sink into the unconscious sphere, you will only be aware of the vast store of
impressions in the unconscious mind, and will completely lose awareness of the practice.
This awareness is essential for the development of mind control and the awakening of
ajna chakra to conscious accessibility.

This practice can also be very well integrated into yoga nidra. (See practice chapter 2)


## Practice 2: Trataka

Fixed gazing on one point

Sit in a comfortable meditative asana, in a dark room in which there is no draught or
breeze.

Place a lighted candle at eye level, directly in front of the eyebrow center, at a
distance of approximately two feet.
Make sure that the wick is perfectly straight and that the flame is motionless.
Straighten the spine, close the eyes and relax the body.
Be aware of the physical body only. Let it become as still as a statue. From this time
on you should try to keep the body absolutely motionless throughout the whole practice.
When you are prepared, open your eyes and gaze intently at the brightest part of the
flame - just above the tip of the wick.
With practice you should be able to gaze at the flame for a few minutes, without
blinking or moving the eyeballs.
Continue to gaze at the flame with total concentration. The whole of your
consciousness must become centered in the flame, to the extent that awareness of the rest
of the body and the room is lost.

The gaze should be absolutely fixed on one point.

When the eyes become tired (perhaps after a few minutes), or if they begin to water,
close them and relax.

Do not move the body, but be aware of the after-image of the flame in front of the
closed eyes.

Everyone has looked into the sun or a bright light, and on closing the eyes for a few
minutes, has seen the clear impression of that light on the retina of the eye. Likewise, the
after-image of the candle flame will be clearly visible.
You should practise trataka on this image, holding it directly in front or a little above
the eyebrow center-As soon as it begins to fade, open the eyes again and continue to
concentrate on the external candle flame.

Note: The best times to practise trataka are the dark hours of the very early morning
or late at night. At these times, the atmosphere becomes very still and quiet - not only the
physical atmosphere, but the mental and psychic atmospheres also. In this stillness,
success in trataka is readily attained.


### Other forms of trataka

Trataka can be practised on a small dot, the full moon, a shadow, a crystal ball, the
nosetip, an image in water, a yantra, darkness, a shivalingam and many other things.
Those who have a personal deity can practise trataka on his or her form and those who
have a guru can practise on his or her photograph. Trataka can also be practised on the
rising sun, one's own image in the mirror, or the eyes of another person. These should,
however, be done under the guidance of a guru, as there are certain risks involved.

There are two divisions of trataka, bahiranga (outer) and antaranga (inner). The
methods mentioned so far are all part of bahiranga trataka. Inner trataka (antaranga) is
internal visualization, perhaps of a chakra, a yantra or your personal deity. The eyes
remain closed throughout. One of the best inner objects for concentration is a tiny star or
point of light.

Duration: Trataka can be practised as time permits, but 15 to 20 minutes is the usual
period in the beginning.

Benefits: Trataka has many physical, mental and spiritual benefits. Physically, it
corrects eye weaknesses and certain defects such as nearsightedness. Mentally, it
increases nervous stability, removes insomnia and relaxes the anxious mind. When the
eyes are fixed and unmoving, the mind becomes the same. The thinking process
automatically ceases as concentration increases. It brings control to the tempestuous
rnind, and spiritually it awakens ajna chakra.

Practice 3: Shambhavi mudra with Om chanting

Eyebrow center gazing

### Stage 1

Sit in any meditative pose with the back straight and hands on the knees. Look
forward at a fixed point, and then look upward as high as possible without moving the
head. Focus the eyes and concentrate on the eyebrow center. Try to suspend the thought
processes and meditate on ajna chakra.
Repeat Om, Om, Om, with awareness of the sound vibrations at the eyebrow center
into which you are gazing. Each Оm should be produced in a soft clear voice, with
awareness of every vibration of the mantra in the eyebrow center. Each mantra should be
one or two seconds in duration, and immediately followed by the next. Practise for 3 to 5
minutes.

### Stage 2

The eyes are closed, but the inner gaze remains in the eyebrow center.Begin to
chant the mantra more slowly, with full awareness of the sound vibration in the eyebrow
center. Imagine that the sound is being emitted from within the eyebrow center itself.
Gradually and effortlessly increase the duration of each Om, making it long and
continuous. The sound should be steady and of an even key, ending on completion of the
breath. Then refill the lungs completely by breathing through the nose, but do not alter
the position of the body or head. Begin the next Om, maintaining awareness of the sound
emerging from the eyebrow center. Practise for 5 minutes.

### Stage 3

Continue to chant the mantra Оm, but become aware of the sound reverberating
throughout the body. Try to be aware of the sound only, listening to its vibration
emerging from the eyebrow center and permeating the whole body. Do not be self-
conscious, but allow the sound to manifest itself fully, maintaining awareness of the
vibration of the sound only. Practise for 5 minutes. Gradually the duration of the practice
can be lengthened.
Caution: Do not strain the eye muscles; when they become tired or slightly strained,
release shambhavi mudra.

## Practise

This sadhana (consisting of practices 1, 2 and 3), for ajna chakra, should be continued
daily for one month. Then proceed to the sadhana for awakening mooladhara chakra.
