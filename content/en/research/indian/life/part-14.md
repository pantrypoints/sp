Contact with the Brahmos increased Sri Ramakrishna's longing to encounter devotees who would be able to follow his teachings in their purest form. 

"There was no limit", he once declared, "to the longing I felt at that time. During the day-time I somehow
managed to control it. The secular talk of the worldly-minded was galling to me, and I
would look wistfully to the day when my own beloved companions would come. 

I hoped to find solace in conversing with them and relating to them my own realizations. Every little incident would remind me of them, and thoughts of them wholly engrossed me. I was already arranging in my mind what I should say to one and give to another, and so on.

But when the day would come to a close I would not be able to curb my feelings. The thought that another day had gone by, and they had not come, oppressed me. When, during the evening service, the temples rang with the sound of bells and conch-shells, I would climb to the roof of the Kuthi in the garden and, writhing in anguish of heart, cry
at the top of my voice: 'Come, my children! Oh, where are you? I cannot bear to live
without you.' A mother never longed so intensely for the sight of her child, nor a friend
for his companions, nor a lover for his sweetheart, as I longed for them. Oh, it was
indescribable! Shortly after this period of yearning the devotees began to come."

In 1879, occasional writings about Sri Ramakrishna by the Brahmos, in the Brāhmo magazines, began to attract his future disciples from the educated middle-class Bengālis, and they continued to come till 1884.

But others, too, came, feeling the subtle power of his attraction. They were an ever shifting crowd of people of all castes and creeds:

- Hindus and Brahmos
- Vaishnavas and Śāktās
- the educated with university degrees and the illiterate
- old and young
- maharajas and beggars
- journalists and artists,
- pundits and devotees
- philosophers and the worldly-minded
- jnānis and yogis
- men of action and men of faith
- virtuous women and prostitutes
- office-holders and vagabonds,
- philanthropists and self-seekers
- dramatists and drunkards
- builders-up and pullers-down.

He gave to them all, without stint, from his illimitable store of realization. No one went away empty-handed. He taught them the lofty knowledge of the Vedānta and the soul-melting love of the Purānā. 

Twenty hours out of twenty-four he would speak without rest or respite. He gave to all his sympathy and enlightenment, and he touched them with that strange power of the soul which could not but melt even the most
hardened. 

People understood him according to their powers of comprehension.

## The Master's Method of Teaching

But he remained as ever the willing instrument in the hand of God, the child of the Divine Mother, totally untouched by the idea of being a teacher. He used to say that three ideas - that he was a guru, a father, and a master - pricked his flesh like thorns. 

Yet he was an extraordinary teacher. He stirred his disciples' hearts more by a subtle influence than by actions or words. He never claimed to be the founder of a religion or the organizer of a sect. Yet he was a religious dynamo. He was the verifier of all religions and creeds.

He was like an expert gardener, who prepares the soil and removes the weeds, knowing that the plants will grow because of the inherent power of the seeds, producing each its appropriate flowers and fruits. He never thrust his ideas on anybody.
He understood people's limitations and worked on the principle that what is good for one
may be bad for another. 

He had the unusual power of knowing the devotees' minds, even their inmost souls, at the first sight. He accepted disciples with the full knowledge of their past tendencies and future possibilities. The life of evil did not frighten him, nor did religious squeamishness raise anybody in his estimation. He saw in everything the unerring finger of the Divine Mother. Even the light that leads astray was to him the light from God.

To those who became his intimate disciples the Master was a friend, companion, and playmate. Even the chores of religious discipline would be lightened in his presence. 

The devotees would be so inebriated with pure joy in his company that they would have no time to ask themselves whether he was an Incarnation, a perfect soul, or a yogi. His very presence was a great teaching; words were superfluous. In later years his disciples remarked that while they were with him they would regard him as a comrade, but afterwards would tremble to think of their frivolities in the presence of such a great person.

They had convincing proof that the Master could, by his mere wish, kindle in their hearts the love of God and give them His vision. 

Through all this fun and frolic, this merriment and frivolity, he always kept before them the shining ideal of God-Consciousness and the path of renunciation. He prescribed ascents steep or graded according to the powers of the climber. He permitted no compromise with the basic principles of purity. An aspirant had to keep his body, mind,
senses, and soul unspotted; had to have a sincere love for God and an ever mounting
spirit of yearning. 

The rest would be done by the Mother.

His disciples were of two kinds: the householders, and the young men, some of whom were later to become monks. There was also a small group of women devotees. 

## House Holder Devotees

For the householders Sri Ramakrishna did not prescribe the hard path of total renunciation. He wanted them to discharge their obligations to their families. Their renunciation was to be mental. Spiritual life could not he acquired by flying away from
responsibilities. 

A married couple should live like brother and sister after the birth of one or two children, devoting their time to spiritual talk and contemplation. He encouraged the householders, saying that their life was, in a way, easier than that of the monk,
since it was more advantageous to fight the enemy from inside a fortress than in an
open field.

He insisted, however, on their repairing into solitude every now and then to strengthen their devotion and faith in God through prayer, japa, and meditation. He prescribed for them the companionship of sādhus . He asked them to perform their
worldly duties with one hand, while holding to God with the other, and to pray to God to
make their duties fewer and fewer so that in the end they might cling to Him with both
hands. 

He would discourage in both the householders and the celibate youths any lukewarmness in their spiritual struggles. He would not ask them to follow indiscriminately the ideal of non-resistance, which ultimately makes a coward of the unwary.
