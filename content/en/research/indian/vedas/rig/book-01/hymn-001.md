## Hymn 1

<sup>1</sup> I praise Agni, the chosen Priest, God, minister of sacrifice. The inovker and bestower of wealth.

<sup>2</sup> Agni is honored by ancient and modern sages. He brings the gods here to the ritual.

<sup>3</sup> Through Agni man obtains wealth and prosperity day by day, most rich in heroic offspring.

<sup>4</sup> Agni, the perfect sacrifice which you encompasses about Verily goes to the Gods.

<sup>5</sup> May Agni, sapient-minded Priest, truthful, most gloriously great, The God, come hither with the Gods.

<sup>6</sup> Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper,
   That, Angiras, is indeed thy truth.

<sup>7</sup> To thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with prayer
   Bringing thee reverence, we come

8. Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One,
   Increasing in thine own abode.

9. Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son:
   Agni, be with us for our weal.

     Drink of them, hearken to our call.

     So come ye swiftly hitherward.
6. Vayu and Indra, come to what the Soma. presser hath prepared:
     Soon, Heroes, thus I make my prayer.

     Accept the sacrificial food.
2 Ye Asvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise,
     Accept our songs with mighty thought.
3 Nasatyas, wonder-workers, yours are these libations with clipt grass:
     Come ye whose paths are red with flame.
4 O Indra marvellously bright, come, these libations long for thee,
     Thus by fine fingers purified.
5 Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the prayers,
     Of the libation-pouring priest.
6 Approach, O Indra, hasting thee, Lord of Bay Horses, to the prayers.
     In our libation take delight.
7 Ye Visvedevas, who protect, reward, and cherish men, approach
     Your worshipper's drink-offering.
8 Ye Visvedevas, swift at work, come hither quickly to the draught,
     As milch-kine hasten to their stalls.
