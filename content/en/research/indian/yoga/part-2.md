<sup>1</sup> Yoga has 3 components:

1. Discipline
2. Self-study
3. Faith in the Supreme (Isvara)

<!-- Orientation toward the ideal of pure awareness -->

<sup>2</sup> The aim of Yoga is to eliminate suffering and attain samadhi. 


<!-- 2.1 Austerity, the study of sacred texts, and the dedication of action to God constitute the discipline of Mystic Union. -->

<sup>3</sup> The causes of suffering are:

1. Ignorance
2. Ego
3. Desires
4. Aversion
5. Self-preservation


<sup>4</sup> Ignorance is the starting place for for all the other causes of suffering, whether they are dormant or active, or noticed or unnoticed.

 <!-- partially overcome or fully operative. -->

<!-- 2.2 This discipline is practised for the purpose of acquiring fixity of mind on the Lord, free from all impurities and agitations, or on One's Own Reality, and for attenuating the afflictions.

2.3 The five afflictions are ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and the desire to cling to life. -->

<!-- 2.4 Ignorance is the breeding place  -->


<sup>5</sup> Ignorance causes one to think that:
- the impermanent is permanent
- the impure is pure
- what causes suffering is what causes happiness*
- what is not your nature is your nature

 <!-- is eternal, the impure for the pure, evil for good and non-self as self. -->


{{< n n="Examples are intoxicants and attachments that seem to make us happy but are actually causing suffering" >}}


<!-- Lacking this wisdom, one mistakes that which is impermanent, impure, distressing, or empty of self
for permanence, purity, happiness, and self. -->


<sup>6</sup> The ego assigns the power of awareness to the self.

  <!-- is the identification of the power that knows with the instruments of knowing. -->

<sup>7</sup> The ego then pursues desires for pleasure <sup>8</sup> and avoids suffering.

<!-- Desires Attachment Attachment is that magnetic pattern which clusters in pleasure and pulls one towards such experience. -->

<!-- 2.8 Aversion is the magnetic pattern which clusters in misery and pushes one from such experience. -->

<sup>9</sup> The ego then, even of a wise person, seeks to preserve itself.

<!-- 2.9 Flowing by its own energy, established even in the wise and in the foolish, is the unending desire for life. -->

<sup>10</sup> These causes of suffering can be removed by seeing subtly where they come from and reversing course.

<!--  a

2.10 These patterns when subtle may be removed by developing their contraries. -->

<sup>11</sup> Intense meditation destroys their patterns. 

<!-- 2.11 Their active afflictions are to be destroyed by meditation. -->

<sup>12</sup> These causes result in actions which pile up unseen impressions in the soul which are expressed in future lives. 

<sup>13</sup> So long as this root source exists, its contents will lead to birth, life, and experience.


<!-- 2.12 The impressions of works have their roots in afflictions and arise as experience in the present and the future births. -->

<!-- 2.13 When the root exists, its fruition is birth, life and experience. -->

<sup>14</sup> Life is then marked by delight or anguish, in proportion to those good or bad actions that created the piled-up impressions (samskaras).

<sup>15</sup> The wise see the suffering caused by:
- the anguish of impermanence
- the variety of samskaras
- the beligerence of the propensities (of the sentient, mutative, and tamasic)
<!-- The  these samskaras cause suffering.  -->

<!-- 2.14 They have pleasure or pain as their fruit, according as their cause be virtue or vice. -->

<!-- 2.15 All is misery to the wise because of the pains of change, anxiety, and purificatory acts. -->


<sup>16</sup> But the suffering which has not yet come may be avoided.

<sup>17</sup> The cause of the suffering can be overcome by discerning the events in the phenomenal world. 

<!--   What awareness regards, namely the phenomenal world, embodies the qualities of luminosity,
activity, and inertia; it includes oneself, composed of both elements and the senses; and, it is the
ground for both sensual experience and liberation. -->

<sup>18</sup> This discernment will make one realize that the patterns of activity, rest, and knowledge in the phenomenal world, making it both the source for experience and for liberation. <sup>19</sup> It reveals the distinction between the gunas (sentient, mutative, static). 

<sup>20</sup> This discernment makes consciousness a witessing entity through the mind that perceives the phenomenal world. 

<sup>21</sup> The phenomenal world exists to reveal the true nature to consciousness.

<sup>22</sup> Once the true nature is revealed, the phenomenal world no longer appears as such. It continues to exist as a common reality for everyone else.

<sup>23</sup> The phenomenal world has the power to take on many forms. 

<!-- Creation and consciousness 
own owner power acquisition of own forms in yoga -->

<sup>24</sup> This is the cause of Ignorance (or the Illusion).

 <!-- is the cause of this phenomenal world.  -->

<sup>25</sup> Yoga ends the ignorance, revealing that awareness is free and untouched by phenomena.

<!-- 2.17 The cause of the avoidable is the superimposition of the external world onto the unseen world. -->

<!-- 2.18 The experienced world consists of the elements and the senses in play. It is of the nature of cognition, activity and rest, and is for the purpose of experience and realization. -->

<!-- 2.19 The stages of the attributes effecting the experienced world are the specialized and the unspecialized, the differentiated and the undifferentiated.

2.20 The indweller is pure consciousness only, which though pure, sees through the mind and is identified by ego as being only the mind. -->

<!-- 2.21 The very existence of the seen is for the sake of the seer. -->

<!-- 2.22 Although Creation is discerned as not real for the one who has achieved the goal, it is yet real in that Creation remains the common experience to others. -->

<sup>26</sup>  Continuous discernment is the means for attaining liberation.

<!-- 2.23 The association of the seer with Creation is for the distinct recognition of the objective world, as well as for the recognition of the distinct nature of the seer.

2.24 The cause of the association is ignorance.

2.25 Liberation of the seer is the result of the dissassociation of the seer and the seen, with the disappearance of ignorance. -->

<!-- 2.26 The continuous practice of discrimination  -->

<sup>27</sup> True wisdom manifests in seven stages.

<sup>28</sup> When the limbs of yoga are practiced:
- impurities dwindle
- the light of understanding shines forth, illuminating the way to discernment


<sup>29</sup> The eight limbs of yoga are:

1. Yama (External Rules)
2. Niyama (Internal Rules)
3. Asanas (Yoga Poses)
4. Pranayama (Breath Regulation)
5. Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal)
6. Dharana (Focus or Concentration)
7. Dhyana (Intense Meditation)
8. Samadhi

<!-- concentration, meditative absorption, and integration. -->

<sup>30</sup> Yama is made up of:

1. Ahimsa (Non-harming)
2. Satya (Truthfulnes)
3. Asteya (Non-stealing)
4. Brahmacarya (Seeing all as the Supreme)
5. Aparigraha (Focus on Needs, not Wants)

{{< n n="These 5 are for the 5 Layers: Ahimsa is for Matter, Brahmacarya is for Convertible, Aparigraha is for Radiance, Asteya is for Spacetime, Satya is for Aether" >}}


<sup>31</sup> The yogi has a great vow to observe these at all levels regardless of time, place, circumstance, or position in life.


<sup>32</sup> Niyama is made up of:

1. Shaoca (Purity)
2. Santosa (Contentment)
3. Tapah (Austerity)
4. Svadhyaya (Self-Study)
5. Isvara Pranidhana (Surrender to Supreme)


{{< n n="These 5 are for the 5 Layers: Shaoca is for Matter, Santosa is for Convertible, Tapah is for Radiance, Svadhyaya is for Spacetime, Isvara Pranidhana is for Aether" >}}
 

<!-- 2.28 On the destruction of impurity by the sustained practice of the limbs of Union, the light of knowledge reveals the faculty of discrimination. -->

<!-- 2.29 The eight limbs of Union are self-restraint in actions, fixed observance, posture, regulation of energy, mind-control in sense engagements, concentration, meditation, and realization. -->

<!-- 2.30 Self-restraint in actions includes abstention from violence, from falsehoods, from stealing, from sexual engagements, and from acceptance of gifts. -->


<sup>33</sup> Unwholesome thoughts can be neutralized by cultivating wholesome ones.

<sup>34</sup> Improper thoughts and emotions such as those of violence- whether done, caused to be done, or even approved of- indeed, any thought originating in desire, anger or delusion, whether mild medium or intense- do all result in endless pain and misery. Overcome such distractions by pondering on the opposites.

<sup>35</sup> Being firmly grounded in **non-violence** creates an atmosphere in which others can let go of their hostility.

<sup>36</sup> For those grounded in **truthfulness**, every action and its consequences are imbued with truth.

<sup>37</sup> For those who have **no inclination to steal**, the truly precious is at hand.

<sup>38</sup> Those who **see the Supreme in all** acquire vitality.

<sup>39</sup> **Freedom from wanting** unlocks the real purpose of existence.

<sup>40</sup> From purity follows a withdrawal from enchantment over one's own body as well as a cessation of desire for physical contact with others.

<sup>41</sup> **Purification** leads to a one-pointed sense leading to happiness, mastery of the soul, and ability for vision.
 <!-- self-awareness -->

<sup>42</sup> **Contentment** brings unsurpassed joy.

<sup>43</sup> **Auserity** burns away impurities, increasing the powers of the senses. 

<sup>44</sup> **Spiritual self-study** brings one closer to one’s divine goals. 

 <!-- personal deity. -->

<sup>45</sup> **Surrendering to the Supreme** gives powers to reach samadhi. 

<sup>46</sup> **Asanas** bring steady happiness. <sup>47</sup> These relax the body, allowing a deeper meditation  <sup>48</sup> so that one is no longer disturbed by the play of opposites.

<sup>49</sup> With this deep meditation, the flow of inhalation and exhalation, as pranayama, can further end the play of opposites.  

<sup>50</sup> This leads to a breathing pattern of inhalation, exhalation, and lull. When done in a specific duration, number, and focus, the breath becomes subtle. <sup>51-52</sup> This makes the external and internal world give way to the fourth world of light that removes the veil <sup>53</sup> so that the mind's capacity for focus in attained. 

<sup>54</sup> **Pratyahara** is the decoupling of the senses from external objects. This is achieved when the mind itself decouples from the external world. <sup>55</sup> Then, the senses serve only the Supreme.



<!-- perfecting  the body and its senses become supremely refined. -->

<!-- With bodily purification, one’s body ceases to be compelling, likewise contact with others. -->

<!-- 2.31 These five willing abstentions are not limited by rank, place, time or circumstance and constitute the Great Vow.

2.32 The fixed observances are cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study and persevering devotion to God.

2.33 When improper thoughts disturb the mind, there should be constant pondering over the opposites.

2.34 

2.35 When one is confirmed in non-violence, hostility ceases in his presence.

2.36 When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him.

2.37 All jewels approach him who is confirmed in honesty.

2.38 When one is confirmed in celibacy, spiritual vigor is gained.

2.39 When one is confirmed in non-possessiveness, the knowledge of the why and how of existence is attained.

2.40 From purity follows a withdrawal from enchantment over one's own body as well as a cessation of desire for physical contact with others.

2.41 As a result of contentment there is purity of mind, one-pointedness, control of the senses, and fitness for the vision of the self.

2.42 Supreme happiness is gained via contentment.

2.43 Through sanctification and the removal of impurities, there arise special powers in the body and senses.

2.44 By study comes communion with the Lord in the Form most admired.

2.45 Realization is experienced by making the Lord the motive of all actions.

2.46 The posture should be steady and comfortable.

2.47 In effortless relaxation, dwell mentally on the Endless with utter attention.

2.48 From that there is no disturbance from the dualities.

2.49 When that exists, control of incoming and outgoing energies is next.

2.50 It may be external, internal, or midway, regulated by time, place, or number, and of brief or long duration.

2.51 Energy-control which goes beyond the sphere of external and internal is the fourth level- the vital.

2.52 In this way, that which covers the light is destroyed.

2.53 Thus the mind becomes fit for concentration.

2.54 When the mind maintains awareness, yet does not mingle with the senses, nor the senses with sense impressions, then self-awareness blossoms.

2.55 In this way comes mastery over the senses. -->
