<sup>1</sup> Such powers can be attained:
- from birth
- through herbs
- mantra repetition
- renunciation
<!-- extreme  -->

<!-- 4.1 Psychic powers arise by birth, drugs, incantations, purificatory acts or concentrated insight. -->

<sup>2</sup> These powers allow the transformation of static Prakrti when it overflows. <sup>3</sup> This is similar to a farmer who diverts a wild stream for use in irrigation. In this way, the cause and effects of the phenomenal world are better controlled.

<!-- 4.2 Transformation into another state is by the directed flow of creative nature. -->


 

<!--  Static Prakrti

4.3 Creative nature is not moved into action by any incidental cause, but by the removal of obstacles, as in the case of a farmer clearing his field of stones for irrigation. -->


### Ego and Samskaras

<sup>4</sup> The creation of ego leads to the creation of mind. <sup>5</sup> In this way, one consciousness becomes many egos, leading to a vast array of distinctive perceptions.

<!-- 4.4 Created minds arise from egoism alone. -->

<sup>6</sup> But when that consciousness is always fixed in dhyana, it is not affected by samskaras. <sup>7</sup> In this way, the actions of a realized yogi do not bring good or evil karma, whereas the actions of others may bring good, evil, or neutral karma.

<sup>8</sup> The karma of actions come from those samskaras depending on the qualities of those samskaras. <sup>9</sup> The memory of the samskaras stretches uninterruptedly across the demarcations of birth, place, and time.  
<!-- From them proceed the development of the tendencies which bring about the fruition of actions. -->

<!-- Because the depth memory and its latent impressions are of a piece, their dynamic of cause and effect flows  -->

<sup>10</sup> Action-samskara-reaction have always existed, because the will to exist is eternal. <sup>11</sup> Since its cause, effect, basis, and object are inseparable, a samskara disappears when all of them disappear.

<sup>12</sup> The past and future are immanent possibilities in a soul, taking diverse paths according to that soul's dharma.

<!-- existing as different sectors in the same flow of experiential substances. -->

<sup>13</sup> These possibilities manifest according to the gunas [tamasic, rajasic, sattvic] that influence the soul. <sup>14</sup> This transforms the seeming oneness of an object's inherent qualities.

 

 <!-- shifts create a single reality made up of different Elements.  -->

 <!-- unifies  -->

<!-- transformations  The layers of reality 

transformations of the gunas tend to blur together, imbuing each new object of action with a quality of substantiality. -->

<sup>15</sup> This is why people perceive the same object differently, as each person’s perception follows a separate path from another’s. <sup>16</sup> But the object itself is not dependent on any of those perceptions. If it were dependent, then what would happen to it when nobody was looking?

<sup>17</sup> It is mind that applies its colors onto an object, for it to perceive that object. Otherwise, the object cannot be known. <sup>18</sup> The various changing colors of minds are always known by Pure Consciousness which is their ultimate, unchanging witness.

<sup>19</sup> It is Pure Consciousness that gives light to see those other minds. <sup>20</sup> This is because Pure Consciousness cannot see Itself.

 <!-- Furthermore, consciousness and its object cannot be perceived at once. -->

<sup>21</sup> If Pure Consciousness could see Itself, then the chain of such perceptions would regress infinitely, imploding memory. <sup>22</sup> This is why Pure Consciousness takes the form of different minds, to reflect itself as it perceives Itself through Its unchanging self-perception.

 <!-- Once consciousness is stilled, it reflects the unchanging pure awareness, and can  -->

<sup>23</sup> Then, It sees all the colors painted by minds, fulfilling Its purposes. 

<!--  can be colored by both pure awareness and the phenomenal world, thereby
fulfilling all its purposes. -->


### The Path to Freedom

<sup>24</sup> Minds are colored by countless latent traits for another purpose -- to gain freedom.  <sup>25</sup> This other purpose is discovered by someone who realizes that the soul can end the activities of the mind.

<!-- , like all compound phenomena, has another purpose - to serve awareness. -->

<!-- As soon as one can distinguish between consciousness and awareness, the ongoing construction of the self ceases. -->

<sup>26</sup> The mind, who has gained this realization, can gravitate toward freeing and unburdening his mind.

 <!-- - the fully integrated knowledge that pure awareness is independent from nature. -->

<sup>27</sup> It realizes that freedom is prevented by the perceptions from the samskaras. <sup>28</sup> These distractions can be subdued in the same way the causes of suffering are subdued, as explained earlier.

<!-- Any gaps in discriminating awareness allow distracting thoughts to emerge from samskaras. -->

<!-- were, by tracing them back to their origin, or through meditative absorption. -->

<sup>29</sup> The highest state is achieved when one sees phenomena without any attachments and sees the dharma through samadhi. <sup>30</sup> This realization extinguishes both the causes of suffering and the cycle of cause and effect.

<sup>31</sup> Once all the layers and imperfections concealing truth have been washed away, insight is boundless, with little left to know. <sup>32</sup> Then the seamless flow of reality, as well as the gunas, begins to break down, fulfilling the true mission of consciousness.

<sup>33</sup> One can then see that reality is made up of individual moments that transform into the other in a flow.

<!--  the flow is actually a series of discrete events, each corresponding to the merest
instant of time, in which one form becomes another. -->

<sup>34</sup> Pure consciousness, with the gunas eliminated, reverses the flow of bondage and gets the freedom and power to see its own true form.


<!-- Freedom is at hand when the fundamental qualities of nature, each of their transformations witnessed at the moment of its inception, are recognized as irrelevant to pure awareness; it stands alone, grounded in its very nature, 

the power to see its own  

of pure seeing. -->


<!-- 4.5 There being difference of interest, one mind is the director of many minds. -->

<!-- 4.6 Of these, the mind born of concentrated insight is free from the impressions. -->

<!-- 4.7 The impressions of unitive cognition are neither good nor bad. In the case of the others, there are three kinds of impressions. -->

<!-- 4.8 From them proceed the development of the tendencies which bring about the fruition of actions.

4.9 Because of the magnetic qualities of habitual mental patterns and memory, a relationship of cause and effect clings even though there may be a change of embodiment by class, space and time.

4.10 The desire to live is eternal, and the thought-clusters prompting a sense of identity are beginningless.

4.11 Being held together by cause and effect, substratum and object- the tendencies themselves disappear on the dissolution of these bases.

4.12 The past and the future exist in the object itself as form and expression, there being difference in the conditions of the properties.

4.13 Whether manifested or unmanifested they are of the nature of the attributes.

4.14 Things assume reality because of the unity maintained within that modification.

4.15 Even though the external object is the same, there is a difference of cognition in regard to the object because of the difference in mentality.

4.16 And if an object known only to a single mind were not cognized by that mind, would it then exist?

4.17 An object is known or not known by the mind, depending on whether or not the mind is colored by the object.

4.18 The mutations of awareness are always known on account of the changelessness of its Lord, the indweller.

4.19 Nor is the mind self-luminous, as it can be known.

4.20 It is not possible for the mind to be both the perceived and the perceiver simultaneously.

4.21 In the case of cognition of one mind by another, we would have to assume cognition of cognition, and there would be confusion of memories.

4.22 Consciousness appears to the mind itself as intellect when in that form in which it does not pass from place to place.

4.23 The mind is said to perceive when it reflects both the indweller (the knower) and the objects of perception (the known).

4.24 Though variegated by innumerable tendencies, the mind acts not for itself but for another, for the mind is of compound substance.

4.25 For one who sees the distinction, there is no further confusing of the mind with the self.

4.26 Then the awareness begins to discriminate, and gravitates towards liberation.

4.27 Distractions arise from habitual thought patterns when practice is intermittent.

4.28 The removal of the habitual thought patterns is similar to that of the afflictions already described.

4.29 To one who remains undistracted in even the highest intellection there comes the equalminded realization known as The Cloud of Virtue. This is a result of discriminative discernment.

4.30 From this there follows freedom from cause and effect and afflictions.

4.31 The infinity of knowledge available to such a mind freed of all obscuration and property makes the universe of sensory perception seem small.

4.32 Then the sequence of change in the three attributes comes to an end, for they have fulfilled their function.

4.33 The sequence of mutation occurs in every second, yet is comprehensible only at the end of a series.

4.34 When the attributes cease mutative association with awarenessness, they resolve into dormancy in Nature, and the indweller shines forth as pure consciousness. This is absolute freedom.

31

32 Then the seamless flow of reality, its transformations colored by the fundamental qualities, begins to
break down, fulfilling the true mission of consciousness.

33 One can see that the flow is actually a series of discrete events, each corresponding to the merest
instant of time, in which one form becomes another.

34 Freedom is at hand when the fundamental qualities of nature, each of their transformations witnessed
at the moment of its inception, are recognized as irrelevant to pure awareness; it stands alone,
grounded in its very nature, the power of pure seeing.
That is all. -->
