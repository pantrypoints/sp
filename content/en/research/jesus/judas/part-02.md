Jesus then left, taking Judas Iscariot with him.


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
The water on the exalted mountain is from […] it didn't come to [water … the well] of the tree of [the fruit …] of this realm […] after a time […], but came to water God's paradise and the enduring [fruit], because [it] won't corrupt that generation's [walk of life], but [it will exist] for all eternity.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Judas" >}}
What kind of fruit does this generation have?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
The souls of every human generation will die. However, when these people have completed the time in the kingdom and the spirit leaves them, their bodies will die but their souls will live, and they'll be taken up.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
What will the rest of the human generations do?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
It's not possible to sow on rock and harvest its fruit. In the same way, it's not possible to sow on the defiled race along with the perishable wisdom and the hand which created mortal humans so that their souls may go up to the realms above.

No ruler, angel, or power will be able to see the places that this great, holy generation will see.

When Jesus said this, he left.

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
Master, just as you've listened to all of them, now listen to me too, because I've seen a great vision.
{{< /r >}}


But Jesus laughed when he heard this. 

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Why are you all worked up, you 13th demon? But speak up, and I'll bear with you.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
In the vision, I saw myself. The 12 disciples are stoning me and chasing me rapidly. I also came to the place where I had followed you. 

I saw a house in this place, and my eyes couldn't measure its size. Great people surrounded it, and that house had a roof of greenery. 

In the middle of the house was a crowd …. Master, take me in with these people!
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Your star has led you astray, Judas. No mortal is worthy to enter the house you've seen, because that place is reserved for those who are holy. 

Neither the sun nor the moon will rule there, nor the day, but those who are holy will always stand in the realm with the holy angels. I've told you the mysteries of the kingdom and I've taught you about the error of the stars and […] sent [on high] over the 12 realms.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
Master, surely my seed doesn't dominate the rulers, does it?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Come, let me tell you [about the holy generation. Not so that you'll go there, but you'll grieve much when you see the kingdom and all its generation.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
What good has it done me that you've separated me from that generation?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
You'll become the 13th, and will be cursed by the other generations and will rule over them. 

In the last days they'll […] to you and you won't go up to the holy generation.
