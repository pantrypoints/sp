{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Come and I'll teach you about the mysteries that no human will see, because there exists a great and boundless realm whose horizons no angelic generation has seen, in which is a great invisible Spirit, which no angelic eye has ever seen, no heart has ever comprehended, and it's never been called by any name.

A luminous cloud (Spirit) appeared there. He said:
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Spirit" >}}
Let an angel come into being to attend me.
{{< /r >}}


A great angel, the Self-Begotten, the God of the Light, emerged from the cloud. Because of him, another 4 angels came into being from another cloud. They attended the angelic Self-Begotten.


{{< l a="Self-Begotten" >}}
Let a realm come into being. 
{{< /l >}}

And it came into being just as he said. He created the first luminary to rule over it.

{{< l a="Self-Begotten" >}}
Let angels come into being to serve it.
{{< /l >}}

Myriads without number came into being.

{{< l a="Self-Begotten" >}}
Let a luminous realm come into being
{{< /l >}}

And it came into being. 

He created the second luminary to rule over it, along with myriads of angels without number to offer service. 

That's how he created the rest of the realms of light. And he made them to be ruled, and created for them myriads of angels without number to assist them.


Adamas was in the first cloud of light that no angel could ever see among all those called 'God.' 

Adamas begat Seth in that place after the image of … and after the likeness of this angel. 

He made the incorruptible generation of Seth appear to the 12 androgynous luminaries*. And then, he made 72 luminaries appear in the incorruptible generation according to the Spirit's will.


{{< n n="These are the same as the 12 zodiacs in Timaeus." >}}


Then the 72 luminaries themselves made 360 luminaries appear in the incorruptible generation according to the Spirit's will so that there would be 5 for each [360/72].

The 12 realms of the 12 luminaries make up their father, with 6 heavens for each realm so there are 72 heavens for the 72 luminaries, and for each one of them 5 firmaments for a total of 360 firmaments.

They were given authority and a great army of angels <!-- without number --> for honor and service, along with virgin spirits for the honor and service of all the realms and the heavens with their firmaments.
- The father and the 72 luminaries with the Self-Begotten and his 72 realms called the crowd of those immortals as 'cosmos' – that is, 'perishable'. 

That is where the first human appeared with his incorruptible powers. 

In the realm that appeared with his generation is the cloud of knowledge and the angel called 'Eleleth' …. 

After these things, Eleleth said:


{{< r a="Eleleth" >}}
Let 12 angels come into being to rule over Chaos and Hades. Look, from the cloud there appeared an angel whose face flashed with fire and whose likeness was defiled by blood.
{{< /r >}}


His name was Nebro, which means Rebel. 
- Others call him Yaldabaoth. 

Another angel, Saklas, came from the cloud too. So Nebro created 6 angels. 

Saklas did too – to be assistants. They brought out 12 angels in the heavens, with each of them receiving a portion in the heavens.

The 12 rulers spoke with the 12 angels: 

'Let each of you […] and let them […] generation [… 5] angels:

1. Yaoth. He is called 'the Good One'
2. Harmathoth, the eye of fire
3. Galila
4. Yobel
5. Adonaios

These are the 5 who ruled over Hades and are the first over Chaos.

Then Saklas said to his angels:

{{< r a="Saklas" >}}
Let's create a human being after the likeness and the image.
{{< /r >}}


They fashioned Adam and his wife Eve, who in the cloud is called 'Life' because by this name all the generations seek him, and each of them calls her by their names. 

Saklas did not [command …] give birth, except […] among the generations […] which this […] and the [angel] said to him, 

{{< r a="Angel" >}}
Your life will last for a limited time, with your children.
{{< /r >}}
