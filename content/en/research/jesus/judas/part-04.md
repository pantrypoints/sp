{{< r a="Judas" >}}
How long can a person live?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Why are you amazed that the lifespans of Adam and his generation are limited in the place he's received his kingdom with his ruler?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
Does the human spirit die?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
God commanded Michael to loan spirits to people so that they might serve. Then the Great One commanded Gabriel to give spirits to the great generation with no king – the spirit along with the soul. 

So the [rest] of the souls […] light [… the] Chaos […] seek [the] spirit within you which you've made to live in this flesh from the angelic generations. 

Then God caused knowledge to be brought to Adam and those with him, so that the kings of Chaos and Hades might not rule over them.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
So what will those generations do?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
The stars complete all these things. 

When Saklas completes the time span that's been determined for him, their first star will appear with the generations. They'll finish what's been said. 

Then they'll sleep around in my name, murder their children, and they'll …]evil and […] the realms, bringing the generations and presenting them to Saklas. 

After that […] will bring the 12 tribes of Israel from […], and the generations will all serve Saklas, sinning in my name. 

Your star will rule over the 13th realm.
{{< /l >}}


Then Jesus laughed.

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
Master, why [are you laughing at me?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
I'm not laughing at you, but at the error of the stars. These six stars go astray with these 5 warriors. They'll all be destroyed along with their creations.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Judas" >}}
What will those do who've been baptized in your name?
{{< /r >}}

 

## The Betrayal

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
This baptism which they've received in my name […] will destroy the whole generation of the earthly Adam. 

Tomorrow, they'll torture the one who bears me. No hand of a mortal human will fall on me. Judas, those who offer sacrifices to Saklas […] everything that's evil. 

But you'll do more than all of them, because you'll sacrifice the human who bears me. 

Your horn has already been raised, your anger has been kindled, your star has ascended, and your heart has strayed.

Your last [… and] the [… the thrones] of the realm have been defeated. The kings have grown weak, the angelic generations have grieved, and the evil [they sowed …] is destroyed. The [ruler] is wiped out.

And then the fruit of the great generation of Adam will be exalted, because before heaven, earth, and the angels, that generation from the realms exists. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Look, you've been told everything. 

Lift up your eyes and see the cloud with the light in it and the stars around it. The star that leads the way is your star.
{{< /l >}}

Then Judas looked up and saw the luminous cloud, and he entered it. Those standing on the ground heard a voice from the cloud saying, "[ . . . the] great [generation . . . ] and [ . . . ]." 

Judas didn't see Jesus anymore.

Immediately there was a disturbance among [the] Jews, more than […] 

Their high priests grumbled because he'd gone into the guest room to pray. But some scribes were there watching closely so they could arrest him during his prayer, because they were afraid of the people, since they all regarded him as a prophet.


They approached Judas and said to him:

{{< r a="Priests" >}}
What are you doing here? Aren't you Jesus' disciple?
{{< /r >}}


Then he answered them as they wished. Then Judas received some money and handed him over to them.
