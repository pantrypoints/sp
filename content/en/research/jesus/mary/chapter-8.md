<sup>10</sup>  Desire said:

{{< r a="Desire" >}}
I did not see you descending, but now I see you ascending. Why do you lie since you belong to me?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Soul" >}}
<sup>11</sup> I saw you. You did not see me nor recognize me. I served you as a garment and you did not know me.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>12</sup> Then the soul went away rejoicing greatly.

<sup>13</sup> The soul met the third power called ignorance.


{{< r a="Ignorance" >}}
<sup>14</sup> Where are you going? In wickedness are you bound. But you are bound; do not judge!
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Soul" >}}
<sup>15</sup> Why do you judge me, even if I have not judged?

<sup>16</sup> I was bound, though I have not bound.

<sup>17</sup> I was not recognized. But I have recognized that the All is being dissolved, both the earthly things and the heavenly.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>18</sup> When the soul had overcome Ignorance, it went upwards and saw the fourth power, which took 7 forms.

<sup>19</sup> The 7 powers of wrath are:

1. Darkness
2. Desire
3. Ignorance
4. The excitement of death
5. The kingdom of the flesh
6. The foolish wisdom of flesh
7. Wrathful wisdom

{{< n n="These are the negative interpretations of the 7 chakras" >}}


{{< r a="Wrath" >}}
Where do you come from, slayer of men? Where are you going, conqueror of space?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Soul" >}}
<sup>21</sup> What binds me has been slain, and what turns me about has been overcome. <sup>22</sup> My desire has been ended, and ignorance has died.

<sup>23</sup> In a aeon I was released from a world, and in a Type from a type, and from the fetter of oblivion which is transient.

<sup>24</sup> From this time on will I attain to the rest of the time, of the season, of the aeon, in silence.
