<sup>1</sup> When Mary had said this, she fell silent, since it was to this point that the Savior had spoken with her.

<sup>2</sup> But Andrew answered and said to the brethren:

 <!-- Say what you wish to say about what she has said. I at least  -->

{{< r a="Andrew" >}}
I do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are strange ideas.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>3</sup> Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things.

<sup>4</sup> He questioned them about the Savior: 

{{< r a="Simon-Peter" >}}
Did He really speak privately with a woman and not openly to us? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did He prefer her to us?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>5</sup> Then Mary wept and said to Peter:

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think that I have thought this up myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Levi" >}}
<sup>6</sup> [To Peter] Peter you have always been hot tempered.

<sup>7</sup> You are contending against the woman like the adversaries.

<sup>8</sup> But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her very well.

<sup>9</sup> That is why He loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect Man, and separate as He commanded us and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>10</sup> When they heard this they began to go forth to proclaim and to preach.
