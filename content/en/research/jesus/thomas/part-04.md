{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>25</sup> Love your brother like your soul, guard him like the pupil of your eye.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>26</sup> You see the mote in your brother's eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eye. When you cast the beam out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to
cast the mote from your brother's eye.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>27</sup> If you do not fast as regards the world, you will not find the kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the father.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>28</sup> I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. 

I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. 

My soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. 

But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent."

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>29</sup> If the flesh came into being because of spirit, it is a wonder. 

But if spirit came into being because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders. I am amazed at how this great wealth has made its home in this poverty.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>30</sup> "Where there are three gods, they are gods. Where there are two or one, I
am with him."

<sup>31</sup> No prophet is accepted in his own village; no physician heals those who
know him."

<sup>32</sup> "A city being built on a high mountain and fortified cannot fall, nor can it
be hidden."
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>33</sup> Preach from your housetops that which you will hear in your ear. For no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel, nor does he put it in a hidden place, but rather he sets it on a lamp stand so that everyone who enters and leaves will see its light."

<sup>34</sup> "If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a pit."

<sup>35</sup> "It is not possible for anyone to enter the house of a strong man and take it by force unless he binds his hands; then he will (be able to) ransack his house."

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>36</sup> Do not be concerned from morning until evening and from evening until morning about what you will wear.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Disciples" >}}
<sup>37</sup> When will you become revealed to us and when shall we see you?
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
When you disrobe without being ashamed and take up your garments and place them under your feet like little children and tread on them, then will you see the son of the living one, and you will not be afraid
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>38</sup> Many times have you desired to hear these words which I am saying to you, and you have no one else to hear them from. There will be days when you will look for me and will not find me.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>39</sup> The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis)
and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those
who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>40</sup> A grapevine has been planted outside of the father, but being unsound, it
will be pulled up by its roots and destroyed.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>41</sup> Whoever has something in his hand will receive more, and whoever has
nothing will be deprived of even the little he has.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>42</sup> Become passers-by."
