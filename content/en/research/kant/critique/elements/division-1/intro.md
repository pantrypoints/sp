<!-- SS I. Introduction -->

Intuition relates our knowledge to objects. 

<!-- In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to objects, it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them is by means of an . To this as the indispensable groundwork, all thought points.  -->

An intuition can take place if an object affects the mind in a certain way.

Sensibility is the capacity for receiving representations through objects.
- This then gives us intuition.
- Intution creates thoughts which form ideas.

<!-- conceptions. -->

 <!-- (receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects,   -->

<!-- By means of sensibility, therefore, objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; by the understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions. But an thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs, relate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us. -->


Sensation is the object's effect on the faculty of representation.

Empirical intuition is the intuition which relates to an object through sensation.

Phenomenon is the undetermined object of an empirical intuition.

Matter is the phenomenon that corresponds to the sensation.

Form is the arrangement of the content of the phenomenon under certain relations.


But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and by which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itself sensation. 

Matter is from sensory perceptions.

<!--  give our minds the  lead to the

The form must lie ready within-the-mind for the matter that will come into the mind. 

 <!-- a priori for them in the mind, and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation. -->

Pure representations are those that are not from physical sensation. 

 <!-- pure, in the transcendental meaning of the word, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation.  -->

<!-- And accordingly we find existing in the mind a priori,  -->

The mind has pure forms* of sensuous passive-knowings. 
- The manifold content of the phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations through these forms. 

{{< n n="In Superphysics, these pre-existing forms in the mind are called samskaras" >}}

<!-- intuitions in general, in which all the  -->

Pure [Abstract] intuition is this pure [astract] form of sensibility.

I see a body which is represented to my mind as matter. 

From that representation, I remove all its:
- abstract properties as substance, force, divisibility, etc.
- physical properties as impenetrability, hardness, colour, etc.

Its size and shape is left.* These belong to pure intuition, which exists within-the-mind, as a mere form of sensibility, and without any real object of the senses or any sensation.

{{< n n="Why does Kant not delete size and shape? It means he cherry picks the spatial Layer (Air Element in ancient Physics). This is still not aethereal. An aethereal basis would be to unite all its physical and abstract properties and compare them to others. It means his transcendental aesthetic is a spatial metaphysics." >}}

<!-- yet there is still something left us from this empirical intuition, namely, extension and shape.  -->


Transcendental aesthetic* is the science of all the principles of within-the-mind sensibility.
- It is the first part of the Transcendental Doctrine of elements which is opposite of Transcendental logic which is the principles of pure [anstract] thought.

{{< f f="Kant footnote: The Germans are the only people who presently use 'aesthetic' as taste. Baumgarten tried to put beauty as a science but failed. This is beauty is sensory and so fail the within-the-mind rules. Therefore, aesthetic should not refer to taste or beauty, but only to sensibility." >}} 


<!-- At the foundation of this term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst, , conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science. But his endeavours were vain. For the said rules or criteria are, in respect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never can serve as determinate laws a priori, by which our judgement in matters of taste is to be directed. 

It is rather our judgement which forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles. 

On this account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating the critique of taste, and to apply it solely to that doctrine, which is true science—the science of the laws of sensibility—and thus come nearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their well-known division of the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai noeta, or to share it with speculative philosophy, and employ it partly in a transcendental, partly in a psychological signification. -->


<!-- In the science of transcendental aesthetic accordingly, we shall first isolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty, by separating from it all that is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding, so that nothing be left but empirical intuition. In the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so that nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of phenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford a priori. From this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge a priori, namely, space and time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed. -->
