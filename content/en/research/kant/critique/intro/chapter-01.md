All our knowledge begins with experience.

The faculty of cognition can be used only through sensory objects.

These produce representations that make our understanding work to:
- compare, connect, or separate these
- convert the raw material of our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects called experience.

Therefore, in temporal terms, our knowledge begins with experience.

**But it does not follow that all arises out of experience.** 

Our empirical knowledge might be a compound of knowledge which:
- we receive through impressions
- come from the faculty of cognition itself.

<!-- (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion), an addition which we -->

In this case, we cannot distinguish the latter from the original sensory element.

 <!-- till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in separating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires close investigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there exists a -->

Is there a knowledge totally independent of experience and sensory impressions?

Knowledge of this kind is called a priori, in contradistinction to a posteriori empirical knowledge, which is sourced from experience.

<!-- But the expression, "a priori," is not as yet definite enough adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started. For, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we are wont to say, that this or that may be known a priori, because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a general rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.  -->

Thus, if a man undermined his house, we say, "he might know a priori that it would have fallen."
- He did not need to wait for the experience for it to actually fall. 

But still, he knew previously be experience that heavy bodies fall. 

<!-- a priori, he could not know even this much. -->

<!-- For, , and, consequently, that they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known to him previously, by means of experience. -->

"Knowledge a priori" is knowledge that is absolutely independent of all experience. It is either:

1. Pure

This has no empirical element mixed in. 

2. Impure

For example, the proposition, "Every change has a cause" is an impure apriori proposition because change can only be derived from experience.

 <!-- therefore, we shall in the sequel understand, not such as is independent of this or that kind of experience, but such as is . Opposed to this is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only a posteriori, that is, through experience.  -->

 <!-- Knowledge a priori is either pure or impure.  -->
