### 3. Philosophy Needs a Science to Determine Principles of Within-the-Mind Knowledge*


{{< n n="This is already addressed by the Asian Sciences and by Superphysics" >}}

<!-- ### III. Philosophy stands in need of a Science which shall Determine the Possibility, Principles, and Extent of Human Knowledge "a priori" -->

<!-- Of far more importance than all that has been above said, is the consideration that certain of  -->

Some of our cognitions rise completely above physicality. 

<!-- the sphere of all possible experience, and by means of conceptions, to which there exists in the whole extent of experience no corresponding object, seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds.  -->

- These are in the transcendental or supersensible sphere where our experience cannot guide us.*

{{< n n="The Europeans are ignorant of the akasha or aether and so they have no guidance on metaphysical dynamics." >}}

This is addressed by the investigations of reason which is superior to the senses.

 <!-- which, on account of their importance, we consider far preferable to, and as having a far more elevated aim than, all that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous phenomena.  -->

<!-- So high a value do we set upon these investigations, that even at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the pursuit. These unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are God, freedom (of will), and immortality.  -->


This science is caled metaphysics.
- It is at the very outset dogmatical.

 <!-- that is, it confidently takes upon itself the execution of this task without any previous investigation of the ability or inability of reason for such an undertaking. -->

<!-- Now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned, it seems nevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with the cognitions we possess, without knowing whence they come, and on the strength of principles, the origin of which is undiscovered. Instead of thus trying to build without a foundation, it is rather to be expected that we should long ago have put the question,  -->


How does the understanding arrive at these within-the-mind cognitions?

<!-- , and what is the extent, validity, and worth which they may possess? We say, "This is natural enough," meaning by the word natural, that which is consistent with a just and reasonable way of thinking; but if we understand by the term, that which usually happens, nothing indeed could be more natural and more comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long unattempted.  -->

<!-- For one part of our pure knowledge,  -->

The science of mathematics is an absolutely within-the-mind knowledge.
- It has been long firmly established.
- It is a brilliant example of how far, independently of all experience, we may carry our within-the-mind knowledge.


<!-- and thus leads us to form flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may be of quite a different nature. Besides, when we get beyond the bounds of experience, we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter; and the charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that, unless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction, we hurry on undoubtingly in our course. This, however, may be avoided, if we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, which are not the less fictions on that account. -->


The mathematician occupies himself with cognitions represented by intuition.

But that intuition is also within-the-mind. Therefore, it is also an absolute within-the-mind conception.  

<!--  can itself be given a priori, and 

  is hardly to be distinguished from a mere pure conception.  -->

<!-- Deceived by such a proof of the power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of our knowledge. 

The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose resistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more free and rapid in airless space. -->

Plato abandoned the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to the understanding.

We likewise venture on the wings of ideas beyond the sense, into the void space of pure intellect. 

He did not reflect that he made no real progress by all his efforts.

<!-- for he met with no resistance which might serve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which he might apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentum for its progress.

It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason in speculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as possible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the foundation is a solid one or no.  -->

<!-- Arrived at this point, all sorts of excuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want of stability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous an investigation. 

But what frees us during the process of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters us into the belief of its solidity, is this. -->

The greatest part of the business of our reason is in the analysis of our ideas of objects. 

<!-- the ideas  conceptions which we already possess of objects.  -->

This gives us many ideas. 

<!-- By this means we gain a multitude of cognitions, which although really nothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which (though in a confused manner) was already thought in our conceptions, are, at least in respect of their form, prized as new introspections;  -->

<!-- whilst, so far as regards their matter or content, we have really made no addition to our conceptions, but only disinvolved them.  -->

This process gives us real within-the-mind knowledge which deceives the mind. This makes the mind assert the different things. 

<!-- , which has a sure progress and useful results, reason, deceived by this, slips in, without being itself aware of it, assertions of a quite different kind; in which, to given conceptions it adds others, a priori indeed, but entirely foreign to them, without our knowing how it arrives at these, and, indeed, without such a question ever suggesting itself. I shall therefore at once proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of knowledge. -->
