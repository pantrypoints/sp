<!-- If we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an edifice, the idea of which, at least, exists in the human mind, it may be said that we have in -->

The Transcendental Doctrine of Elements examined the materials of the abstract human mind. 

<!-- and determined to what edifice these belong, and what its height and stability.  -->

This let us build a home on Earth. But the lack of materials prevented us from building to go to the Heaven and sky. 

<!-- We have found, indeed, that, although we had purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach to Heaven, the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation, which was spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes, and high enough to enable us to survey the level plain of experience,  -->

We reach heaven by a plan to use the materials to build a path to go to heaven. 

<!-- but that the bold undertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materials—not to mention the confusion of tongues, which gave rise to endless disputes among the labourers on the plan of the edifice, and at last scattered them over all the world, each to erect a separate building for himself, according to his own plans and his own inclinations. Our present task relates not to the materials, but to the plan of an edifice; and, as we have had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design which may be found to transcend our natural powers, while, at the same time, we cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for the mind, we must proportion our design to the material which is presented to us, and which is, at the same time, sufficient for all our wants. -->

This plan is the transcendental doctrine of method.

It determines the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason.

<!-- We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, the canon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason. This part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendental point of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed, under the name of practical logic. It has been badly executed, I say, because general logic, not being limited to any particular kind of cognition (not even to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor to any particular objects, it cannot, without borrowing from other sciences, do more than present merely the titles or signs of possible methods and the technical expressions, which are employed in the systematic parts of all sciences; and thus the pupil is made acquainted with names, the meaning and application of which he is to learn only at some future time. -->


## CHAPTER 1. The Discipline of Pure Reason

Negative judgements are the jealous enemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge.

<!-- —those which are so not merely as regards their logical form, but in respect of their content—are not commonly held in especial respect. 

They are, on the contrary, regarded as ; and it almost requires an apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respect them. -->

All propositions may be logically expressed in a negative form.

<!-- but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiar province of -->

The purpose of negative judgements is solely to prevent error. 

<!-- For this reason, too, negative propositions, which are framed for the purpose of correcting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible, are undoubtedly true, but inane and senseless; that is, they are in reality purposeless and, for this reason, often very ridiculous.  -->

An example is the schoolman proposition that Alexander could not have subdued any country without an army.

<!-- But where the limits of our possible cognition are very much contracted, the attraction to new fields of knowledge great, the illusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character, and the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitude—,  which is useful only to guard us against error, -->

The negative element in knowledge is much more important than much of that positive instruction which adds to our knowledge.

Discipline is the restraint employed to repress and extirpate the constant inclination to depart from certain rules.

Culture aims to form a certain degree of skill, without repressing or destroying any other existing mental power.

Discipline is different from culture. 

In the cultivation of talent for self-development:
- culture and doctrine is positive
- discipline is negative*

<!-- [*Footnote: I am well aware that, in the language of the schools, the term discipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction. But there are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the
notion of the former, as a course of corrective training, from that of
the latter, as the communication of knowledge, and the nature of things
itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable expressions for
this distinction, that it is my desire that the former terms should
never be employed in any other than a negative signification.] -->


Examples of natural dispositions and talents are imagination and wit. 

These ask a free and unlimited development. These require the corrective influence of discipline.

The proper duty of reason is to prescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind.
- It is strange that reason requires this corrective discipline. 

It has hitherto escaped this humiliation only because no one saw it capable of substituting:
- fancies for conceptions, and
- words for things.

 <!-- in presence of its magnificent pretensions and high position,  -->

When reason is employed in experience, it does not need criticism. This is because its principles are subjected to the continual test of empirical observations. 

Criticism is not needed in mathematics where:
- the conceptions of reason must always be presented in concreto in pure intuition
- baseless or arbitrary assertions are discovered easily.

But where reason is not held in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pure intuition, that is, 

But when reason is employed in the transcendental sphere of pure conceptions, it needs great discipline:
- to restrain its propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and 
- to keep it from wandering into error.

In fact, the utility of the philosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character. 

Particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions. The causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism. 

But where we find, as in the case of pure reason, a complete system of illusions and fallacies, closely connected with each other and depending on grand general principles, there seems to be required a peculiar and negative code of mental laws. 

These laws:
- are a discipline, founded on the nature of reason and the objects of its exercise.
- constitute a system of thorough examination and testing, which no disguised fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from

<!-- , under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk. -->

This Division 2 of my transcendental Critique of the discipline of pure reason is not directed to the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason. 

The content has been completed in the doctrine of elements.

There is so much similarity in the mode of employing reason in whatever object.

But its employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially different from every other.

Without the warning negative influence of a discipline specially directed to that end, errors will be unavoidable.

Those errors spring from the unskillful employment of the methods which are originated by reason but out of place in this sphere.
