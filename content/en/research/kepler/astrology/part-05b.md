<!-- The reason why the effect of under-->
{{< s v="39" >}} Two planets so effectively increases the actual bend of an aspect. This is because of a vital capability.

1. On one side, this capability dwells in the capacity of the geometrical pattern and which forms the aspects.
2. On the other side, this dwells in the capability of the body in which all this operates, in which that influence fulfills.*

{{< n n="Cause 1 is the actual aetherspace or extension or shape of the body. Cause 2 is the virtual space particles between those bodies" >}}


It is not enough when 2 rays unite in some angle. 

Variable angle is formed by 2 rays also the day before and after the aspect.

But the effect occurs in the moment when the angle has a ratio exactly corresponding to given aspect. 

**If the angle does not form an aspect, there is no effect.**

The same thing occurs during the movement of the body.

It is absurd to claim that a man moves objects by simply looking at them.

<!-- without necessity to use his body to execute a move. -->


{{< s v="40" >}} **That capability which gives power to the aspects does not reside in stars themselves.** 

Those aspects affect the Earth.
- Those effects do not come from the actual activity of the stars, **but from the certain position of 2 stars with regard to the Earth.**

This is because the vital power which gives motion to the bodies does not reside in objects.

Each physical object is an idea.
- The vital power is in the idea, not the physical object. 

This vital power* gives growth, movement and life to the planets.

{{< n n="*prana in the Asian sciences" >}}

<!-- But it is there where the kind of the object is represented (it is represented in the ideas of the objects) thus this power, which  -->

Any vital capability is a picture of geometricizing God in His creation.
- This picture is provoked to action through those heavenly geometries or harmonies of aspects.


{{< s v="41" >}} The perfect activities of the Earth are:

<!-- To a lazy thinker, this philosophy will seem to be what it is not, unless I generalize a bit the ancient dogmas hitherto prevailing. 

At first, regarding the Earth, no one can deny that its shape as a whole is more evident than
the one which is visible in every clod.  -->
- the generation of metals
- preservation of terrestrial heat
- exudation of vapours through progeneration of streams
- rains and other atmospheric conditions

These prove that it comes from some kind of vital power. 

It shows that the image of Earth is not simple, as it occurs for instance in stones.
- Instead, it is an image which gives life.


{{< s v="42" >}} The Earth has its own motion.

It does not have a human soul nor the characteristics of animals or plants.

**But it does have a vital power of its kind.** 

Thus, according to the ancients, some kind of vital power dwells:

1. In man
2. In animals
3. In plants
4. In the Earth


{{< s v="43" >}}  Should be absurd and unjustifiable to attribute to the vital power the ability to understand geometry, and at the
same time to consider it to be a kind of unanimated object.

An example is a tree. 

The tree does not have common sense. 

Yet it can – upon command of the Creator – progenerate an exact pattern of leaves for the benefit of the fruit and for its own
growth. 

Every single seed retains beauty which comes from numbers. 

Many plants are quinary (with leaves in five-fold pattern), not for material need to transform an apple from the tree – it would not be possible to keep the quinary during such a transformation.

Instead, qunary is needed for the creative connection, which has a beauty innate to a quinary pattern. 

The description given above is enigmatic because the power remains inside.
- It spreads the quinary it posesses.

Another example is a simple man who does not meditate on a geometric proportion, which a sound has to another sound.

Yet he hears the outer harmony of stringed instruments and gives him joy.

 <!-- enters his mind through his ears -->

However, this joy is not from:
- the regulation of mingling sounds
- gentle ear-soothing (for some sounds are often hurtful, and nevertheless their harmony causes delight)
- any other cause hitherto detected

Instead, this joy is from the fact that **geometry creates a form of harmony**.*

{{< n n="This is the 'fit' in the shape of each particle to another" >}}


I will show this in Harmonia Mundi.

Thus, I believe that:
- the Earth has life-giving mobile power
- there is a kind of geometrical emotion in that power

This is because this power is some kind of mobile capability, which is stimulated on a high level when nourished by harmonious aspects.*

{{< n n="Descartes later explained this as the mechanics of animal spirits or chi" >}}


In this way, the ear is stimulated by harmony to sharp listening and hearing.

Likwise, the Earth is stimulated by geometrical connection of accelerating rays (of the warm and wet power).

This lets the Earth itself:
- accelerate the functions of plants
- exude a lot of vapour.


{{< s v="44" >}} However, the influences of aspects slightly differ from various characteristics or nature of planets.

The Earth is influenced by geometrical mingling of contraries of:
- influences of Saturn and Mars on one side, and
- influences of Jupiter and Venus on the other side.

This occurs almost in the same way as we observe in the bowels, where an abundance of:
- laxatives causes movement of liquids
- argument causes the same occurence in the bile.


The geometrical characteristics of rays lacks capability of colour and other qualities.

This means that the basic diversity of influence of aspects comes from the disposition of bodies. 

Such a disposition is important especially for Earth, which is different in different times and at different places. 

During springtime, there is an abundance of humidity in the middle of the northern part of Earth because of its closeness to the Sun.

Even the slightest aspect of any planet forces this power of Earth to grow up and to exude vapour to produce rains.

At some other time or place, even the strongest aspect may stimulate the Earth.

But the effect may be weak due to the lack of proper earthly disposition.
