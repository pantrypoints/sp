{{< s v="63" >}} I left out configurations between Moon and other planets for reason I stated above. 

Nevertheless, we cannot leave out:
- her ecliptical meetings with the Sun before the beginning of the year
- 2 ecliptical Full Moons on opposite sides of the sky.

One at 17°GEM48´ which will:
- start in the afternoon on December 9, at 5 hours 7 minutes
- end at 8 hours 33 minutes, if observed in Prague. 

It is very close to the calculation which had been made by Tycho.

Central annular eclipse of the Sun at New Moon, 12/24/1601, 02°CAP54´07´´

Eclipse at Full Moon 12/09/1601 18:56:23 Moon 17°GEM52´47´´ and Sun in opposition in SAG

Another eclipse of the Moon will occur on June 4, 1602, on 13°SAG32´. 

It will start below horizon at 4 hours 52 minutes after noon and it will end at 9 hours 6 minutes in the evening.

Eclipse at Full Moon 06/04/1602 19:17:00 Moon 13°SAG39´28´´ and Sun in opposition in GEM Eclipse of the Sun on December 24, as I calculated it, will:
- start at 1 hour 17 minutes afternoon
- end at 2 hours 42 minutes on 2°CAP53´, 10 grades above horizon, before the sunset. 

This eclipse is very remarkable.

If the eclipses can influence something, then this one will have a great impact mostly in northern regions, where it will also be best observable.

The eclipse was noticeable in northern latitudes from 47N52 to 59N48

I do not know if and how the effect would show up in forthcoming year. 

According to the rules of Ptolemy, the effects are uncertain and not quite corresponding with nature. 

In 1598, there was total eclipse in Pisces. As the Sun was in September in opposite sign Virgo, there were abundant rains. 

In 1600, there was an eclipse in Cancer. 

When the Sun enters the signs of Gemini and Cancer during eclipse, the weather will be wet not only at that time, but during the whole summer. 

Experts in those occurences can validate whether the considerations go ahead in correct direction, if I reject the forecast from this eclipse for December 1602 and the whole winter, and deduce from signs very cold weather. 

If the eclipses gain their power from celestial sign, and all 3 eclipses will occur in aspects to Jupiter and Mars, therefore there are imminent adverse effects on Jupiter´s nature, thus, the following warmth and adverse strong humidity will cause bad harvest.


{{< s v="64" >}} On November 28, another eclipse of the Moon will be noticeable in West.

It will start, according also to Tycho´s calculations, here in Prague almost in the same moment when Sun rises and Moon sets. 

Eclipse at Full Moon 11/29/1602 09:38:23 Moon at 07°GEM 0´12´´ and Sun in opposition in SAG

Here it is necessary to point out that all obtainable publications of this treatise in Thesis 64 mention the date November 28.
Two explanations are possible.

The first one, which is obvious, is the misprint. 

Regarding the accuracy of Kepler´s work, which is evident in Thesis 63, it is possible to take into consideration the misprint which could be made already by the first typesetter, and which has been repeated due to simple copying of the treatise without control of calculations. 

Another, more interesting explanation could be the calendar.


{{< f f="*Translator's Note: In Kepler´s time, days were counted starting from noon. Then, the November 28th, as the A.M. hour of the following day, would be correct. Which explanation is the right one, we leave to our inquiring reader to work out" >}}



Regarding the eclipse, which will be observable on the West on June 19, I wonder if it will cause tragic commotion?

Partial eclipse of the Sun at New Moon 06/19/1602 21:18:09 at 28°GEM 02´36´´

It is ridiculous when people think that the eclipse is ominous, regarding the fact how many of them occur each year.

As if there were not 4-5 eclipses every year, considering the whole circumference of Earth. 

Those people deceive themselves. Origanus, in his recently published Ephemeris, calculated many eclipses occuring all over the orb – such an information was not available before. 

As they did not know Origanus´computing method, those tragic loudmouths never felt eclipses which occured below our horizon. They pay attention to celestial occurences in vain, if they are surprised by the Origanus´method.

{{< s v="65" >}} Forecasts regarding harvest are naturally very uncertain. Everyone knows about the divine providence. The harvest depends:
- partly on occasional causes and
- partly on above mentioned natural dispositions of the year, the agents of which are impossible to foresee, because they are still being sought.

Even the astrological rules used by astrologers for corn, grapes, wine, olive oil, wheat etc. and also the characteristics of Jupiter in cardinal signs – all of it are but pointless dreams.

You ask why the grapevine didn´t grow well this year? It was because it has been a cold and wet year.

Anyone able to foresee this (the bad growth), could do so just and only on basis of this fact.

Why was the harvest rich in one region, and poor in another?

It happened because some regions were wet due to some internal and still undisclosed dispositions of Earth, as we discussed earlier, and the summer was sufficiently clear, whereas there was dryness in other regions, which damaged the fruits of Earth, and subsequently an earthquake could occur.

Sometimes the year is fruitful. 

But suddenly in just a day a loss may occur, caused by ground frosts in mountains and by flood in plains, spreading over the whole region depending on the course of the wind. The nature of winds is of great importance, because those are very changeable in our region.

Thus, it is silly to search for the causes of such an occurrencies in main points of equinox and solstice, when we have the obvious causes straight in front of sight. 

Lest I seem to be an upstart who ruins the art, I appeal to the authorities of Cardanus and Tycho.
