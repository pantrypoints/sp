{{< q a="Proclus Diadochus" c="Commentary on Euclid Book 1" >}}
Mathematics contributes very important things to the study of nature. It reveals the orderly nature of the reasoning, in accordance with which the whole has been constructed, and showing that the primary elements took on the appropriate forms and are connected together with symmetry and regularity.

We must seek the causes of the harmonic proportions in the divisions of a circle into equal aliquot parts.
- These are made geometrically from the constructible regular plane shapes. 

It is totally unknown how the mind distinguishes geometrical objects.

In fact, among the ancients, only Euclid and his commentator Proclus knew exactly these distinguishing features of geometrical objects. 

**Every single part of the subject of geometry creates certain mental attitudes.** 

These attitudes can be explained by dividing problems into planes, solids, and lines, as done by Pappus of Alexandria and his followers. 

However he is both:
- brief in words
- focused on practice

He never mentions his theory. We need to know his theory otherwise we never will be able to take in the harmonic ratios. 

Proclus Diadochus published 4 books on the first book of Euclid. He played the part of a theoretical philosopher dealing with a mathematical subject.

His commentaries on book 10 of Euclid has relieved me totally from this toil of explaining the distinguishing features of geometrical objects.

**Geometrical objects are entities of the mind which are different from each other, just as living entities are different.** 

Euclid established the basic principles of the whole essence of mathematics to know such differences such as:
- the end versus the endless
- the limit versus the unlimited

<!-- For from the very outset it is readily apparent that those distinctions between  would have been known, since he 
 as the same which also pervade all entities and generate them all from themselves, --> 

He recognized that:
- the limit as the form [shape]
- the unlimited [line] as the material of geometrical objects

Shape and proportion in general are properties of quantities.

The shape of individual quantities and proportion are properties of those quantities combined.

Shape is demarcated by limits. 

Examples of such limits are:
- the points that limit a straight line
- the lines that limit a plane surface
- surfaces that limit a 3D solid

Therefore:
- finite shapes can also be grasped by the mind through definitions and bonds of constructions
- infinite things cannot be known [defined]

{{< n n="In Superphysics, shapes are definite ideas, lines are flows of cognition which are undefined i.e. ideas are shapes or particles, but feelings are line-waves" >}}


Shapes are:
- an archetype prior to becoming produced
- in the divine mind prior to being in creatures
- different in respect of their subject, but the same in the form of their essence. 

Therefore, in quantities, shape is a kind of their mental essence. 

This essence is made clearer through proportions.

<!-- , or understanding is their essential distinguishing feature. That is much clearer from the case of . -->

Shape is demarcated by several limits. 

Shapes gain proportion when they are many. 

However, this proportion, without the action of the mind, is something which cannot be understood in any way.

 <!-- it comes about that on account of their being plural shape partakes of proportions.  -->

Hence by the same reasoning, **one who gives limits to quantities as their essential basis supposes that quantities which have shapes have an intellectual essence**. 

But there is no need for arguments, as explained by Proclus’ book. 

The intellectual distinguishing features of geometrical objects were properly known to him. 
<!-- , although he does not make such an open and conspicuous declaration of that point as a separate thing on its own, so as to put even a dozing reader in mind of it.  -->
- He is completely an abstruse Platonist. 
 <!-- swathed in most plentiful doctrines of rather  philosophy; and among them is this point, which is the single argument of this Book. -->

However, our age has had no room to penetrate such hidden mysteries. 

Proclus' book was read by Petrus Ramus who <!-- , but as far as the core of philosophy is concerned, it was  --> despised and rejected it equally with Book 10 of Euclid.

<!-- He who had written a commentary on Euclid was angrily repudiated by Petrus Ramus who condemned Euclid's Book 10: -->
<!-- and instructed ’ to lose his voice, as if he had written a defense for him.  -->

<!-- The unjust and peevish anger of a hostile critic turns against Euclid as if he were on criticism trial: the tenth Book of Euclid  -->
<!-- was condemned to the atrocious sentence of not being read, though if it were read and understood it could
lay bare the secrets of philosophy. -->

<!-- Read the words of Ramus, than which he has never uttered anything more unworthy of Ramus. (ScholaeMathematicae {MathematicalSchools), Book 21.)  -->

 <!-- in literature or the arts — obscurity, I mean, not for the understanding of what Euclid is saying (for that may be quite clear to the unlearned and unlettered if they pay attention to it, that is only what is there and what is present in the text)  -->

{{< q a="Ramus" >}}
The subject material of Book 10 is so obscure. It thoroughly understands and investigates its goals such as the kinds and distinguishing features of objects. I have never read or heard anything so confused. The superstition of the Pythagoreans seems to have invaded this cave.
{{< /q >}}

But my goodness, Ramus, if it was too hard to understand why would you slander it as obscure? 

Until you grasp the writer’s intention, you need:
- harder work
- tranquillity
- concentration
- mental exertion, above all

 <!-- then at last, seeing that it , it is exultantly flooded with incredible pleasure, and in that, as it were, watch tower,  -->

After the mind has struggled to that point and has reached the light of truth, it will perceive with precision the whole world and all the distinguishing features of its parts. 

But you: 
- act as the patron of ignorance with the common herd of men, and
- snatch at profit from everything, divine or human

<!-- You make “prodigious sophisms” as your comments of:
- “Euclid incontinently abusing his leisure” 
- “these subtleties have no place in geometry”  -->

<!-- Let your part be to carp at what you do not understand.

I am a hunter for the causes of things. Only Book 10 of Euclid opened the paths to them.
