AN act of individual saving is a decision not to have dinner today. But it does lead to a spending of that saving to buy dinner at a later date. 

<!--  not necessitate a decision to have dinner or to buy a pair of boots a week hence or a year hence or to consume any specified thing at any specified date.  -->

Thus, it depresses the food service business <!-- of preparing to-day’s dinner --> or other consumption businesses. <!--  without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption. --> It is a net reduction of such demand. <!-- not a substitution of future consumption-demand for present consumption-demand. --> 

The expectation of future consumption is based on present consumption. A reduction in present consumption will likely depress future consumption. This will result in the act of saving:
- depressing the price of consumption-goods
- leaving the marginal efficiency of existing capital unaffected. 

It might depress the latter also by present investment-demand and present consumption-demand. 

It will be different if the saving was meant for a future spending. <!-- If saving consisted not merely in abstaining from present consumption but in placing simultaneously a specific order for future consumption, the effect might indeed be different.  --> In this case, the expectation of some future yield from investment would be improved. The resources saved could be used for preparing for that future consumption. 

<!-- Not that they necessarily would be, even in this case, on a scale equal to the amount of resources released; since the desired interval of delay might require a method of production so inconveniently “roundabout” as to have an efficiency well below the current rate of interest, with the result that the favourable effect on employment of the forward order for consumption would eventuate not at once but at some subsequent date, so that the immediate effect of the saving would still be adverse to employment.  -->

<!-- An individual decision to save does not involve the placing of any specific forward order for consumption, but merely the cancellation of a present order.  -->

The expectation of consumption is the only raison d'être of employment.
- A reduced propensity to consume depresses employment. 

The act of saving implies a desire for “wealth” for a future time. It does guarantee a future consumption. 

<!-- It does not substitute our present consumption of some specific additional consumption which requires for its preparation just as much immediate economic activity as would have been required by present consumption equal in value to the sum saved, but  -->

The idea that individual saving* is just as good for effective demand as an act of individual consumption is false.
{{< /c >}}


{{< n n="Here, Keynes confuses 'saving' with 'abstaining' or putting money under a pillow. Classical savings always implies saving money in a bank. Thus, the correct Classical phrase is: 'Individual saving IN A BANK is just as good for effective demand'" >}}



<!-- The absurd, though almost universal, idea that an act of , has been fostered by the fallacy, much more specious than the conclusion derived from it, that  -->

Classical Economics has a fallacy that an increased desire to hold wealth is the same thing as an increased desire to hold investments.
- This desire:
  - increases the demand for investments
  - stimulates their production.
- In this way, current investment is promoted by individual saving just as present consumption is reduced.

These are fallacies coming from the idea that the owner of wealth wants a capital-asset for the sake of that asset* instead for its prospective yield.

{{< n n="This desire is actually the desire for security which Keynes called 'precautionary-motive' in Chapter 13. Adam Smith mentions this as kings hoarding treasure (massive treasure-saving) for the sake of security. How could Keynes forget his own principles? Here, he is strangely imposing the 'transactions-motive' on capital-owners, like telling an apple to be an orange." >}}


**Prospective yield wholly depends on the expectation of future effective demand in relation to future conditions of supply.**
- If an act of saving does nothing to improve prospective yield, it does not stimulate investment.
- For an individual saver to attain his desired goal of owning wealth, a new capital-asset is not needed to be produced to satisfy him. 

<!-- The mere act of saving by one individual  , being two-sided as we have shown above, forces some other individual to transfer to him some article of wealth old or new. Every act of saving involves a “forced” inevitable transfer of wealth to him who saves, though he in his turn may suffer from the saving of others. These transfers of wealth do not require the creation of new wealth — indeed, as we have seen, they may be actively inimical to it. -->

The creation of new wealth wholly depends on the prospective yield of the new wealth reaching the standard set by the current interest rate*.
- The prospective yield of the marginal new investment is not increased by someone wanting to increase his wealth. This is because the prospective yield of the marginal new investment depends on the expectation of a demand<!--  for a specific article at a specific date -->. 

{{< n n="Here Keynes imposes investments to mean money-investments" >}}


I impose that the owner of wealth wants <!--  is not a given prospective yield but --> the best available prospective yield. 
- In this way, an increased desire to have wealth now reduces the prospective future yield.
- Debt and money markets are also capital-assets, and so  the prospective yield <!-- with which the producers of new investment have to be content --> cannot fall below <!-- the standard set by --> the current interest rate. 

<!-- with which the producers of new investment have to be content. For this overlooks the fact that there is always an alternative to the ownership of real capital-assets, namely the ownership of money and debts; so that  -->

Interest rate depends<!-- , as we have seen, not on the strength of the desire to hold wealth, but --> on the strengths of the desires to hold wealth in liquid and in illiquid forms relative to <!--  respectively, coupled with the amount of --> the supply of wealth <!-- in the one form relatively to the supply of it in the other -->. 

<!-- If the reader still finds himself perplexed, let him ask himself why,  -->

If the quantity of money is unchanged, a fresh act of saving reduces the liquid money. <!--  should diminish the sum which it is desired to keep in liquid form at the existing rate of interest.  -->

<!-- Certain deeper perplexities, which may arise when we try to probe still further into the whys and wherefores, will be considered in the next chapter. II  -->




## Keynes Overturns the Classical Productive and Unproductive Capital in Favor of Money-Returns 

Instead of calling capital as "productive" it would be better to say that capital has a yield over the course of its life in excess of its original cost.

An asset's scarcity gives it a higher <!--  offers a prospect of yielding during its life services having an --> aggregate value greater than its initial supply price. It is kept scarce because of the competition of the interest rate on money. 

If capital becomes less scarce, the excess yield will diminish. Yet it will stay as productive at least in the physical sense*.


{{< n n="Here, Keynes applies sophistry. If everyone has access to a capital equipment, then the old capital equipment will not be used as much, rendering it less productive per equipment-unit. For example, 4G in mobile phones has made wifi routers unnecessary and therefore less productive to the eyes of society." >}}





<!-- I sympathise, therefore, with the pre-classical doctrine that everything is produced by labour, aided by what used to be called art and is now called technique, by natural resources which are free or cost a rent according to their scarcity or abundance, and by the results of past labour, embodied in assets, which also command a price according to their scarcity or abundance.  -->

We should <!-- It is preferable to --> regard labour*, including, of course, the personal services of the entrepreneur and his assistants, as the sole factor of production, operating in a given environment of:
- technique
- natural resources
- capital equipment
- effective demand. 


{{< n n="Here, Keynes makes land and stock subservient to labor, different from the Classical notion that puts all three as equal. Under Keynes' reasoning, money can be eased as to employ humans to make Antartica or the Sahara productive. This is absurd." >}}


This is why I used the unit of labour [common-labour] as the sole physical unit needed in my economic system, apart from units of money [money-wage] and time [hour].
