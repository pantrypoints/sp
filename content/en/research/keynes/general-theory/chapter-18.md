My proposed system has the following as a given:

- the existing skill and quantity of available labour
- the existing quality and quantity of available equipment
- the existing technique
- the degree of competition
- the tastes and habits of the consumer
- the disutility of:
  - different intensifies of labour and
  - the activities of supervision and organisation
- the social structure 

These:
- determine the distribution of the national income. 
- factors are not constant. 
- lead to the dependent variables:

1. The volume of employment
2. The national income <!-- (or national dividend) --> measured in hourly-common-wages <!-- wage-units. --> 

<!-- DCTI  -->

<!-- In this place and context, we are merely not considering or taking into account the effects and consequences of changes in them.  -->

These given factors and 2 dependent variables influence the 3 independent variables:

1. The propensity to consume
2. The curve of marginal efficiency of capital 
3. the interest rate

<!-- The factors, taken as given, --> 
<!-- - But they do not completely determine them.  -->

The marginal efficiency of capital curve depends:
- partly on the existing quantity of equipment
  - This is one of the given factors 
- partly on the state of long-term expectation
  - This cannot be inferred from the given factors. 

But there are other elements which the given factors determine so completely that they are necessary effects. <!-- we can treat these derivatives as being themselves given. -->

For example, from the given factors we can infer what will be the national income (measured in the hourly-common-wage) <!-- wage-unit --> for a given level of employment. 
- This makes the national income depend on the volume of employment
- It answers: What quantity of effort in production will lead to a level of income? [1]


The aggregate supply functions embody the physical conditions of supply for different types of products. 

Those factors:
- let us infer the shape of this aggregate supply. 
- give us a supply function of labour (or effort) which tells us <!-- inter alia --> at what point the employment function[2] for labour as a whole will cease to be elastic. 
<!-- ; — that is to say, the quantity of employment which will be devoted to production corresponding to any given level of effective demand measured in terms of wage-units.  -->

The marginal efficiency of capital curve depends:
- partly on the given factors 
- partly on the prospective yield of different kinds of capital-assets

The interest rate depends:
- partly on the state of the love for cash<!--  liquidity-preference (i.e. on the liquidity function) and --> 
- partly on the quantity of money measured in terms of hourly-common-wages. 


Thus our ultimate independent variables* are:

1. The 3 fundamental psychological factors which make up the propensity to consume
- the psychological propensity to consume
- the psychological attitude to liquidity
- the psychological expectation of future yield from capital-assets

2. The <!-- wage-unit --> hourly-common-wage as determined by the bargains reached between employers and employed -- this leads to the marginal efficiency of capital

3. The quantity of money as determined by the action of the central bank -- this leads to the interest rate


{{< n n="These roughly correspond to DCT of our DCTI model, with the national income as the remaining I" >}}



If we take as given the factors specified above, these variables determine the national income (or dividend) and the quantity of employment. 

<!-- But these again would be capable of being subjected to further analysis, and are not, so to speak, our ultimate atomic independent elements.  -->

<!-- The division of the determinants of the economic system into the two groups of -->

These given factors and independent variables are quite arbitrary. 

<!--  from any absolute standpoint.  -->

<!-- The division must be made entirely on the basis of experience, so as to correspond on the one hand to the factors in which the changes seem to be so slow or so little relevant as to have only a small and comparatively negligible short-term influence on our quaesitum; and on the other hand to those factors in which the changes are found in practice to exercise a dominant influence on our quaesitum.  -->

We want to discover what determines at any time the national income and the amount of its employment.

<!-- ; which means in a study so complex as economics, in which we cannot hope to make completely accurate generalisations, the factors whose changes mainly determine our quaesitum.  -->

Our final task might be to select those variables which can be deliberately controlled or managed by central authority. 


<!-- II  -->

Governments are induced to promote the rate new investments to force the supply-price of each type of capital-asset in order to <!-- a figure which, taken in conjunction with its prospective yield, to --> equalize the marginal efficiency of capital, with that of the interest rate. 

The rate of new investment is determined by:
- the physical supply in the capital-goods industries
- the state of confidence on the prospective yield
- the attitude to liquidity
- the quantity of money<!--  (preferably calculated in terms of wage-units) --> 


A change in the rate of investment will cause a change in the rate of consumption. This is because people only widen the gap between their income and consumption if their income is being increased. They narrow the gap if their income is decreased. 

Changes in the rate of consumption are, in general, in the same direction (though smaller in amount) as changes in the rate of income. 

The marginal propensity to consume gives the relation between the increment of consumption which accompanies a given increment of saving.

The investment multiplier gives the ratio between:
- an increment of investment and
- the corresponding increment of aggregate income, both measured in wage-units.

Finally, if we first assume <!-- (as a first approximation) --> that the employment multiplier is equal to the investment multiplier, we can infer the increment of employment by applying the multiplier to the increment <!-- (or decrement) --> in the rate of investment brought about by the factors first described. 

An increment <!-- (or decrement) --> of employment raises <!-- (or lower) --> the trend of the love for cash. 

This trend has 3 ways which will tend to increase the demand for money:
<!-- schedule of liquidity-preference; there being -->

1. The value of output will rise when employment increases even if the hourly-common-wage <!-- wage-unit --> and prices <!-- (in terms of the wage-unit) --> are unchanged
2. The <!-- wage-unit --> hourly-common-wage itself will tend to rise as employment improves, 
3. The increase in output will be accompanied by a rise of prices <!-- (in terms of the wage-unit) --> owing to increasing cost in the short period

Thus, the position of equilibrium will be influenced by these and other repercussions. 

All the above factors can substantially change without much warning. Hence, the extreme complexity* of the actual course of events.


{{< n n="We account for those complexities through our DCTI model" >}}


Nevertheless, these are the factors which are useful and convenient to isolate. 

<!-- If we examine any actual problem along the lines of the above schematism, we shall find it more manageable; and our practical intuition (which can take account of a more detailed complex of facts than can be treated on general principles) will be offered a less intractable material upon which to work.  -->
