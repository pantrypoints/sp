## Speciation Among Living Things and the Idea Attached to Speciation

<!-- It is not a futile pursuit firmly to establish the idea which we should form about what are called species among living creatures and to investigate whether it is true that species have an absolute constancy, are as old as nature, and have all existed originally just as we see them today, or whether, subject to changes which could have taken place in the circumstances relevant to them, they have not changed their characteristics and shape with the passage of time (although extremely slowly).

The illumination of this question is not only of interest to our zoological and botanical knowledge but also is essential to the history of the earth. -->

Each species is influenced by circumstances over a long period.
- This leads to habits which exert influences on the parts of each individual of the species

These habits modify these parts to make them appropriate to the acquired habits. 

A species is every collection of similar individuals produced by other individuals just like themselves.

<!-- This definition is exact, for every individual enjoying life always resembles very closely the one or those from which it came. But we add to this definition the assumption that  -->

We assume that:
- the individuals in a species never vary in their specific characteristics
- therefore the species has an absolute constancy in nature.

I contest this assumption.

People assume that:
- living things make up eternally distinct species because of their invariable characteristics
- the existence of these species is as ancient as nature herself

 <!-- was established at a time when people had not observed nature sufficiently and when the natural sciences were still almost nothing.  -->

The assumption is contradicted everyday by those who have followed nature for a long time.

 <!-- and who have reaped the benefits of the large and rich collections in our museum. -->

<!-- Moreover, all those who are very busy studying natural history know that nowadays  -->

Naturalists are extremely embarrassed in their attempts to define the objects which they have to consider species. 

<!-- In fact, not knowing that species have a constancy only relative to the duration of the circumstances in which all the individuals composing them are found and that some of these individuals, having undergone variations, make up races which modulate into some other neighbouring species, naturalists make decisions arbitrarily, by describing some individuals observed in different countries and in various environments as varieties and others as species. 

As a result, that section of work concerning the determination of species is becoming day by day increasingly defective, that is, more embarrassing and confusing.

In truth, it has been observed for a long time that there exist  -->


There are collections of individuals who:
- resemble each other in their organic structure and in the totality of their parts.
- remain in the same condition generation after generation

 <!-- for as long as we have known about them that people have believed themselves justified in regarding these collections of similar individuals as making up just as many invariable species. -->

The individuals of a species must perpetuate themselves without variation, as long as:
- the circumstances which influence their life do not essentially vary
- the existing prejudices agree with the successive regeneration of similar individuals

People have assumed that each species:
- did not vary
- was also as old as nature
- was uniquely created by the Supreme Author

<!-- There is no doubt that nothing exists except by the will of the sublime Author of everything. But can we assign some rules to Him in the execution of His will and establish the method which He followed in this matter? Could not His infinite power have been capable of creating an order of things which gave life successively to everything which we see, as well as to everything existing which we do not know about? -->

<!-- Whatever His will, the immensity of his power is still the same and whatever the manner in which the Supreme Will carried out His work, nothing can diminish His grandeur.

Therefore, respecting the decrees of this infinite wisdom, I confine myself within the limits of a simple observer of nature. Then, if I manage to unravel something of the progress which nature has followed to bring about its productions, I will say, without fear of being wrong, that it has pleased her Author that nature has had this faculty and this power. -->

The notion of species among living creatures which people formed was very simple.
- It seemed confirmed by the constancy in the apparent form of individuals which reproduction or generation perpetuated. 

Such individuals create for us a great number of those alleged species which we see every day.

<!-- However, the more we advance our knowledge of the different organic bodies which cover the surface of the earth almost everywhere, the greater becomes our embarrassment about determining what ought to be regarded as a species and, for even more compelling reasons, about limiting and distinguishing genera.

The more we collect the productions of nature and our collections grow richer, the more we see almost all the gaps being filled and our lines of separation being erased. 

We find ourselves reduced to an arbitrary determination, which sometimes leads us to seize upon the least differences among the varieties to form the characteristic of what we call species. Sometimes this makes us call certain individuals with slight differences a variety of some species. Other people consider these individuals constitute a separate species. -->

<!-- The more our collections increase, the more we encounter proofs that everything is nuanced, the remarkable differences disappear, and as often as not nature makes available to us for the creation of distinctions only minute and, so to speak, puerile particularities. -->

People create so many genera and species that the study and the definition of these species are now almost unworkable!

<!-- , among animals and plants, are so extensive in the quantity of species which people assign to them,   -->

<!-- They arrange the species in these genera ,  in a series and set beside each other according to an analysis of their natural affinities, display, along with those which are close to them, differences so slight that they are modifications of each other and these species get confused, in some way, amongst each other, leaving almost no way of determining in some explicit way the small differences which distinguish them. -->

<!-- Those who have concerned themselves long and diligently with the determination of species and who have looked at rich collections are the only ones who can know at what point, among living things, species merge into each other and who could convince themselves that, in those places where we see isolated species, the phenomenon occurs only because we are missing other closely related species which we have not yet collected. -->

I do not believe that animals form a very simple series, equally modified throughout. 

But I believe they form a branching series, with irregular gradations, something which has no discontinuity in its parts or which has not always had them, if it is true that as a result of some lost species such discontinuity occurs here and there. 

It follows that species which end each branch of this general series have other closely related species which meld into them. 

This well known state of things leads me now to provide an illustration.

<!-- I do not require any hypothesis nor any assumption for such a demonstration. I call all observing naturalists to vouch for its truth. -->

<!-- Not only many genera but some entire orders and sometimes even the classes already offer us almost complete sections of the state of things which I am going to point to. -->

I arrange the species in a series, placing them based on their natural affinities.

<!--  if you choose one and then, making a jump over several others, take another species a little distant, these two species, when compared, will present to you major differences between them. 

This was the manner in which we started to see nature's productions which we find most frequently within reach.  -->

Then the generic and specific distinctions were very easy to establish. 

But now that our collections are extremely profuse, if you follow the series which I have cited immediately above from the species you first chose right up to the one which you selected second (which is very different from the first), you will reach that second species through a series of slight modifications without having noticed distinctions worthy of attention.

What experimental zoologist or botanist has not explored this basis?

<!-- How then are we to study species or how are we able to determine them with a reliable method, among this multitude of polyps of all the orders, radiates, worms, and, above all, insects, where the individual order butterfly, Phalaena, Noctua, Tinea, flies, Ichneumon, Curculio, Cerambix, chafers, rose-chafers, and so on and so on already display so many closely related species, modifying into and almost overlapping each other? -->

What a crowd of shell creatures the mollusks show us from all countries and all seas, eluding our ways of distinguishing them and wearing out our resources on this question.

Go back up to the fish, reptiles, birds, even to mammals. 

You will see everywhere, apart from the gaps which still have to be filled, the modifications which link up neighbouring species, even genera, leaving hardly any places for our ingenuity to establish good distinctions.

And in its various parts does not botany, which focuses on the other series making up the plants, display exactly the same state of things?

What difficulties are not experienced nowadays in studying and determining species in the genera Lichen, Fucus, Carex, Poa, Piper, Euphorbia, Erica, Hieracium, Solanum, Geranium, Mimosa, and on and on?

When we formed these genera, we knew only a small number of their species; thus, they were easy to distinguish. But now that almost all the gaps between them have been filled, our specific differences are necessarily minute and very frequently insufficient.

What causes this?

The individuals of a species change their situation, climate, manner of life, or habits.
- These changes lead to influences which change gradually the constancy and the proportions of their parts, shape, faculties, even their organic structure.
- This leads to mutations

 <!-- with the result that everything in them participates, over time,  -->

In the same climate, significantly different situations and exposures induce changes in the individuals. 

But as time passes, those individuals reproduce successively.

The continual difference in the same circumstances leads to changes in them which become essential to their being.

After many generations, these individuals will be transformed into a new species.

<!-- , belonging originally to another species -->

For example, the seeds of a plant common to a humid prairie are transported by the wind to the slope of a neighbouring hill at a higher altitude.
- With each generation, it moves higher where it is more arid.
- These new conditions transform it into a new species.

 <!-- almost arid soil of the mountain slope and succeeds in subsisting there and perpetuates itself through a sequence of generations, it will then be so changed that botanists who come across it there will create a special species for it. -->

The same thing happens to animals which are forced to change their climate, manner of life, and habits.

But these require even more time compared to plants.
 <!-- in order to effect notable changes in the individuals. -->

People think that a species who have existed in the same form for a long time necessarily requires that its members cannot mate with those of another species.

<!-- a collection of similar individuals who perpetuate creatures like themselves through reproduction
 as long as nature  the individuals of the same species, in their reproductive acts, -->

Unfortunately, observation has demonstrated that this idea has no foundation. 

Hybrids are very well known among plants.

The matings between individuals of very different species among animals prove that the limits between these species, supposedly constant, were not constant.

Often nothing results from these odd matings, especially when they involve very different types.
- The offspring are generally infertile.*

{{< n n="This is why the Grays gradually lost the ability to reproduce -- because they rushed their evolution by getting specific traits" >}}

But when the disparity is less, the flaws do not occur.

This method by itself is sufficient to create varieties gradually which then become races, and which, in time, make up what we call species.
