In my 'Research Into Living Bodies (p. 50)' I laid down the following proposition:

{{< q a="Lamarck" >}}
It is not the organs, that is, the nature and the form of the animal's body parts, which cause habits and special faculties. In contrast, its habits, manner of life, and circumstances of the individuals from which the animal comes to possess, over time, the form of its body, the number and condition of its organs, and finally the faculties which it enjoys.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- Let people consider well this proposition and bring to it all the observations which nature and the state of things enable us to make all the time. Then its importance and reliability will become for us the most significant evidence. -->

Favourable times and circumstances are the 2 main means employed by nature to bring into existence all her productions. 

Time has no limits for her. She always has time to spare.

<!-- As to the circumstances which she needed and which she still uses every day to vary everything which she continues to produce, we can say that  -->

Circumstances for her are inexhaustible.

The main circumstances arise from the influence of:
- climates and various temperatures in the environment
- the variety of places and their exposure
- habits
- the most ordinary movements
- the most frequent actions
- the means of self-preservation, reproduction, etc


These various influences cause the faculties to expand and grow stronger through use. 

With new habits preserved over a long time they diversify. 

Imperceptibly the nature and the condition of the parts and the organs undergo the consequences of all these influences.

These preserve and propagate themselves in reproduction.

These truths are the consequences of the 2 natural laws above.

<!-- , are, in every case, amply confirmed by the facts. They indicate clearly the march of nature in the variety of her productions. -->

<!-- But instead of contenting ourselves with generalities which we could consider hypothetical, let us examine the facts directly. Let us consider in animals what is produced by the use or lack of use of their organs on these very organs, according to the habits which each race has been compelled to acquire. -->


The constant lack of exercise of an organ:
- reduces its faculties
- then it gradually shrinks it
- then it makes it disappear or even destroys it

<!-- If this lack of use continues for a long time in a sequence of successive generations of animals of the same race. -->

Then I will reveal how, by contrast, the habit of exercising an organ, in every animal which has not reached the limit in the diminution of its faculties, not only improves this organ's faculties and makes it grow, but also makes it develop and acquire dimensions which imperceptibly change it, so that in time it makes it quite different from the same organ examined in another animal which exercises it much less.

The lack of use of an organ, once it has become constant because of the habits which one has taken up, gradually diminishes that organ and ends up by making it disappear and even destroying it.

Similar vertebrate animals have much diversity in their parts.
- Yet all have their jaws equipped with teeth.

In animals that swallow instead of chew, their teeth have not undergone any development. 

They have either:
- remained hidden between the bony layers of the jaws without appearing on the outside or
- have even been destroyed


We thought that the whale entirely has no teeth.

Geoffroy has found them hidden in the jaws of the fetus of the animal. 

He has also located in birds the groove where the teeth were before.
- But we do not see them there any more.

<!-- Even in the class of mammals, which includes the most perfect animals, mainly those in which the design of the organic structure of vertebrates has been effected most completely, not only does the whale have no more teeth to use, but we also find there in the same class the ant eater (Myrmecophaga) in which the habit of not chewing has been introduced and preserved for a long time in the species. -->

Many vertebrates have eyes in the head.

 <!-- is characteristic of a large number of various animals and is an essential part of the design in the organic structure of . -->

Nevertheless, the mole which, through its habits, makes very little use of sight.
- It has only very small eyes.

<!-- , hardly apparent, because the animal makes use of this organ very rarely. -->

The aspalax of Olivier (Voyage in Egypt and in Persia, II, pl. 28, f. 2) lives underground like the mole.
- It exposes itself to daylight even less than the mole.
- It has completely lost the use of sight

<!-- Moreover, it manifests no more than vestiges of the organ which is the seat of sight. In addition, these vestiges are completely hidden under the skin and under some other parts which cover them over and do not provide any more the least access to light. -->

The Proteus is an aquatic reptile related by its affinities to the salamanders.
- They live in deep and dark cavities under the water, like the aspalax, has only vestiges of the organs of sight, vestiges which are covered and hidden in the same manner.

<!-- Here is a decisive consideration concerning the question which I am at present raising. -->

Light does not penetrate everywhere. 

Consequently, animals who live in the dark do not exercise their eyes.

<!-- Now, the animals which are part of a structural design in which the eyes are necessarily a part must have had them in their origins.  However, since we find among these animals ones which are without the use of this organ and which have only hidden and covered vestiges of it, it becomes evident that the -->

This makes the eyes shrink and even disappear.

 <!-- of the organ in question are the results, for this organ, of a constant lack of exercise. -->

Eyes disappear, reappear, and disappear again as a result of the possibility or the impossibility of the animal's making use of it.

In the acephalid mollusks, the great development of the mantle has made their eyes and even their head entirely useless through a constant lack of use.
