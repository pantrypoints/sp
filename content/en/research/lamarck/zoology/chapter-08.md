 <!-- and the structure we must give to their general distribution so that it conforms to the very order of nature. -->
 
Chapter 5 said that the essential aim of a distribution of animals must not limit itself to the possession of a list of classes, genera, and species. 

This distribution must display the means most favorable to the study of nature.

<!-- , something which is most relevant to make us understand her progress, her means, and her laws. -->

However, our general distributions of animals today have a structure which reverses the very order nature.

 <!-- followed in giving rise successively to her living productions.  -->

It moves from the most complex towards the most simple.
- This makes the learning of the composition of organic structure more difficult to grasp.

We perceive less easily:
- the causes of this progress
- the interruptions in it

When we realize that something is useful, we hurriedly make use of it, even though it is contrary to custom.

<!-- , even that it is indispensable for the goal we propose and that there is nothing inconvenient about it,  -->

<!-- Such is the case concerning the structure which we must give to the general disposition of animals. -->

<!-- It is not at all an indifferent matter to begin this general distribution of animals at either one of its extremities and that what should come at the start of the order cannot be simply a matter of our choice. -->

The current custom is to put:
- at the head of the animal kingdom the most perfect animals
- at the end the least perfect and simplest

This is from our tendency to give precedence to the objects which we find striking, pleasing, or interesting.
- We have preferred to move from the best known towards the least known.


<!-- At the time when people began to occupy themselves with the study of natural history,  -->

These considerations were very persuasive.

But they should yield now to scientific needs, particularly to the need to facilitate our progress in the understanding of nature.

<!-- With respect to animals which nature has succeeded in producing, so numerous and so varied, if we cannot boast of knowing exactly the true order which nature followed in bringing them successively into existence, what I am going to reveal is probably very close to that order. 

Reason and all the knowledge we have acquired encourage this probability.

In fact, if it is true that all living bodies are productions of nature, we cannot refuse to believe that she could produce them only successively, not all at once at a specific moment. Now, if she created them one after the other, there is reason to believe that she began  -->

Nature began exclusively with the simplest structures.

 <!-- and did not produce the most complex organic structures (in both the animal and plant kingdoms) until the end, -->

Botanists first gave zoologists the example of the true order of nature. 

<!-- arrangement of the general distribution in order to represent the very -->

They formed the first class of plants with the acotyledonous or agamous plants.

These:
- are the structurally simplest, most imperfect plants
- had no cotyledons, no determinable sex, no vessels in their tissues, plants which are composed only of cellular tissue more or less modified according to different extensions

What the botanists have done with plants, we should do with animals.

 <!-- kingdom, not only because nature herself points in that direction and reason demands it, but also -->

This is because the natural order of classes is determined by the growing complexity in organic structure.
- This is much easier to see among animals than in plants.

This order of nature will:
- make the study of objects much easier
- improve our understanding of:
  - the organic structure of animals
  - the progress in its complexity from class to class
- will demonstrate better the affinities between the different degrees of animal organization and the external difference used to characterize the classes, orders, families, genera, and species

<!-- (whose basis one cannot seriously call into question) -->

Nature would make only either create only one race in each organic order or one race for the simplest animals and plants if nature:
- could not make organic structures last forever
- could not give these bodies the capacity of reproducing 

<!-- themselves with other individuals which resembled them, replaced them, and perpetuate the race by the same means, she would have been forced to create directly all the races or rather she would have been able to create ,  -->


<!-- In addition, if nature had not been capable of the active processes of organization with the ability to make that very organic structure more and more complex, by increasing the mobile energy of fluid movement and thus organic movement, and if she had not preserved through reproduction all the progress in the composition of organic structures and all the acquired improvements, she should assuredly never have produced this multitude of infinitely varied animals and plants, so different from each other in the condition of their organic structures and capacities.

Finally, she would not have been able to create right at the first the most eminent animal faculties, for they do not arise except with the help of very complex organic systems. Nature had to prepare gradually the means of bringing into existence such organic systems.

Thus, to establish, with respect to living bodies, the state of things which we observe, -->


Thus, the only thing nature had to produce directly without the combination of any organic action was the simplest organic bodies.

 <!-- whether animals or plants. -->

 <!-- And she still reproduces these in the same way, every day, in favorable places and seasons.  -->

Nature gave these bodies which she herself created the capacity to:
- feed themselves and grow
- preserve the improvements they acquired
- multiply and pass on these same capacities through reproduction over time

<!-- in their organic structure and, finally, by  -->

<!-- given the enormous diversity of always changing circumstances, the living bodies of all the classes and every order were, through  -->

This allowed those bodies to produce diversity, one after the other.

<!-- In considering the natural order of animals, the very marked gradation which exists in the growing complexity of their organic structure and the number as well as the improvement of their faculties is far from being a new truth.

Even the Greeks were able to perceive it (1).

But they were not able to lay bare the principles and proofs, because people then lacked the knowledge necessary to establish them.
 -->

<!-- Now, in order to facilitate the knowledge of the principles which have guided me in the exposition which I am about to make concerning this order of animals, and to better render perceptible this gradation which we observe in the complexity of their organic structure, from the most imperfect among them, who are at the head of the series, right up to the most perfect which conclude the series,  -->
