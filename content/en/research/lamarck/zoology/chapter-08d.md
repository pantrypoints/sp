<!-- POLYPS
(Second Class of the Animal Kingdom) -->


## Stage 2

These are gemmiparous animals:
- with gelatinous regenerating bodies
- without any interior organ except an alimentary canal with a single opening.  
- with terminal mouth surrounded by radiating tentacles with ciliated or rotatory organs.  

The majority adhere to each other, communicate together by their alimentary canal, and thus form composite animals.


### Observations

<!-- We saw in the infusorians infinitely small, frail animalcules without consistency, without a shape unique to their class, without any organs at all, and consequently without a mouth and a distinct alimentary canal. -->

<!-- In the polyps, the simplicity and imperfection of the organic structure, although still very noticeable, are less great than in the infusorians.  -->

The organic structure of polyps are more advanced than infusorians. 


They already have:
- a consistently regular form
- a special organ for digestion, and consequently with a mouth, the entry to their alimentary sack.


The polyp has a small elongated body, gelatinous, very irritable.

It has at its upper extremity a mouth with either rotatory organs or radiating tentacles
- These serve as the entry point to an alimentary canal which has no other opening 

These can adhere and live together in a common life.

 <!-- we will understand the most general and the most remarkable fact concerning these animals. -->

They do not have nerves for feeling, nor special organs for respiration, nor vessels for the circulation of their fluids.

<!-- They are the more imperfect in their organic structure than the animals which are going to follow. -->


## Polyp Orders

1. Rotifer Polyps -- They have around their mouths ciliated and rotatory organs
2. Polyps in Polyparies -- They have around their mouths radiating tentacles and are fixed in a polypary which does not float on the oceans.
  - 2a -- Membranous or Horny polypary, without a distinct outer crust
  - 2b -- Polypary with a horny axis, covered with a crust
  - 2c -- Polypary with an axis and partly or entirely stony, and covered over with a bark like crust
  - 2d -- Polypary entirely stony without a crust
3. Floating Polyps -- A polypary free, elongated, floating in water, and having a horny or bony axis covered with a skin common to all the polyps; radiating tentacles around the mouth
4. Naked Polyps -- They have radiating often multiple tentacles at their mouths; they do not form polyparies.
5. Rotifer Polyps -- They have around their mouths ciliated and rotatory organs
