These are oviparous animals with articulated limbs and eyes in the head.

They:
- do not undergo a metamorphosis and never possess wings or elytra
- have stigmata and limited trachaea for respiration
- have a rudimentary circulation system
- have several fertilizations in a lifetime


## Observations

The arachnids, which in the order which we have established come after the insects, show clear progress in the perfecting of organic structure.

Sexual reproduction manifests itself with the arachnids, for the first time, with all its capabilities, since these animals couple and reproduce several times in their lives, 

In the insects, the sexual organs, like those of plants, can only carry out a single fertilization. 

The arachnids are the first animals in which the circulation system begins to become sketched out. 

Cuvier writes that they have a heart extending from which, on the sides, are two or three pairs of vessels.

The arachnids:
- live in the air, like those insects which have reached the perfect condition
- do not undergo any metamorphosis
- never have wings and elytra, something which is not the result of some abortion
- remain hidden or living by themselves, feeding on prey or by sucking blood.

In the arachnids, the method of respiration is still the same as in the insects.

But the method is on the point of changing. 

The trachaea of arachnids:
- are very limited (impoverished) 
- do not extend to all the parts of the body

Cuvier writes that these trachaea have been reduced to a few vesicles.

After the arachnids, this method of respiration does not occur again in any of the classes of animals which follow.

This class of animals needs to treated with care. Many of them are venemous, especially those which live in hot climates.
