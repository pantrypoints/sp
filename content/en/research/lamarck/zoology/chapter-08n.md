Viviparous animals, with vertebra and cold blood; breathing incompletely by a lung, at least in their later life; with a smooth skin or one covered in scales or a bony shell.

Observations

In the reptiles some progress in the perfectioning of organic structures is very noticeable, if we compare these animals with the fish.  For among them we find for the first time the lung, which we know is the most perfect respiratory organ, because it is the same as what is in man.  But here it is only sketchy, and several reptiles do not even have one in the early part of their lives.  In truth, they breathe only incompletely, for only a part of the blood is sent to the parts which go by the lung.

It is also among them that we see for the first time in a distinct way four limbs which are part of the design of vertebrate animals and which are appendages of (or depend upon) the skeleton.
