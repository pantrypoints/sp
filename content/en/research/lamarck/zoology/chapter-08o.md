SIXTH DEGREE OF ORGANIC STRUCTURE

Nerves ending at a spinal chord and a brain which fills the cranial case; heart with two ventricles and warm blood.

[Birds and Mammals]



(Thirteenth Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals, vertebrates and with warm blood; breathing completely by adhering and pierced lungs; four articulated limbs, two of which are shaped as wings; feathers on the skin.

Observations

The birds certainly have an organic structure more perfect than the reptiles and all the animals of the preceding classes, because they have warm blood, a heart with two ventricles, and their brain fills the cranial case, characteristics which they share only with the more perfect animals which make up the last class.

However, birds evidently form only the penultimate rung of the animal ladder, for they are less perfect than the mammals, since they are still oviparous, lack mammary glands, lack a diaphragm, a bladder, and so on, and since they have fewer faculties.

In the table which follows, one can notice that the four first orders include the birds whose young cannot walk or feed themselves when they hatch and, by contrast,  the three last orders include the birds whose young move and feed themselves as soon as they emerge from the egg.  Finally, the seventh order, that of the palimpeds, seems to me to show birds who, through their affinities, come closest to the animals of the class which follows.
