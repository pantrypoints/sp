2. It would appear as though Newton in the re- marks here cited still stood under the influence of the mediæval philosophy, as though he had grown unfaith- ful to his resolve to investigate only actual facts.  -->

When we say a thing A changes with the time, we mean simply that the conditions that determine a thing `A` depend on the conditions that determine another thing `B`. 

The vibrations of a pendulum take place in time when its excursion depends on the position of the earth. 

Since, however, in the observation of the pendulum, we do not take into account its dependence on the position of the earth, but may compare it with any other thing (the conditions of which of course also depend on the position of the earth), the illusory notion easily arises that all the things with which we compare it are unessential. 

Nay, we may, in attending to the motion of a pendulum, neglect en- tirely other external things, and find that for every po- sition of it our thoughts and sensations are different. 

Time, accordingly, appears to be some particular and independent thing, on the progress of which the position of the pendulum depends, while the things that we resort to for comparison and choose at random appear to play a wholly collateral part.


224


But we must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another, and that nature of we ourselves and all our thoughts are also a part of It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time.

Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the changes of things; made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure, all being interconnected. 

A motion is termed uniform in which equal increments space described correspond to equal increments of space described by some motion with which we form a comparison, as the rotation of the earth. A motion may, with respect to another motion, be uniform. But the question whether a motion is in itself uniform, is senseless. With just as little justice, also, may we speak of an "absolute time "of a time independent of change. This absolute time can be measured by com- parison with no motion; it has therefore neither a practical nor a scientific value; and no one is justified in saying that he knows aught about it. It is an idle metaphysical conception.

It would not be difficult to show from the points of view of psychology, history, and the science of lan- guage (by the names of the chronological divisions), that we reach our ideas of time in and through the in- terdependence of things on one another. In these ideas the profoundest and most universal connection of things is expressed. When a motion takes place in time, it depends on the motion of the earth. This is not refuted by the fact that mechanical motions can be reversed. A number of variable quantities may be so related that one set can suffer a change without the others being affected by it. Nature behaves like a machine. 

<!-- 225 -->

The individual parts reciprocally determine one another. But while in a machine the position of one part de- termines the position of all the other parts, in nature more complicated relations obtain. 

These relations are best represented under the conception of a number, n, of quantities that satisfy a lesser number, n', of equa- tions. Were nn', nature would be invariable. Were n'n — 1, then with one quantity all the rest would be controlled. If this latter relation obtained in na- ture, time could be reversed the moment this had been accomplished with any one single motion. But the true state of things is represented by a different rela- tion between n and n'. 

The quantities in question are partially determined by one another; but they retain a greater indeterminateness, or freedom, than in the case last cited. We ourselves feel that we are such a partially determined, partially undetermined element of nature. In so far as a portion only of the changes of nature depends on us and can be reversed by us, does time appear to us irreversible, and the time that is past as irrevocably gone.


We arrive at the idea of time,-to express it briefly and popularly,-by the connection of that which is contained in the province of our memory with that which is contained in the province of our sense-perception.

When we say that time flows on in a definite di- rection or sense, we mean that physical events gene- rally (and therefore also physiological events) take place only in a definite sense.* Differences of tem- perature, electrical differences, differences of level gen- erally, if left to themselves, all grow less and not greater. 

226

If we contemplate two bodies of different temperatures, put in contact and left wholly to them- selves, we shall find that it is possible only for greater differences of temperature in the field of memory to exist with lesser ones in the field of sense-perception, and not the reverse. In all this there is simply ex- pressed a peculiar and profound connection of things. To demand at the present time a full elucidation of this matter, is to anticipate, in the manner of speculative philosophy, the results of all future special investiga- tion, that is a perfect physical science. (Compare Ap- pendix, XIX., p. 541.)


3. Views similar to those concerning time, are de- veloped by Newton with respect to space and motion. We extract here a few passages which characterise his position.

"II. Absolute space, in its own nature and with- "out regard to anything external, always remains sim- "ilar and immovable.
"Relative space is some movable dimension or "measure of absolute space, which our senses deter- "mine by its position with respect to other bodies, "and which is commonly taken for immovable [abso- lute] space....
"IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body "from one absolute place* to another absolute place; "and relative motion, the translation from one relative 'place to another relative place....
".... And thus we use, in common affairs, instead "of absolute places and motions, relative ones; and "that without any inconvenience. But in physical disquisitions, we should abstract from the senses. "For it may be that there is no body really at rest, to "which the places and motions of others can be re- "ferred....
"The effects by which absolute and relative motions

4. Newton has again acted contrary to his expressed intention only to investigate actual facts.

No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space and absolute motion; they are pure things of thought, pure mental constructs, that cannot be produced in experience. 

All our principles of me- chanics are, as we have shown in detail, experimental knowledge concerning the relative positions and mo- tions of bodies. Even in the provinces in which they are now recognised as valid, they could not, and were not, admitted without previously being subjected to experimental tests. No one is warranted in extending these principles beyond the boundaries of experience. In fact, such an extension is meaningless, as no one possesses the requisite knowledge to make use of it.

Let us look at the matter in detail. When we say that a body K alters its direction and velocity solely through the influence of another body K', we have asserted a conception that it is impossible to come at unless other bodies A, B, C... . are present with reference to which the motion of the body K has been estimated. In reality, therefore, we are simply cognisant of a relation of the body K to A, B, C.... 

If now we sud- denly neglect A, B, C.... and attempt to speak of the deportment of the body K in absolute space, we implicate ourselves in a twofold error. In the first place, we cannot know how K would act in the ab- sence of A, B, C... .; 

230

in the second place, every means would be wanting of forming a judgment of the behaviour of K and of putting to the test what we had predicated,-which latter therefore would be bereft of all scientific significance.

Two bodies K and K', which gravitate toward each other, impart to each other in the direction of their line of junction accelerations inversely proportional to their masses m, m'. 

In this proposition is contained, not only a relation of the bodies K and K' to one an- other, but also a relation of them to other bodies. For the proposition asserts, not only that K and K' suffer with respect to one another the acceleration designated by u (m + m' /r2), but also that K experiences the acceleration -xm' /r2 and K' the acceleration + um/r2 in the direction of the line of junction; facts which can be ascertained only by the presence of other bodies.


The motion of a body K can only be estimated by reference to other bodies A, B, C.... But since we always have at our disposal a sufficient number of bodies, that are as respects each other relatively fixed, or only slowly change their positions, we are, in such reference, restricted to no one definite body and can alternately leave out of account now this one and now that one.

In this way the conviction arose that these bodies are indifferent generally.

It might be, indeed, that the isolated bodies A, B, C. ... play merely a collateral rôle in the determina- tion of the motion of the body K, and that this motion is determined by a medium in which K exists. 


231

In such a case we should have to substitute this medium for Newton's absolute space. Newton certainly did not entertain this idea. Moreover, it is easily demonstrable that the atmosphere is not this motion-determinative medium. We should, therefore, have to picture to ourselves some other medium, filling, say, all space, with respect to the constitution of which and its kinetic relations to the bodies placed in it we have at present no adequate knowledge. In itself such a state of things would not belong to the impossibilities. 


Recent hydrodynamical investigations have shown that a rigid body experiences resistance in a frictionless fluid only when its velocity changes. True, this result is derived theoretically from the notion of inertia; but it might, conversely, also be regarded as the primitive fact from which we have to start. Although, practically, and at present, nothing is to be accomplished with this con- ception, we might still hope to learn more in the future concerning this hypothetical medium; and from the point of view of science it would be in every respect a more valuable acquisition than the forlorn idea of absolute space. When we reflect that we cannot abol- ish the isolated bodies A, B, C... ., that is, cannot determine by experiment whether the part they play is fundamental or collateral, that hitherto they have been the sole and only competent means of the orientation of motions and of the description of mechanical facts, it will be found expedient provisionally to regard all motions as determined by these bodies.

5. Let us now examine the point on which New-c ton, apparently with sound reasons, rests his distinc- tion of absolute and relative motion. If the earth is a affected with an absolute rotation about its axis, cen- trifugal forces are set up in the earth it assumes an oblate form, the acceleration of gravity is diminished at the equator, the plane of Foucault's pendulum ro- tates, and so on. All these phenomena disappear if the earth is at rest and the other heavenly bodies are affected with absolute motion round it, such that the same relative rotation is produced. This is, indeed, the case, if we start ab initio from the idea of absolute space.

<!-- 232 -->


But if we take our stand on the basis of facts, we shall find we have knowledge only of relative spaces and mo- tions. Relatively, not considering the unknown and neglected medium of space, the motions of the uni- verse are the same whether we adopt the Ptolemaic or the Copernican mode of view. Both views are, indeed, equally correct; only the latter is more simple and more practical. The universe is not twice given, with an earth at rest and an earth in motion; but only once, with its relative motions, alone determinable. 

It is, accordingly, not permitted us to say how things would be if the earth did not rotate. We may interpret the one case that is given us, in different ways. If, however, we so interpret it that we come into conflict with experience, our interpretation is simply wrong. The principles of mechanics can, indeed, be so conceived, that even for relative rotations centrifugal forces arise.

Newton's experiment with the rotating vessel of water simply informs us, that the relative rotation of the water with respect to the sides of the vessel produces no noticeable centrifugal forces, but that such forces are produced by its relative rotation with respect to the mass of the earth and the other celestial bodies. No one is competent to say how the experiment would turn out if the sides of the vessel increased in thickness and mass till they were ultimately several leagues thick. The one experiment only lies before us, and our busi- ness is, to bring it into accord with the other facts known to us, and not with the arbitrary fictions of our imagination.


<!-- 233 -->

6. We can have no doubts concerning the signifi- cance of the law of inertia if we bear in mind the man- ner in which it was reached. To begin with, Galileo discovered the constancy of the velocity and direction of a body referred to terrestrial objects.

Most terrestrial motions are of such brief duration and extent, that it is wholly unnecessary to take into account the earth's rotation and the changes of its progressive velocity with respect to the celestial bodies. 

This consideration is found necessary only in the case of projectiles cast great distances, in the case of the vibrations of Fou- cault's pendulum, and in similar instances. When now Newton sought to apply the mechanical principles dis- covered since Galileo's time to the planetary system, he found that, so far as it is possible to form any es- timate at all thereof, the planets, irrespectively of dy- namic effects, appear to preserve their direction and velocity with respect to bodies of the universe that are very remote and as regards each other apparently fixed, the same as bodies moving on the earth do with re- spect to the fixed objects of the earth. 

The comportment of terrestrial bodies with respect to the earth is reducible to the comportment of the earth with respect to the remote heavenly bodies. If we were to assert that we knew more of moving objects than this their last-mentioned, experimentally-given comportment with respect to the celestial bodies, we should render ourselves culpable of a falsity. 

When, accordingly, we say, that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity in space, our assertion is nothing more or less than- an abbreviated reference to the entire universe. 

The use of such an abbreviated expression is permit- ted the original author of the principle, because he knows, that as things are no difficulties stand in the way of carrying out its implied directions. But no remedy lies in his power, if difficulties of the kind men- tioned present themselves; if, for example, the re- quisite, relatively fixed bodies are wanting.

<!-- 234 -->

7. Instead, now, of referring a moving body K to space, that is to say to a system of coördinates, let us view directly its relation to the bodies of the universe, by which alone such a system of coördinates can be determined. Bodies very remote from each other, mov- ing with constant direction and velocity with respect to other distant fixed bodies, change their mutual distances proportionately to the time. We may also say, All very remote bodies-all mutual or other forces ne- glected-alter their mutual distances proportionately to those distances. 

Two bodies, which, situated at a short distance from one another, move with constant direction and velocity with respect to other fixed bod- ies, exhibit more complicated relations. If we should regard the two bodies as dependent on one another, and call the distance, t the time, and a a constant dependent on the directions and velocities, the formula would be obtained: der/dt = (1/r) [a2 — (dr/dt)2]. It is manifestly much simpler and clearer to regard the two bodies as independent of each other and to con- sider the constancy of their direction and velocity with respect to other bodies.

Instead of saying, the direction and velocity of a mass μ in space remain constant, we may also employ the expression, the mean acceleration of the mass μ with respect to the masses m, m', m". . . . at the dis- tances r, r', qu''.. is 0, or d2(mr/Zm)/dt2. = 0. The latter expression is equivalent to the former, as soon as we take into consideration a sufficient number of sufficiently distant and sufficiently large masses. The mutual influence of more proximate small masses, which are apparently not concerned about each other, is eliminated of itself. That the constancy of direction and velocity is given by the condition adduced, will be


<!-- 235 -->


seen at once if we construct through μ as vertex cones that cut out different portions of space, and set up the condition with respect to the masses of these separate portions. 

We may put, indeed, for the entire space encompassing μ, d2 (Emr/Zm) /d t2 = 0. But the equation in this case asserts nothing with respect to the motion of μ, since it holds good for all species of mo- tion where μ is uniformly surrounded by an infinite number of masses. If two masses μ1, M2 exert on each other a force which is dependent on their distance r, then der/dt2 (μ2+μ2)f(r). But, at the same time, the acceleration of the centre of gravity of the two masses or the mean acceleration of the mass-system with respect to the masses of the universe (by the prin- ciple of reaction) remains = 0; that is to say,

<!-- -
d2
Emr.
Zmr2 = 0. -->

When we reflect that the time-factor that enters into the acceleration is nothing more than a quantity that is the measure of the distances (or angles of rota- tion) of the bodies of the universe, we see that even in the simplest case, in which apparently we deal with the mutual action of only two masses, the neglecting of the rest of the world is impossible. Nature does not begin with elements, as we are obliged to begin with them. It is certainly fortunate for us, that we can, from time to time, turn aside our eyes from the over- powering unity of the All, and allow them to rest on individual details. But we should not omit, ultimately to complete and correct our views by a thorough con- sideration of the things which for the time being we left out of account.



<!-- 236 -->


8. The considerations just presented show, that it is not necessary to refer the law of inertia to a special absolute space. 

On the contrary, it is perceived that the masses that in the common phraseology exert forces on each other as well as those that exert none, stand with respect to acceleration in quite similar relations. We may, indeed, regard all masses as related to each other. That accelerations play a prominent part in the relations of the masses, must be accepted as a fact of experience; which does not, however, exclude attempts to elucidate this fact by a comparison of it with other facts, involving the discovery of new points of view. In all the processes of nature the differences of certain these differences.

quantities u play a de- terminative rôle. Differ- ences of temperature, of potential function, and so forth, induce the natural processes, which consist in the equalisation of The familiar expressions d2u/dx2, d2u/dy2, d2u/dz2, which are determinative of the character of the equalisation, may be regarded as the measure of the departure of the condition of any point from the mean of the conditions of its environment— to which mean the point tends. The accelerations of masses may be analogously conceived. The great dis- tances between masses that stand in no especial force- relation to one another, change proportionately to each other. If we lay off, therefore, a certain distance p as abscissa, and another as ordinate, we obtain a straight line. (Fig. 143.) Every r-ordinate corresponding to a definite p-value represents, accordingly, the mean of the adjacent ordinates. 


<!-- 237 -->


If a force-relation exists be- tween the bodies, some value der/dt is determined by it which conformably to the remarks above we may replace by an expression of the form der/dp2. By the force-relation, therefore, a departure of the r-ordinate from the mean of the adjacent ordinates is produced, which would not exist if the supposed force-relation did not obtain. This intimation will suffice here.

9. We have attempted in the foregoing to give the  ́law of inertia a different expression from that in ordi- nary use. This expression will, so long as a suffi- cient number of bodies are apparently fixed in space, accomplish the same as the ordinary one. 

It is as easily applied, and it encounters the same difficulties. In the one case we are unable to come at an absolute space, in the other a limited number of masses only is within the reach of our knowledge, and the summation indicated can consequently not be fully carried out. It is impossible to say whether the new expression would still represent the true condition of things if the stars were to perform rapid movements among one another. The general experience cannot be constructed from the particular case given us. We must, on the contrary, wait until such an experience presents itself. Perhaps when our physico-astronomical knowledge has been extended, it will be offered somewhere in celestial space, where more violent and complicated motions take place than in our environment. The most impor-- tant result of our reflexions is, however, that precisely the apparently simplest mechanical principles are of a very complicated character, that these principles are founded on uncompleted experiences, nay on experiences that never can be fully completed, that practically, indeed, they are suf- ficiently secured, in view of the tolerable stability of our environment, to serve as the foundation of mathematical deduction, but that they can by no means themselves be regarded as mathematically established truths but only as principles that not only admit of constant control by expe- rience but actually require it. This perception is valu- able in that it is propitious to the advancement of science. (Compare Appendix, XX., p. 542.)

VII. SYNOPTICAL CRITIQUE OF THE NEWTONIAN ENUNCIATIONS

1. Now that we have discussed the details with sufficient particularity, we may pass again under re- view the form and the disposition of the Newtonian enunciations. Newton premises to his work several definitions, following which he gives the laws of mo- tion. We shall take up the former first.


Definition I. 

The quantity of any matter is the "measure of it by its density and volume conjointly. This quantity is what I shall understand by the "term mass or body in the discussions to follow. It is "ascertainable from the weight of the body in ques- "tion. For I have found, by pendulum-experiments "of high precision, that the mass of a body is propor- "tional to its weight; as will hereafter be shown.

"Definition II. Quantity of motion is the measure "of it by the velocity and quantity of matter con- 'jointly.

"Definition III. The resident force [vis insita, i. e. "the inertia] of matter is a power of resisting, by "which every body, so far as in it lies, perseveres in "its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.

Definition IV. An impressed force is any action "upon a body which changes, or tends to change, its "state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line.


241 


2. Definition I is, as has already been set forth, a pseudo-definition. The concept of mass is not made clearer by describing mass as the product of the volume into the density, as density itself denotes simply the mass of unit of volume. The true definition of mass can be deduced only from the dynamical relations of bodies.
To Definition II, which simply enunciates a mode of computation, no objection is to be made. Defini- tion (inertia), however, is rendered superfluous by Definitions IV-VIII of force, inertia being included and given in the fact that forces are accelerative.
Definition IV defines force as the cause of the accel- eration, or tendency to acceleration, of a body. The latter part of this is justified by the fact that in the cases also in which accelerations cannot take place, other attractions that answer thereto, as the compres- sion and distension etc. of bodies occur. The cause of an acceleration towards a definite centre is defined in Definition v as centripetal force, and is distinguished in VI, VII, and VIII as absolute, accelerative, and mo- tive. It is, we may say, a matter of taste and of form whether we shall embody the explication of the idea of force in one or in several definitions. In point of principle the Newtonian definitions are open to no ob- jections.
3. The Axioms or Laws of Motion then follow, of which Newton enunciates three:
"Law I. Every body perseveres in its state of rest "or of uniform motion in a straight line, except in so "far as it is compelled to change that state by im- "pressed forces."
"Law II. Change of motion [i. e. of momentum] is "proportional to the moving force impressed, and takes
