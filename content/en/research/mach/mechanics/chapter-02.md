seen at once if we construct through μ as vertex cones that cut out different portions of space, and set up the condition with respect to the masses of these separate portions. We may put, indeed, for the entire space encompassing μ, d2 (Emr/Zm) /d t2 = 0. But the
equation in this case asserts nothing with respect to the motion of μ, since it holds good for all species of mo- tion where μ is uniformly surrounded by an infinite number of masses. If two masses μ1, M2 exert on each other a force which is dependent on their distance r, then der/dt2 (μ2+μ2)f(r). But, at the same time, the acceleration of the centre of gravity of the two masses or the mean acceleration of the mass-system with respect to the masses of the universe (by the prin- ciple of reaction) remains = 0; that is to say,

When we reflect that the time-factor that enters into the acceleration is nothing more than a quantity that is the measure of the distances (or angles of rota- tion) of the bodies of the universe, we see that even in the simplest case, in which apparently we deal with the mutual action of only two masses, the neglecting of the rest of the world is impossible. Nature does not begin with elements, as we are obliged to begin with them. It is certainly fortunate for us, that we can, from time to time, turn aside our eyes from the over- powering unity of the All, and allow them to rest on individual details. But we should not omit, ultimately to complete and correct our views by a thorough con- sideration of the things which for the time being we left out of account.
8. The considerations just presented show, that it

is not necessary to refer the law of inertia to a special absolute space. On the contrary, it is perceived that the masses that in the common phraseology exert forces on each other as well as those that exert none, stand with respect to acceleration in quite similar relations. We may, indeed, regard all masses as related to each other. That accelerations play a prominent part in the relations of the masses, must be accepted as a fact of experience; which does not, however, exclude attempts to elucidate this fact by a comparison of it with other facts, involving the discovery of new points of view. In all the processes of nature the differences of certain

quantities u play a de- terminative rôle. Differ- ences of temperature, of potential function, and so forth, induce the natural
processes, which consist in the equalisation of The familiar expressions d2u/dx2, d2u/dy2, d2u/dz2, which are determinative of the character of the equalisation, may be regarded as the measure of the departure of the condition of any point from the mean of the conditions of its environment— to which mean the point tends. The accelerations of masses may be analogously conceived. The great dis- tances between masses that stand in no especial force- relation to one another, change proportionately to each other. If we lay off, therefore, a certain distance p as abscissa, and another as ordinate, we obtain a straight line. (Fig. 143.) Every r-ordinate corresponding to a definite p-value represents, accordingly, the mean of the adjacent ordinates. If a force-relation exists be- tween the bodies, some value der/dt is determined

by it which conformably to the remarks above we may replace by an expression of the form der/dp2. By the force-relation, therefore, a departure of the r-ordinate from the mean of the adjacent ordinates is produced, which would not exist if the supposed force-relation did not obtain. This intimation will suffice here.

9. We have attempted in the foregoing to give the  ́law of inertia a different expression from that in ordi- nary use. This expression will, so long as a suffi- cient number of bodies are apparently fixed in space, accomplish the same as the ordinary one. It is as easily applied, and it encounters the same difficulties. In the one case we are unable to come at an absolute space, in the other a limited number of masses only is within the reach of our knowledge, and the summation indicated can consequently not be fully carried out. It is impossible to say whether the new expression would still represent the true condition of things if the stars were to perform rapid movements among one another. The general experience cannot be constructed from the particular case given us. We must, on the contrary, wait until such an experience presents itself. Perhaps when our physico-astronomical knowledge has been extended, it will be offered somewhere in celestial space, where more violent and complicated motions take place than in our environment. The most impor-- tant result of our reflexions is, however, that precisely the apparently simplest mechanical principles are of a very complicated character, that these principles are founded on uncompleted experiences, nay on experiences that never can be fully completed, that practically, indeed, they are suf- ficiently secured, in view of the tolerable stability of our environment, to serve as the foundation of mathematical deduction, but that they can by no means themselves be re-



<!-- No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space and absolute motion; they are pure things of thought, pure mental constructs, that cannot be produced in experience. All our principles of mechanics are... experimental knowledge concerning the relative positions and motions of bodies. ...No one is warranted in extending these principles beyond the boundaries of experience. ...[S]uch an extension is meaningless, as no one possesses the requisite knowledge to make use of it. -->
