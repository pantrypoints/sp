The Party committee system is an important Party institution for:
- ensuring collective leadership
- preventing any individual from monopolizing the conduct of affairs. 

In some leading bodies, one individual usually monopolizes the conduct of affairs and decide important problems.

Solutions to important problems are decided not by Party committee meetings but by one individual, and membership in the Party committee has become nominal. 

Differences of opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left unresolved for a long time. Members of the Party committee maintain only formal, not real, unity among themselves. This situation must be changed. 

From now on, a sound system of Party committee meetings must be instituted in all leading bodies:
- from the regional bureaus of the Central Committee to the prefectural Party committees
- from the Party committees of the fronts to:
  - the Party committees of brigades and military areas (sub-commissions of the Revolutionary Military Commission or leading groups)
  - the leading Party members' groups in government bodies
  - people's organizations the news agency and the newspaper offices. 

All important problems (of course, not the unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose solutions have already been decided after discussion at meetings and need only be carried out) must be submitted to the committee for discussion, and the committee members present should express their views fully and reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by the members concerned… 

Party committee meetings must be divided into 2 categories:

1. standing committee meetings
2. plenary sessions

The two should not be confused. 

Either collective leadership or personal responsibility should not be overemphasized to the neglect of the other. 

In the army, the person in command has the right to make emergency decisions during battle and when circumstances require.

The secretary of a Party committee must be good at being a "squad leader". AParty committee has ten to twenty members; it is like a squad in the army, and the secretary is like the "squad leader". 

It is not easy to lead this squad well. Each regional bureau or sub-regional bureau of the Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders very heavy responsibilities.

To lead means not only to decide general and specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work. Even with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still arise if methods of work are neglected. 

To fulfil its task of exercising leadership, a Party committee must rely on its "squad members" and enable them to play their parts to the full. To be a good "squad leader", the secretary should study hard and investigate thoroughly. 

A secretary or deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his "squad" well if he does not take care to do propaganda and organizational work among his own "squad members'', is not good at handling his relations with committee members or does not study how to run meetings successfully. 

If the "squad members" do not march in step, they can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting and construction. Of course, the relation between the secretary and the committee members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, so it is different from the relation between a squad leader and his men. Here we speak only by way of analogy.

Place problems on the table. This should be done not only by the "squad leader" but by the committee members too. Do not talk behind people's backs. Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions and the problems will be solved. 

If problems exist and are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and even drag on for years. The "squad leader" and the committee members should show understanding in their relations with each other.

Nothing is more important than mutual understanding, support and friendship between the secretary and the committee members, between the Central Committee and its regional bureaus and between the regional bureaus and the area Party committees.

"Exchange information" means that members of a Party committee should keep each other informed and exchange views on matters that have come to their attention. 

This is of great importance in achieving a common language. Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao Tzu, "do not visit each other all their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are within hearing of each other". 

The result is that they lack a common language.

Ask your subordinates about matters you don't understand or don't know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval… 

We should never pretend to know what we don't know, we should "not feel ashamed to ask and learn from people below" and we should listen carefully to the views of the cadres at the lower levels. 

Be a pupil before you become a teacher. Learn from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders… What the cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct, after hearing it, we must analyse it. We must heed the correct views and act upon them… Listen also to the mistaken views from below, it is wrong not to listen to them at all.

Such views, however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized.

Learn to "play the piano". In playing the piano all ten fingers are in motion; it won't do to move some fingers only and not others. But if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody. 

To produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in co-ordination. 

A Party committee should keep a firm grasp on its central task and at the same time, around the central task, it should unfold the work in other fields. At present, we have to take care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed units and departments, and not give all our attention to a few problems, to the exclusion of others. Wherever there is a problem, we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we must master. 

Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is a great difference in the melodies they produce. Members of Party committees must learn to "play the piano" well.

"Grasp firmly." That is to say, the Party committee must not merely "grasp", but must "grasp firmly", its main tasks. One can get a grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the slightest slackening. Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all. 

Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand. When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is
not clenched tightly, there is still no grip. Some of our comrades do grasp themain tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a success of their work. It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will it do if the grasp is not firm.

"Have a head for figures." That is to say, we must attend to the quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis. Every quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without quantity there can be
no quality. 

To this day many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend to the quantitative aspect of things - the basic statistics, the main percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the qualities of things.
They have no "figures" in their heads and as a result cannot help making mistakes.

"Notice to Reassure the Public." Notice of meetings should be given beforehand; this is like issuing a "Notice to Reassure the Public", so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and what problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations. In some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived for the meeting are makeshifts improvised; 

This is just like the saying, "Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are not ready", and that is no good. Don't call a meeting in a hurry if the preparations are not completed.


"Fewer and better troops and simpler administration." Talks, speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the point. Meetings also should not go on too long.

Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with you. 
 
This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in the army. It also applies to relations with people outside the Party. We have come together from every corner of the country and should be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the same views as we but also with those who hold different views.

Ibid.Guard against arrogance. For anyone in a leading position, this is a matter of principle and an important condition for maintaining unity. Even those who have made no serious mistakes and have achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant.

Draw two lines of distinction.

1. Between revolution and counter-revolution, between Yenan and Sian. [1] 

Some do not understand that they must draw this line of distinction. 

For example, when they combat bureaucracy, they speak of Yenan as though "nothing is right" there and fail to make a comparison and distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yenan and
the bureaucracy in Sian. 

This is fundamentally wrong. 

2. Within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary to make a clear distinction between right and wrong, between achievements and shortcomings and to make clear which
of the two is primary and which secondary. 

For instance, do the achievements amount to 30% or to 70% of the whole? 

It will not do either to understate or to overstate. We must have a fundamental evaluation of a person's work and establish whether his achievements amount to 30% and his mistakes to 70 per cent, or vice versa. 

If his achievements amount to 70% of the whole, then his work should in the main be approved. It would be entirely wrong to describe work in which the achievements are primary as work in which the mistakes are primary. 

When we approach problems, we must remember to draw these 2 lines of distinction:
- between revolution and counter-revolution 
- between achievements and shortcomings. 

We shall be able to handle things well if we bear these two distinctions in mind; otherwise we shall confuse the nature of the problems.

To draw these distinctions well, careful study and analysis are of course necessary. Our attitude towards every person and every matter should be one of analysis and study.


In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance.
It should be done on the following lines:

1. The leading bodies of the Party must give a correct line of guidance and find solutions when problems arise, in order to establish themselves as centres of leadership.
2. The higher bodies must be familiar with the situation in the lower bodies and with the life of the masses so as to have an objective basis forcorrect guidance.
3. No Party organization at any level should make casual decisions in solving problems. Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out.
4. All decisions of any importance made by the Party's higher bodies must be promptly transmitted to the lower bodies and the Party rank and file…
5. The lower bodies of the Party and the Party rank and file must discuss the higher bodies' directives in detail in order to understand their meaning thoroughly and decide on the methods of carrying them out.

Note:
1. Yenan was the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from January 1937 to March 1947; Sian was the centre of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in north-western China. Mao cited the 2 cities as symbols of revolution and counter-revolution.
