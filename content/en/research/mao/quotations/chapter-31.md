A man in China is usually subjected to the domination of 3 systems of authority:

1. Political authority
2. Clan authority
3. Religious authority

Women, are also dominated by these, but also dominated by the men as the authority of the husband. 

The 4 authorities are:

1. Political
2. Clan
3. Religious
4. Masculine

These:
- embody the whole feudal-patriarchal ideology and system
- are the four thick ropes binding the Chinese people, particularly the peasants. 

How the peasants have overthrown the political authority of the landlords in the countryside has been described above. 

The political authority of the landlords is the backbone of all the other systems of authority. With that overturned, the clan authority, the religious authority and the authority of the husband all begin to totter

As to the authority of the husband, this has always been weaker among the poor peasants because, out of economic necessity, their womenfolk have to do more manual labour than the women of the richer classes and therefore have more say and greater power of decision in family matters. 

With the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, the basis for men's domination over women has already been undermined. 

With the rise of the peasant movement, the women in many places have now begun to organize rural women's associations; the opportunity has come for them to lift up their heads, and the authority of the husband is getting shakier every day.

In a word, the whole feudal-patriarchal ideology and system is tottering with the growth of the peasants' power.

In order to build a great socialist society it is of the utmost importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive activity. Men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in production. Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole.

With the completion of agricultural cooperation, many co-operatives are finding themselves short of labour. 

It has become necessary to arouse the great mass of women who did not work in the fields before to take their place on the labour front… China 's women are a vast reserve of labour power. This reserve should be tapped in the struggle to build a great socialist country.
