## CHAPTER 37: The Province of Pein

Pein is a province 5 days in length, lying between east and north-east. The people are worshippers of Mahommet, and subjects of the Great Kaan.

There are a good number of towns and villages, but the most noble is Pein, the capital of the kingdom.

There are rivers in this country, in which quantities of Jasper and Chalcedony are found.{2} The people have plenty of all products, including cotton. They live by manufactures and trade. 

But they have a custom that I must relate. If the husband of any woman go away upon a journey and remain away for more than 20 days, as soon as that term is past the woman may marry another man, and the husband also may then marry whom he pleases.{3}

I should tell you that all the provinces that I have been speaking of, from Cascar forward, and those I am going to mention [as far as the city of Lop] belong to Great Turkey.


## CHAPTER 38. The Province of Charchan

Charchan is a Province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east. The people worship Mahommet. There are numerous towns and villages, and the chief city of the kingdom bears its name, Charchan.

The Province contains rivers which bring down Jasper and Chalcedony, and these are carried for sale into Cathay, where they fetch great prices. The whole of the Province is sandy, and so is the road all the way from Pein, and much of the water that you find is bitter and bad. However, at some places you do find fresh and sweet water.

When an army passes through the land, the people escape with their wives, children, and cattle a distance of two or three days’ journey into the sandy waste; and knowing the spots where water is to be had, they are able to live there, and to keep their cattle alive, whilst it is impossible to discover them; for the wind immediately blows the sand over their track.

Quitting Charchan, you ride some five days through the sands, finding none but bad and bitter water, and then you come to a place where the water is sweet. 

Now I will tell you of a province called Lop, in which there is a city, also called Lop, which you come to at the end of those five days. 

It is at the entrance of the great Desert, and it is here that travellers repose before entering on the Desert.{1}


## CHAPTER 39. The City of Lop and the Great Desert.

Lop is a large town at the edge of the Desert, which is called the Desert of Lop, and is situated between east and north-east. 

It belongs to the Great Kaan, and the people worship Mahommet. 

Such persons as propose to cross the Desert take a week’s rest in this town to refresh themselves and their cattle; and then they make ready for the journey, taking with them a month’s supply for man and beast. On quitting this city they enter the Desert.

The length of this Desert is so great that ’tis said it would take a year and more to ride from one end of it to the other. And here, where its breadth is least, it takes a month to cross it. 

’Tis all composed of hills and valleys of sand, and not a thing to eat is to be found on it. 

But after riding for a day and a night you find fresh water, enough mayhap for some 50 or 100 persons with their beasts, but not for more. 

All across the Desert you will find water in like manner, that is to say, in some 28 places altogether you will find good water, but in no great quantity.

In 4 places also you find brackish water.

Beasts there are none; for there is nought for them to eat. 

But there is a marvellous thing related of this Desert, which is that when travellers are on the move by night, and one of them chances to lag behind or to fall asleep or the like, when he tries to gain his company again he will hear spirits talking, and will suppose them to be his comrades. 

Sometimes the spirits will call him by name. Thus shall a traveller ofttimes be led astray so that he never finds his party. 

In this way many have perished. 

Sometimes the stray travellers will hear as it were the tramp and hum of a great cavalcade of people away from the real line of road, and taking this to be their own company they will follow the sound; and when day breaks they find that a cheat has been put on them and that they are in an ill plight.

Even in the day-time one hears those spirits talking. And sometimes you shall hear the sound of a variety of musical instruments, and still more commonly the sound of drums. 

Hence in making this journey ’tis customary for travellers to keep close together. 

All the animals too have bells at their necks, so that they cannot easily get astray. And at sleeping-time a signal is put up to show the direction of the next march.

So thus it is that the Desert is crossed.{3}


## CHAPTER 40: The Great Province of Tangut

After you have travelled thirty days through the Desert, as I have described, you come to a city called Sachiu, lying between north-east and east; it belongs to the Great Kaan, and is in a province called Tangut.

The people are for the most part Idolaters, but there are also some Nestorian Christians and some Saracens. 

The Idolaters have a peculiar language, and are no traders, but live by their agriculture.

They have a great many abbeys and minsters full of idols of sundry fashions, to which they pay great honour and reverence, worshipping them and sacrificing to them with much ado.

For example, such as have children will feed up a sheep 204in honour of the idol, and at the New Year, or on the day of the Idol’s Feast, they will take their children and the sheep along with them into the presence of the idol with great ceremony. 

Then they will have the sheep slaughtered and cooked, and again present it before the idol with like reverence, and leave it there before him, whilst they are reciting the offices of their worship and their prayers for the idol’s blessing on their children.

The idol feeds on the meat that is set before it! 

After these ceremonies they take up the flesh and carry it home, and call together all their kindred to eat it with them in great festivity the idol-priests receiving for their portion the head, feet, entrails, and skin, with some part of the meat. 

After they have eaten, they collect the bones that are left and store them carefully in a hutch.

All the Idolaters in the world burn their dead. When they are going to carry a body to the burning, the kinsfolk build a wooden house on the way to the spot, and drape it with cloths of silk and gold. 

When the body is going past this building they call a halt and set before it wine and meat and other eatables; and this they do with the assurance that the defunct will be received with the like attentions in the other world. 

All the minstrelsy in the town goes playing before the body; and when it reaches the burning-place the kinsfolk are prepared with figures cut out of parchment and paper in the shape of men and horses and camels, and also with round pieces of paper like gold coins, and all these they burn along with the corpse.

For they say that in the other world the defunct will be provided with slaves and cattle and money, just in proportion to the amount of such pieces of paper that has been burnt along with him.

But they never burn their dead until they have [sent for the astrologers, and told them the year, the day, and the hour of the deceased person’s birth, and when the astrologers have ascertained under what constellation, planet, and sign he was born, they declare the day on which, by the rules of their art, he ought to be burnt].

Until that day arrive they keep the body, so that ’tis sometimes a matter of six months, more or less, before it comes to be burnt.{5}

The way they keep the body in the house is this: They make a coffin first of a good span in thickness, very carefully joined and daintily painted. 

This they fill up with camphor and spices, to keep off corruption [stopping the joints with pitch and lime], and then they cover it with a fine cloth.

Every day as long as the body is kept, they set a table before the dead covered with food; and they will have it that the soul comes and eats and drinks: wherefore they leave the food there as long as would be necessary in order that one should partake. Thus they do daily. And worse still! 

Sometimes those soothsayers shall tell them that ’tis not good luck to carry out the corpse by the door, so they have to break a hole in the wall, and to draw it out that way when it is taken to the burning.{6} And these, I assure you, are the practices of all the Idolaters of those countries.

However, we will quit this subject, and I will tell you of another city which lies towards the north-west at the extremity of the desert.
