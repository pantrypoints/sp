I have told you how the Great Kaan provides for the distribution of necessaries to his people in time of dearth, by making store in time of cheapness. 

Now I will tell you of his alms and great charity to the poor of his city of Cambaluc.

You see he causes selection to be made of a number of families in the city which are in a state of indigence, and of such families some may consist of six in the house, some of eight, some of ten, more or fewer in each as it may hap, but the whole number being very great. 

Each family he causes annually to be supplied with wheat and other corn sufficient for the whole year.

This he never fails to do every year.

All those who choose to go to the daily dole at the Court receive a great loaf apiece, hot from the baking, and nobody is denied; for so the Lord hath ordered.

And so some 30,000 people go for it every day from year’s end to year’s end. 

Now this is a great goodness in the Emperor to take pity of his poor people thus! And they benefit so much by it that they worship him as he were God.

He also provides the poor with clothes. For he lays a tithe upon all wool, silk, hemp, and the like, from which clothing can be made. He has these woven and laid up in a building set apart for the purpose.

All artizans are bound to give a day’s labour weekly, in this way the Kaan has these stuffs made into clothing for those poor families, suitable for summer or winter, according to the time of year.

He also provides the clothing for his troops, and has woollens woven for them in every city, the material for which is furnished by the tithe aforesaid.

The Tartars, before they were converted to the religion of the Idolaters, never practised almsgiving. 

When any poor man begged of them they would tell him, “Go with God’s curse, for if He loved you as He loves me, He would have provided for you.” 

But the sages of the Idolaters, and especially the Bacsis mentioned before, told the Great Kaan that it was a good work to provide for the poor, and that his idols would be greatly pleased if he did so.

And since then he has taken to do for the poor so much as you have heard.{1}]


## Chapter 33. The Astrologers in the City of Cambaluc.

The city of Cambaluc, with Christians, Saracens, and Cathayans, has some 5,000 astrologers and soothsayers.

The Great Kaan provides them with annual maintenance and clothing, just as he provides the poor of whom we have spoken.

They are in the constant exercise of their art in this city.

They have a kind of astrolabe on which are inscribed the planetary signs, the hours and critical points of the whole year.

Every year these Christian, Saracen, and Cathayan astrologers, each sect apart, investigate through this astrolabe the course and character of the whole year, according to the indications of each of its Moons.

This is to discover by the natural course and disposition of the planets, and the other circumstances of the heavens, what shall be the nature of the weather, and what peculiarities shall be produced by each Moon of the year.

For example, under which Moon there shall be thunderstorms and tempests, under which there shall be disease, murrain, wars, disorders, and treasons, and so on, according to the indications of each.

<!-- But always adding that it lies with God to do less or more according to His pleasure. And  -->

They write down the results of their examination in little pamphlets for the year, which are called Tacuin.

These are sold for a groat to all who want to know what is coming. 

The astrologers who have the most exact predictions are held to be the greatest adepts in their art, and get the greater fame.

If any one having some great matter in hand, or proposing to make a long journey for traffic or other business, desires to know what will be the upshot, he goes to one of these astrologers and says:

“Turn up your books and see what is the present aspect of the heavens, for I am going away on such and such a business.” 

Then the astrologer will reply that the applicant must also tell the year, month, and hour of his birth.

When he has got that information he will see how the horoscope of his nativity combines with the indications of the time when the question is put, and then he predicts the result, good or bad, according to the aspect of the heavens.

The Tartars reckon their years by 12s.

1. Year 1 is the Lion
2. Year 2 is the Ox
3. Year 3 is the Dragon
4. Year 4 is the Dog

And so forth up to the 12th.

So that when one is asked the year of his birth, he answers that it was in the year of the Lion on such a day or night, at such an hour, and such a moment.

The father of a child always takes care to write these particulars down in a book.

When the 12 yearly symbols have been gone through, then they come back to the first, and go through with them again in the same succession.



## Chapter 34. The Religion of the Cathayans

<!-- ;{1} their views as to the Soul; and their Customs. -->

The Cathayans are Idolaters.

As regards their gods, each has a tablet fixed high up on the wall of his chamber, on which is inscribed a name which represents the Most High and Heavenly God.

Before this they pay daily worship, offering incense from a thurible, raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth 3 times, praying Him to grant them health of mind and body.

But of Him they ask nought else. 

Below on the ground there is a figure which they call Natigai, which is the god of things terrestrial. 

To him they give a wife and children, and they worship him in the same manner, with incense, and gnashing of teeth, and lifting up of hands.

Of him, they ask seasonable weather, and the fruits of the earth, children, and so forth.

They believe that as soon as a man dies, his soul enters into another body, going from a good to a better, or from a bad to a worse, according as he hath conducted himself well or ill. 

If a poor man lived as a good and sober man, he shall be born again into a gentlewoman and shall be a gentleman.

If a gentleman has been good, he shall be born of a princess and shall be a prince.

And so on, always rising, until he be absorbed into the Deity.

But if he was bad, the son of a gentleman shall be reborn as the son of a boor, and from a boor shall become a dog, always going down lower and lower.

The people have an ornate style of speech.

They salute each other with a cheerful countenance, and with great politeness.

They behave like gentlemen, and eat with great propriety.

They show great respect to their parents. If there is any son who offends his parents, or fails to provide their necessities, there is a public office which has no other charge but to punish unnatural children, who are proved to have acted with ingratitude towards their parents.

Criminals of sundry kinds who have been imprisoned, are released at a time fixed by the Great Kaan (which occurs every three years), but on leaving prison they are branded on one cheek that they may be recognized.

The Great Kaan had prohibited all gambling and sharping, things more prevalent there than in any other part of the world.

In doing this, he said: “I have conquered you by force of arms, and all that you have is mine; if, therefore, you gamble away your property, it is in fact my property that you are gambling away.” 

Not that he took anything from them however.

I must not omit to tell you of the orderly way in which the Kaan’s Barons and others conduct themselves in coming to his presence. 

In the first place, within a half mile of the place where he is, out of reverence for his exalted majesty, everybody preserves a mien of the greatest meekness and quiet, so that no noise of shrill voices or loud talk shall be heard.

Every one of the chiefs and nobles carries always with him a handsome little vessel to spit in whilst he remain in the Hall of Audience—for no one dares spit on the floor of the hall,—and when he hath spitten he covers it up and puts it aside.

So also they all have certain handsome buskins of white leather, which they carry with them, and, when summoned by the sovereign, on arriving at the entrance to the hall, they put on these white buskins, and give their others in charge to the servants, in order that they may not foul the fine carpets of silk and gold and divers colours.
