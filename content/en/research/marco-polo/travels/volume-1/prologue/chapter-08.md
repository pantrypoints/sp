How the Great Kaan gave them a Tablet of Gold, bearing his orders in their behalf.

When the Prince had charged them with all his commission, he caused to be given them a Tablet of Gold, on which was inscribed that the 3 Ambassadors should be supplied with everything needful in all the countries through which they should pass—with horses, with escorts, and, in short, with whatever they should require. 

When they had made all needful preparations, the three Ambassadors took their leave of the Emperor and set out.

When they had travelled I know not how many days, the Tartar Baron fell sick, so that he could not ride, and being very ill, and unable to proceed further, he halted at a certain city. So the Two Brothers judged it best that they should leave him behind and proceed to carry out their commission; and, as he was well content that they should do so, they continued their journey.

Whithersoever they went they were honourably provided with whatever they stood in need of, or chose to command.

This was owing to that Tablet of Authority from the Lord which they carried with them.

So they travelled on and on until they arrived at Layas in Hermenia, a journey which occupied them, I assure you, for three years.

It took them so long because they could not always proceed, being stopped sometimes by snow, or by heavy rains falling, or by great torrents which they found in an impassable state.




## Chapter 9

How the Two Brothers came to the city of Acre.

They departed from Layas and came to Acre, arriving there in the month of April, in the year of Christ 1269, and then they learned that the Pope was dead. 

When they found that the Pope was dead, they went to a certain wise Churchman who was Legate for the whole kingdom of Egypt, and a man of great authority.

His name was Theobald of Piacenza, and told him of the mission on which they were come. 

When the Legate heard their story, he was greatly surprised, and deemed the thing to be of great honour and advantage for the whole of Christendom. So his answer to the two Ambassador Brothers was this: 

“Gentlemen, ye see that 18the Pope is dead; wherefore ye must needs have patience until a new Pope be made, and then shall ye be able to execute your charge.” 

Seeing well enough that what the Legate said was just, they observed: “But while the Pope is a-making, we may as well go to Venice and visit our households.” So they departed from Acre and went to Negropont, and from Negropont they continued their voyage to Venice.

On their arrival there, Messer Nicolas found that his wife was dead, and that she had left behind her a son of fifteen years of age, whose name was Marco; and ’tis of him that this Book tells.

The Two Brothers abode at Venice a couple of years, tarrying until a Pope should be made.

## CHAPTER 10

How the Two Brothers again departed from Venice, on their way back to the Great Kaan, and took with them Mark, the son of Messer Nicolas.

When the Two Brothers had tarried as long as I have told you, and saw that never a Pope was made, they said that their return to the Great Kaan must be put off no longer. So they set out from Venice, taking Mark along with them, and went straight back to Acre, where they found the Legate of whom we have spoken. 

They had a good deal of discourse with him concerning the matter, and asked his permission to go to Jerusalem to get some Oil from the Lamp on the Sepulchre, to carry with them to the Great Kaan, as he had enjoined.

The Legate giving them leave, they went from Acre to Jerusalem and got some of the Oil, and then returned to Acre, and went to the Legate and said to him: “As we see no sign of a 20Pope’s being made, we desire to return to the Great Kaan; for we have already tarried long, and there has been more than enough delay.” 

To which the Legate replied: “Since ’tis your wish to go back, I am well content.” Wherefore he caused letters to be written for delivery to the Great Kaan, bearing testimony that the Two Brothers had come in all good faith to accomplish his charge, but that as there was no Pope they had been unable to do so.


## Chapter 11

How the Two Brothers set out from Acre, and Mark along with them.

When the Two Brothers had received the Legate’s letters, they set forth from Acre to return to the Grand Kaan, and got as far as Layas. 

But shortly after their arrival there they had news that the Legate aforesaid was chosen Pope, taking the name of Pope Gregory of Piacenza; news which the Two Brothers were very glad indeed to hear.

Presently there reached them at Layas a message from the Legate, now the Pope, desiring them, on the part of the Apostolic See, not to proceed further on their journey, but to return to him incontinently. 

And what shall I tell you? The King of 21Hermenia caused a galley to be got ready for the Two Ambassador Brothers, and despatched them to the Pope at Acre.
