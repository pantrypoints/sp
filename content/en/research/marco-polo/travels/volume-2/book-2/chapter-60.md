## Part Iii.—Journey Southward Through Eastern Provinces Of Cathay And Manzi


Cacanfu is a noble city. The people are Idolaters and burn their dead.

They have paper-money, and live by trade and handicrafts. 

For they have plenty of silk from which they weave stuffs of silk and gold, and sendals in large quantities. [There are also certain Christians at this place, who have a church.] And the city is at the head of an important territory containing numerous towns and villages. [

A great river passes through it, on which much merchandise is carried to the city of Cambaluc, for by many channels and canals it is connected therewith.{1}]

Three days travel south is a town called Changlu. This is another great city belonging to the Great Kaan, and to the province of Cathay. 

The people have paper-money, and are Idolaters and burn their 133dead. And you must know they make salt in great quantities at this place; I will tell you how ’tis done.{2}

A kind of earth is found there which is exceedingly salt. This they dig up and pile in great heaps. Upon these heaps they pour water in quantities till it runs out at the bottom; and then they take up this water and boil it well in great iron cauldrons, and as it cools it deposits a fine white salt in very small grains. This salt they then carry about for sale to many neighbouring districts, and get great profit thereby.

There is nothing else worth mentioning, so let us go forward five days’ journey, and we shall come to a city called Chinangli.


## CHAPTER 61. The City of Chinangli, and that of Tadinfu, and the Rebellion of Litan.

Chinangli is a city of Cathay as you go south, and it belongs to the Great Kaan; the people are Idolaters, and have paper-money. There runs through the city a great and wide river, on which a large traffic in silk goods and spices and other costly merchandize passes up and down.

When you travel south from Chinangli for 5 days, you meet everywhere with fine towns and villages, the people of which are all Idolaters, and burn their dead, and are subject to the Great Kaan, and have paper-money, and live by trade and handicrafts, and have all the necessaries of life in great abundance. But there is nothing particular to mention on the way till you come, at the end of those five days, to Tadinfu.{1}

This is a very great city.

In old times was the seat of a great kingdom.

But the Great Kaan conquered it by force.

Nevertheless it is still the noblest city in all those provinces. 

There are very great merchants here, who trade on a great scale. The abundance of silk is marvellous. 

They have the most charming gardens abounding with fruit of large size. 

The city of Tadinfu hath also under its rule eleven imperial cities of great importance, all of which enjoy a large and profitable trade, owing to that immense produce of silk.{2}

In 1273, the Great Kaan had sent a certain Baron called Liytan Sangon, with 80,000 horse to this province and city to garrison them. 

And after the said captain had tarried there a while, he formed a disloyal and traitorous plot, and stirred up the great men of the province to rebel against the Great Kaan.

<!-- And so they did; for they broke into revolt against their sovereign lord, and refused all obedience to him, and made this Liytan, whom their sovereign had sent thither for their protection, to be the chief of their revolt. -->

When the Great Kaan heard it, he straightway despatched 2 of his Barons:
- Aguil
- Mongotay

He gave them 100,000 horse and a great force of infantry. 

But the affair was a serious one, for the Barons were met by the rebel Liytan with all those whom he had collected from the province, mustering more than 100,000 horse and a large force of foot. 

Nevertheless in the battle Liytan and his party were utterly routed, and the two Barons whom the Emperor had sent won the victory. 

When the news came to the Great Kaan he was right well pleased, and ordered that all the chiefs who had rebelled, or excited others to rebel, should be put to a cruel death, but that those of lower rank should receive a pardon. 

<!-- The two Barons had all the leaders of the enterprise put to a cruel death, and all those of lower rank were pardoned. And -->

Thenceforward they conducted themselves with loyalty towards their lord.{5}

<!-- Now we go south to Sinju-matu. -->


## CHAPTER 62. The Noble City of Sinjumatu.

On leaving Tadinfu you travel 3 days towards the south, always finding numbers of noble and populous towns and villages flourishing with trade and manufactures.

There is also abundance of game in the country, and everything in profusion.

After 3 days you come to the noble city of Sinjumatu, a rich and fine place, with great trade and manufactures. 

The people are Idolaters and subjects of the Great Kaan, and have paper-money.

They have a river which I can assure you brings them great gain, and I will tell you about it.

You see the river in question flows from the South to this city of Sinjumatu. 

The people of the city have divided this larger river in two, making one half of it flow east and the other half flow west.

One branch flows towards Manzi and the other towards Cathay. 

The number of vessels at this city is what no one would believe without seeing them. 

The quantity of merchandize also which these vessels transport to Manzi and Cathay is something marvellous.

Then they return loaded with other merchandize, so that the amount of goods borne to and fro on those two rivers is quite astonishing.{1}



## CHAPTER 63. The Cities of Linju and Piju.

On leaving the city of Sinju-matu you travel for eight days towards the south, always coming to great and rich towns and villages flourishing with trade and manufactures. 

The people are all subjects of the Great Kaan, use paper-money, and burn their dead. 

At the end of those eight days you come to the city of Linju, in the province of the same name of which it is the capital.

It is a rich and noble city, and the men are good soldiers, natheless they carry on great trade and manufactures. 

There is a lot of game in both beasts and birds. All the necessaries of life are in profusion.

The place stands on the river of which I told you above. And they have here great numbers of vessels, even greater than those of which I spoke before, and these transport a great amount of costly merchandize{1}.

So, quitting this province and city of Linju, you travel three days more towards the south, constantly finding numbers of rich towns and villages. 

These still belong to Cathay; and the people are all Idolaters, burning their dead, and using paper-money, that I mean of their Lord the Great Kaan, whose subjects they are. This is the finest country for game, whether in beasts or birds, that is anywhere to be found, and all the necessaries of life are in profusion.

At the end of those three days you find the city of Piju, a great, rich, and noble city, with large trade and manufactures, and a great production of silk. 

This city stands at the entrance to the great province of Manzi, and there reside at it a great number of merchants who despatch carts from this place loaded with great quantities of goods to the different towns of Manzi. 

The city brings in a great revenue to the Great Kaan.{2}



## CHAPTER 64. The City of Siju, and the Great River Caramoran

When you leave Piju you travel towards the south for 2 days, through beautiful districts abounding in everything, and in which you find quantities of all kinds of game.

At the end of those 2 days you reach the city of Siju, a great, rich, and noble city, flourishing with trade and manufactures. 

The people:
- are Idolaters
- burn their dead
- use paper-money
- are subjects of the Great Kaan

They possess extensive and fertile plains producing abundance of wheat and other grain.

<!-- But there is nothing else to mention, so let us proceed and tell you of the countries further on. -->

On leaving Siju you ride south for 3 days, constantly falling in with fine towns and villages and hamlets and farms, with their cultivated lands.

There is plenty of wheat and other corn, and game. The people are all Idolaters and subjects of the Great Kaan.

At the end of those 3 days you reach the great river Caramoran, which flows hither from Prester John’s country. 

It is a great river, and more than a mile in width, and so deep that great ships can navigate it. It abounds in fish, and very big ones too.

In this river there are some 15,000 vessels, all belonging to the Great Kaan, and kept to transport his troops to the Indian Isles whenever there may be occasion; for the sea is only 1 day away from here.

Each of these vessels will require 20 mariners, and will carry 15 horses with the men belonging to them, and their provisions, arms, and equipments.

On either bank of the river, stands a town; the one facing the other.

The one is called Coiganju, larger than the other called Caiju.

When you pass this river you enter the great province of Manzi.

<!-- So now I must tell you how this province of Manzi was conquered by the Great Kaan.{3} -->



## CHAPTER 65. How the Great Kaan conquered the Province of Manzi

The great territory of Manzi had a great king who was styled Facfur. 

He was so great and puissant a prince, that for vastness of wealth and number of subjects and extent of dominion, there was hardly a greater in all the earth except the Great Kaan himself.

But the people of his land were anything rather than warriors; all their delight was in women, and nought but women.

And so it was above all with the King himself, for he took thought of nothing else but women, unless it were of charity to the poor.

In all his dominion there were no horses; nor were the people ever inured to battle or arms, or military service of any kind. 

Yet the province of Manzi is very strong by nature. All its cities are encompassed by sheets of deep water, and more than an arblast-shot in width.

The country never would have been lost had the people been soldiers.

<!-- But that is just what they were not; so lost it was. -->

In 1268, the Kublai Kaan despatched there a Baron Bayan Chincsan meaning “Bayan Hundred Eyes.” 

The King of Manzi had found in his horoscope that he never should lose his Kingdom except through a man that had an hundred eyes.

So he held himself assured in his position, for he could not believe that any man in existence could have an hundred eyes.

There, however, he deluded himself, in his ignorance of the name of Bayan.

This Bayan had an immense force of horse and foot entrusted to him by the Great Kaan, and with these he entered Manzi.

He also had many boats to carry both horse and food when need should be.

And when he, with all his host, entered the territory of Manzi and arrived at this city of Coiganju—whither we now are got, and of which we shall speak presently—he summoned the people thereof to surrender to the Great Kaan; but this they flatly refused. 

On this Bayan went on to another city, with the same result, and then still went forward; acting thus because he was aware that the Great Kaan was despatching another great host to follow him up.

He advanced to 5 cities in succession, but got possession of none of them.

For he did not wish to engage in besieging them and they would not give themselves up. 

But when he came to the sixth city he took that by storm, and so with a second, and a third, and a fourth, until he had taken twelve cities in succession.

When he had taken all these he advanced straight against the capital city of the kingdom, which was called Kinsay, and which was the residence of the King and Queen.

When the King beheld Bayan coming with all his host, he was in great dismay, as one unused to see such sights.

So he and a great company of his people got on board a thousand ships and fled to the islands of the Ocean Sea, whilst the Queen who remained behind in the city took all measures in her power for its defence, like a valiant lady.

The Queen asked what was the name of the captain of the host. They told her that it was Bayan Hundred-Eyes.

So when she wist that he was styled Hundred-Eyes, she called to mind how their astrologers had foretold that a man of an hundred eyes should strip them of the kingdom.

Wherefore she gave herself up to Bayan, and surrendered to him the whole kingdom and all the other cities and fortresses, so that no resistance was made. And in sooth this was a goodly conquest, for there was no realm on earth half so wealthy.

The amount that the King used to expend was perfectly marvellous; and as an 147example I will tell you somewhat of his liberal acts.

In those provinces they are wont to expose their new-born babes; I speak of the poor, who have not the means of bringing them up. But the King used to have all those foundlings taken charge of, and had note made of the signs and planets under which each was born, and then put them out to nurse about the country. 

And when any rich man was childless he would go to the King and obtain from him as many of these children as he desired. Or, when the children grew up, the King would make up marriages among them, and provide for the couples from his own purse. In this manner he used to provide for some 20,000 boys and girls every year.

I will tell you another thing this King used to do.

If he was taking a ride through the city and chanced to see a house that was very small and poor standing among other houses that were fine and large, he would ask why it was so, and they would tell him it belonged to a poor man who had not the means to enlarge it. Then the King would himself supply the means. And thus it came to pass that in all the capital of the kingdom of Manzi, Kinsay by name, you should not see any but fine houses.

This King used to be waited on by more than 1,000 young gentlemen and ladies, all clothed in the richest fashion. 

He ruled his realm with such justice that no malefactors were to be found therein.

The city in fact was so secure that no man closed his doors at night, not even in houses and shops that were full of all sorts of rich merchandize. 

No one could do justice in the telling to the great riches of that country, and to the good disposition of the people. Now that I have told you about the kingdom, I will go back to the Queen.

The Queen was conducted to the Great Kaan, who gave her an honourable reception, and caused her to be served with all state, like a great lady as she was. 

But as for the King her husband, he never more did quit the isles of the sea to which he had fled, but died there.

<!-- So leave we him and his wife and all their concerns, and let us return to our story, and go on regularly with our account of the great province of Manzi and of the manners and customs of its people. And, to begin at the beginning, we must go back to the city of Coiganju, from which we digressed to tell you about the conquest of Manzi. -->
