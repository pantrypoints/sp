§ 1. We have seen that economics is, on the one side, a Science of Wealth; and, on the
other, that part of the Social Science of man's action in society, which deals with his
Efforts to satisfy his Wants, in so far as the efforts and wants are capable of being
measured in terms of wealth, or its general representative, i.e. money. We shall be
occupied during the greater part of this volume with these wants and efforts; and with
the causes by which the prices that measure the wants are brought into equilibrium
with those that measure the efforts. 

For this purpose we shall have to study in Book 3. wealth in relation to the diversity of man's wants, which it has to satisfy; and in
Book IV. wealth in relation to the diversity of man's efforts by which it is produced.
But in the present Book, we have to inquire which of all the things that are the result
of man's efforts, and are capable of satisfying man's wants, are to be counted as
Wealth; and into what groups or classes these are to be divided. For there is a compact
group of terms connected with Wealth itself, and with Capital, the study of each of
which throws light on the others; while the study of the whole together is a direct
continuation, and in some respects a completion, of that inquiry as to the scope and
methods of economics on which we have just been engaged. And, therefore, instead
of taking what may seem the more natural course of starting with an analysis of
wants, and of wealth in direct relation to them, it seems on the whole best to deal with
this group of terms at once.

In doing this we shall of course have to take some account of the variety of wants and
efforts; but we shall not want to assume anything that is not obvious and a matter of
common knowledge. The real difficulty of our task lies in another direction; being the
result of the need under which economics, alone among sciences, lies of making shift
with a few terms in common use to express a great number of subtle distinctions.

 § 2. As Mill says17 :—"The ends of scientific classification are best answered when
the objects are formed into groups respecting which a greater number of general
propositions can be made, and those propositions more important, than those which
could be made respecting any other groups into which the same things could be
distributed." But we meet at starting with the difficulty that those propositions which
are the most important in one stage of economic development, are not unlikely to be
among the least important in another, if indeed they apply at all.


In this matter economists have much to learn from the recent experiences of biology:
and Darwin's profound discussion of the question18 throws a strong light on the
difficulties before us. He points out that those parts of the structure which determine
the habits of life and the general place of each being in the economy of nature, are as
a rule not those which throw most light on its origin, but those which throw least. The
qualities which a breeder or a gardener notices as eminently adapted to enable an
animal or a plant to thrive in its environment, are for that very reason likely to have
been developed in comparatively recent times. And in like manner those properties of
an economic institution which play the most important part in fitting it for the work
which it has to do now, are for that very reason likely to be in a great measure of
recent growth.

Instances are found in many of the relations between employer and employed,
between middleman and producer, between bankers and their two classes of clients,
those from whom they borrow and those to whom they lend. The substitution of the
term "interest" for "usury" corresponds to a general change in the character of loans,
which has given an entirely new key-note to our analysis and classification of the
different elements into which the cost of production of a commodity may be resolved.
Again, the general scheme of division of labour into skilled and unskilled is
undergoing a gradual change; the scope of the term "rent" is being broadened in some
directions and narrowed in others; and so on.

But on the other hand we must keep constantly in mind the history of the terms which
we use. For, to begin with, this history is important for its own sake; and because it
throws side lights on the history of the economic development of society. And further,
even if the sole purpose of our study of economics were to obtain knowledge that
would guide us in the attainment of immediate practical ends, we should yet be bound
to keep our use of terms as much as possible in harmony with the traditions of the
past; in order that we might be quick to perceive the indirect hints and the subtle and
subdued warnings, which the experiences of our ancestors offer for our instruction.
§ 3. Our task is difficult. In physical sciences indeed, whenever it is seen that a group
of things have a certain set of qualities in common, and will often be spoken of
together, they are formed into a class with a special name; and as soon as a new
notion emerges, a new technical term is invented to represent it. But economics
cannot venture to follow this example. Its reasonings must be expressed in language
that is intelligible to the general public; it must therefore endeavour to conform itself
to the familiar terms of everyday life, and so far as possible must use them as they are
commonly used.

In common use almost every word has many shades of meaning, and therefore needs
to be interpreted by the context. And, as Bagehot has pointed out, even the most
formal writers on economic science are compelled to follow this course; for otherwise
they would not have enough words at their disposal. But unfortunately they do not
always avow that they are taking this freedom; sometimes perhaps they are scarcely
even aware of the fact themselves. The bold and rigid definitions, with which their
expositions of the science begin, lull the reader into a false security. 

Not being warned
that he must often look to the context for a special interpretation clause, he ascribes to what he reads a meaning different from that which the writers had in their own minds;
and perhaps misrepresents them and accuses them of folly of which they had not been
guilty19 .

Again, most of the chief distinctions marked by economic terms are differences not of
kind but of degree. At first sight they appear to be differences of kind, and to have
sharp outlines which can be clearly marked out; but a more careful study has shown
that there is no real breach of continuity. It is a remarkable fact that the progress of
economics has discovered hardly any new real differences in kind, while it is
continually resolving apparent differences in kind into differences in degree. We shall
meet with many instances of the evil that may be done by attempting to draw broad,
hard and fast lines of division, and to formulate definite propositions with regard to
differences between things which nature has not separated by any such lines.

§ 4. We must then analyze carefully the real characteristics of the various things with
which we have to deal; and we shall thus generally find that there is some use of each
term which has distinctly greater claims than any other to be called its leading use, on
the ground that it represents a distinction that is more important for the purposes of
modern science than any other that is in harmony with ordinary usage. This may be
laid down as the meaning to be given to the term whenever nothing to the contrary is
stated or implied by the context. When the term is wanted to be used in any other
sense, whether broader or narrower, the change must be indicated.
Even among the most careful thinkers there will always remain differences of opinion
as to the exact places in which some at least of the lines of definition should be drawn.
The questions at issue must in general be solved by judgments as to the practical
convenience of different courses; and such judgments cannot always be established or
overthrown by scientific reasoning: there must remain a margin of debatable ground.
But there is no such margin in the analysis itself: if two people differ with regard to
that, they cannot both be right. And the progress of the science may be expected
gradually to establish this analysis on an impregnable basis20 .
