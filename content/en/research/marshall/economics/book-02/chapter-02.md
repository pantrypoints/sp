§ 1. All wealth consists of desirable things; that is, things which satisfy human wants
directly or indirectly: but not all desirable things are reckoned as wealth. The affection
of friends, for instance, is an important element of wellbeing, but it is not reckoned as
wealth, except by a poetic licence. Let us then begin by classifying desirable things,
and then consider which of them should be accounted as elements of wealth.
In the absence of any short term in common use to represent all desirable things, or
things that satisfy human wants, we may use the term Goods for that purpose.
Desirable things or goods are Material, or Personal and Immaterial. Material goods
consist of useful material things, and of all rights to hold, or use, or derive benefits
from material things, or to receive them at a future time. Thus they include the
physical gifts of nature, land and water, air and climate; the products of agriculture,
mining, fishing, and manufacture; buildings, machinery, and implements; mortgages
and other bonds; shares in public and private companies, all kinds of monopolies,
patent-rights, copyrights; also rights of way and other rights of usage. Lastly,
opportunities of travel, access to good scenery, museums, etc. are the embodiment of
material facilities, external to a man; though the faculty of appreciating them is
internal and personal.

A man's non-material goods fall into two classes. One consists of his own qualities
and faculties for action and for enjoyment; such for instance as business ability,
professional skill, or the faculty of deriving recreation from reading or music. All
these lie within himself and are called internal. The second class are called external
because they consist of relations beneficial to him with other people. Such, for
instance, were the labour dues and personal services of various kinds which the ruling
classes used to require from their serfs and other dependents. But these have passed
away; and the chief instances of such relations beneficial to their owner now-a-days
are to be found in the good will and business connection of traders and professional
men21 .

Again, goods may be transferable or non-transferable. Among the latter are to be
classed a person's qualities and faculties for action and enjoyment (i.e. his internal
goods); also such part of his business connection as depends on personal trust in him
and cannot be transferred, as part of his vendible good will; also the advantages of
climate, light, air, and his privileges of citizenship and rights and opportunities of
making use of public property22 .


Those goods are free, which are not appropriated and are afforded by Nature without
requiring the effort of man. The land in its original state was a free gift of nature. But
in settled countries it is not a free good from the point of view of the individual. Wood
is still free in some Brazilian forests. The fish of the sea are free generally: but some
sea fisheries are jealously guarded for the exclusive use of members of a certain
nation, and may be classed as national property. Oyster beds that have been planted
by man are not free in any sense; those that have grown naturally are free in every
sense if they are not appropriated; if they are private property they are still free gifts
from the point of view of the nation. But, since the nation has allowed its rights in
them to become vested in private persons, they are not free from the point of view of
the individual; and the same is true of private rights of fishing in rivers. But wheat
grown on free land and the fish that have been landed from free fisheries are not free:
for they have been acquired by labour.

§ 2. We may now pass to the question which classes of a man's goods are to be
reckoned as part of his wealth. The question is one as to which there is some
difference of opinion, but the balance of argument as well as of authority seems
clearly to incline in favour of the following answer:

When a man's wealth is spoken of simply, and without any interpretation clause in the
context, it is to be taken to be his stock of two classes of goods.
In the first class are those material goods to which he has (by law or custom) private
rights of property, and which are therefore transferable and exchangeable. These it
will be remembered include not only such things as land and houses, furniture and
machinery, and other material things which may be in his single private ownership,
but also any shares in public companies, debenture bonds, mortgages and other
obligations which he may hold requiring others to pay money or goods to him. On the
other hand, the debts which he owes to others may be regarded as negative wealth;
and they must be subtracted from his gross possessions before his true net wealth can
be found.

Services and other goods, which pass out of existence in the same instant that they
come into it, are, of course, not part of the stock of wealth23 .


In the second class are those immaterial goods which belong to him, are external to
him, and serve directly as the means of enabling him to acquire material goods. Thus
it excludes all his own personal qualities and faculties, even those which enable him
to earn his living; because they are Internal. And it excludes his personal friendships,
in so far as they have no direct business value. But it includes his business and
professional connections, the organization of his business, and—where such things
exist—his property in slaves, in labour dues, etc.

This use of the term Wealth is in harmony with the usage of ordinary life: and, at the
same time, it includes those goods, and only those, which come clearly within the
scope of economic science, as defined in Book I.; and which may therefore be called
economic goods. For it includes all those things, external to a man, which (i) belong to
him, and do not belong equally to his neighbours, and therefore are distinctly his; and
which (ii) are directly capable of a money measure,—a measure that represents on the
one side the efforts and sacrifices by which they have been called into existence, and,
on the other, the wants which they satisfy24 .

§ 3. A broader view of wealth may indeed be taken for some purposes; but then
recourse must be had to a special interpretation clause, to prevent confusion. Thus, for
instance, the carpenter's skill is as direct a means of enabling him to satisfy other
people's material wants, and therefore indirectly his own, as are the tools in his work-
basket; and perhaps it may be convenient to have a term which will include it as part
of wealth in a broader use. Pursuing the lines indicated by Adam Smith25 , and
followed by most continental economists, we may define personal wealth so as to
include all those energies, faculties, and habits which directly contribute to making
people industrially efficient; together with those business connections and
associations of any kind, which we have already reckoned as part of wealth in the
narrower use of the term. Industrial faculties have a further claim to be regarded as
economic in the fact that their value is as a rule capable of some sort of indirect
measurement26 .

The question whether it is ever worth while to speak of them as wealth is merely one
of convenience, though it has been much discussed as if it were one of principle.
Confusion would certainly be caused by using the term "wealth" by itself when we
desire to include a person's industrial qualities. "Wealth" simply should always mean
external wealth only. But little harm, and some good seems likely to arise from the
occasional use of the phrase "material and personal wealth."


§ 4. But we still have to take account of those material goods which are common to
him with his neighbours; and which therefore it would be a needless trouble to
mention when comparing his wealth with theirs; though they may be important for
some purposes, and especially for comparisons between the economic conditions of
distant places or distant times.

These goods consist of the benefits which he derives from living in a certain place at a
certain time, and being a member of a certain state or community; they include civil
and military security, and the right and opportunity to make use of public property and institutions of all kinds, such as roads, gaslight, etc., and rights to justice or to a
free education. The townsman and the countryman have each of them for nothing
many advantages which the other either cannot get at all, or can get only at great
expense. Other things being equal, one person has more real wealth in its broadest
sense than another, if the place in which the former lives has a better climate, better
roads, better water, more wholesome drainage; and again better newspapers, books,
and places of amusement and instruction. House-room, food and clothing, which
would be insufficient in a cold climate, may be abundant in a warm climate: on the
other hand, that warmth which lessens men's physical needs, and makes them rich
with but a slight provision of material wealth, makes them poor in the energy that
procures wealth.

Many of these things are collective goods; i.e. goods which are not in private
ownership. And this brings us to consider wealth from the social, as opposed to the
individual point of view.

§ 5. Let us then look at those elements of the wealth of a nation which are commonly
ignored when estimating the wealth of the individuals composing it. The most
obvious forms of such wealth are public material property of all kinds, such as roads
and canals, buildings and parks, gasworks and waterworks; though unfortunately
many of them have been secured not by public savings, but by public borrowings, and
there is the heavy "negative" wealth of a large debt to be set against them.
But the Thames has added more to the wealth of England than all its canals, and
perhaps even than all its railroads. And though the Thames is a free gift of nature
(except in so far as its navigation has been improved), while the canal is the work of
man, yet we ought for many purposes to reckon the Thames a part of England's
wealth.

German economists often lay stress on the non-material elements of national wealth;
and it is right to do this in some problems relating to national wealth, but not in all.
Scientific knowledge indeed, wherever discovered, soon becomes the property of the
whole civilized world, and may be considered as cosmopolitan rather than as specially
national wealth. The same is true of mechanical inventions and of many other
improvements in the arts of production; and it is true of music. But those kinds of
literature which lose their force by translation, may be regarded as in a special sense
the wealth of those nations in whose language they are written. And the organization
of a free and well-ordered State is to be regarded for some purposes as an important
element of national wealth.

But national wealth includes the individual as well as the collective property of its
members. And in estimating the aggregate sum of their individual wealth, we may
save some trouble by omitting all debts and other obligations due to one member of a
nation from another. For instance, so far as the English national debt and the bonds of
an English railway are owned within the nation, we can adopt the simple plan of
counting the railway itself as part of the national wealth, and neglecting railway and
government bonds altogether. But we still have to deduct for those bonds etc. issued by the English Government or by private Englishmen, and held by foreigners; and to
add for those foreign bonds etc. held by Englishmen27 .

Cosmopolitan wealth differs from national wealth much as that differs from
individual wealth. In reckoning it, debts due from members of one nation to those of
another may conveniently be omitted from both sides of the account. Again, just as
rivers are important elements of national wealth, the ocean is one of the most valuable
properties of the world. The notion of cosmopolitan wealth is indeed nothing more
than that of national wealth extended over the whole area of the globe.

Individual and national rights to wealth rest on the basis of civil and international law,
or at least of custom that has the force of law. An exhaustive investigation of the
economic conditions of any time and place requires therefore an inquiry into law and
custom; and economics owes much to those who have worked in this direction. But its
boundaries are already wide; and the historical and juridical bases of the conceptions
of property are vast subjects which may best be discussed in separate treatises.


§ 6. The notion of Value is intimately connected with that of Wealth; and a little may
be said about it here. "The word value" says Adam Smith "has two different
meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object and
sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object
conveys." But experience has shown that it is not well to use the word in the former
sense.

The value, that is the exchange value, of one thing in terms of another at any place
and time, is the amount of that second thing which can be got there and then in
exchange for the first. Thus the term value is relative, and expresses the relation
between two things at a particular place and time.
Civilized countries generally adopt gold or silver or both as money. Instead of
expressing the values of lead and tin, and wood, and corn and other things in terms of
one another, we express them in terms of money in the first instance; and call the
value of each thing thus expressed its price. If we know that a ton of lead will
exchange for fifteen sovereigns at any place and time, while a ton of tin will exchange
for ninety sovereigns, we say that their prices then and there are £15 and £90
respectively, and we know that the value of a ton of tin in terms of lead is six tons
then and there.

The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place; and with
every such change the purchasing power of money changes so far as that thing goes.
If the purchasing power of money rises with regard to some things, and at the same
time falls equally with regard to equally important things, its general purchasing
power (or its power of purchasing things in general) has remained stationary. This
phrase conceals some difficulties, which we must study later on. But meanwhile we
may take it in its popular sense, which is sufficiently clear; and we may throughout
this volume neglect possible changes in the general purchasing power of money. Thus
the price of anything will be taken as representative of its exchange value relatively to things in general, or in other words as representative of its general purchasing
power28 .

But if inventions have increased man's power over nature very much, then the real
value of money is better measured for some purposes in labour than in commodities.
This difficulty however will not much affect our work in the present volume, which is
only a study of the "Foundations" of economics.
