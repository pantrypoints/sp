§ 1. A BUSINESS firm grows and attains great strength, and afterwards perhaps
stagnates and decays; and at the turning point there is a balancing or equilibrium of
the forces of life and decay: the latter part of Book IV. has been chiefly occupied with
such balancing of forces in the life and decay of a people, or of a method of industry
or trading. And as we reach to the higher stages of our work, we shall need ever more
and more to think of economic forces as resembling those which make a young man
grow in strength, till he reaches his prime; after which he gradually becomes stiff and
inactive, till at last he sinks to make room for other and more vigorous life. But to
prepare the way for this advanced study we want first to look at a simpler balancing of
forces which corresponds rather to the mechanical equilibrium of a stone hanging by
an elastic string, or of a number of balls resting against one another in a basin.
We have now to examine the general relations of demand and supply; especially those
which are connected with that adjustment of price, by which they are maintained in
"equilibrium." This term is in common use and may be used for the present without
special explanation. But there are many difficulties connected with it, which can only
be handled gradually: and indeed they will occupy our attention during a great part of
this Book.

Illustrations will be taken now from one class of economic problems and now from
another, but the main course of the reasoning will be kept free from assumptions
which specially belong to any particular class.

Thus it is not descriptive, nor does it deal constructively with real problems. But it
sets out the theoretical backbone of our knowledge of the causes which govern value,
and thus prepares the way for the construction which is to begin in the following
Book. It aims not so much at the attainment of knowledge, as at the power to obtain
and arrange knowledge with regard to two opposing sets of forces, those which impel
man to economic efforts and sacrifices, and those which hold him back.

We must begin with a short and provisional account of markets: for that is needed to
give precision to the ideas in this and the following Books. But the organization of
markets is intimately connected both as cause and effect with money, credit, and
foreign trade; a full study of it must therefore be deferred to a later volume, where it will be taken in connection with commercial and industrial fluctuations, and with
combinations of producers and of merchants, of employers and employed.

§ 2. When demand and supply are spoken of in relation to one another, it is of course
necessary that the markets to which they refer should be the same. As Cournot says,
"Economists understand by the term Market, not any particular market place in which
things are bought and sold, but the whole of any region in which buyers and sellers
are in such free intercourse with one another that the prices of the same goods tend to
equality easily and quickly1 ." Or again as Jevons says:—"Originally a market was a
public place in a town where provisions and other objects were exposed for sale; but
the word has been generalized, so as to mean any body of persons who are in intimate
business relations and carry on extensive transactions in any commodity. A great city
may contain as many markets as there are important branches of trade, and these
markets may or may not be localized. The central point of a market is the public
exchange, mart or auction rooms, where the traders agree to meet and transact
business. In London the Stock Market, the Corn Market, the Coal Market, the Sugar
Market, and many others are distinctly localized; in Manchester the Cotton Market,
the Cotton Waste Market, and others. But this distinction of locality is not necessary.
The traders may be spread over a whole town, or region of country, and yet make a
market, if they are, by means of fairs, meetings, published price lists, the post-office
or otherwise, in close communication with each other2 ."

Thus the more nearly perfect a market is, the stronger is the tendency for the same
price to be paid for the same thing at the same time in all parts of the market: but of
course if the market is large, allowance must be made for the expense of delivering
the goods to different purchasers; each of whom must be supposed to pay in addition
to the market price a special charge on account of delivery3 .

§ 3. In applying economic reasonings in practice it is often difficult to ascertain how
far the movements of supply and demand in any one place are influenced by those in
another. It is clear that the general tendency of the telegraph, the printing-press and
steam traffic is to extend the area over which such influences act and to increase their
force. The whole Western World may, in a sense, be regarded as one market for many
kinds of stock exchange securities, for the more valuable metals, and to a less extent
for wool and cotton and even wheat; proper allowance being made for expenses of
transport, in which may be included taxes levied by any customs houses through
which the goods have to pass. For in all these cases the expenses of transport,
including customs duties, are not sufficient to prevent buyers from all parts of the
Western World from competing with one another for the same supplies.

There are many special causes which may widen or narrow the market of any
particular commodity: but nearly all those things for which there is a very wide
market are in universal demand, and capable of being easily and exactly described.
Thus for instance cotton, wheat, and iron satisfy wants that are urgent and nearly
universal. They can be easily described, so that they can be bought and sold by
persons at a distance from one another and at a distance also from the commodities. If
necessary, samples can be taken of them which are truly representative: and they can
even be "graded," as is the actual practice with regard to grain in America, by an independent authority; so that the purchaser may be secure that what he buys will
come up to a given standard, though he has never seen a sample of the goods which
he is buying and perhaps would not be able himself to form an opinion on it if he did4
.
Commodities for which there is a very wide market must also be such as will bear a
long carriage: they must be somewhat durable, and their value must be considerable in
proportion to their bulk. A thing which is so bulky that its price is necessarily raised
very much when it is sold far away from the place in which it is produced, must as a
rule have a narrow market. The market for common bricks for instance is practically
confined to the near neighbourhood of the kilns in which they are made: they can
scarcely ever bear a long carriage by land to a district which has any kilns of its own.
But bricks of certain exceptional kinds have markets extending over a great part of
England.
§ 4. Let us then consider more closely the markets for things which satisfy in an
exceptional way these conditions of being in general demand, cognizable and
portable. They are, as we have said, stock exchange securities and the more valuable
metals.

Any one share or bond of a public company, or any bond of a government is of
exactly the same value as any other of the same issue: it can make no difference to
any purchaser which of the two he buys. Some securities, principally those of
comparatively small mining, shipping, and other companies, require local knowledge,
and are not very easily dealt in except on the stock exchanges of provincial towns in
their immediate neighbourhood. But the whole of England is one market for the
shares and bonds of a large English railway. In ordinary times a dealer will sell, say,
Midland Railway shares, even if he has not them himself; because he knows they are
always coming into the market, and he is sure to be able to buy them.

But the strongest case of all is that of securities which are called "international,"
because they are in request in every part of the globe. They are the bonds of the chief
governments, and of very large public companies such as those of the Suez Canal and
the New York Central Railway. For bonds of this class the telegraph keeps prices at
almost exactly the same level in all the stock exchanges of the world. If the price of
one of them rises in New York or in Paris, in London or in Berlin, the mere news of
the rise tends to cause a rise in other markets; and if for any reason the rise is delayed,
that particular class of bonds is likely soon to be offered for sale in the high priced
market under telegraphic orders from the other markets, while dealers in the first
market will be making telegraphic purchases in other markets. These sales on the one
hand, and purchases on the other, strengthen the tendency which the price has to seek
the same level everywhere; and unless some of the markets are in an abnormal
condition, the tendency soon becomes irresistible.

On the stock exchange also a dealer can generally make sure of selling at nearly the
same price as that at which he buys; and he is often willing to buy first class stocks at
a half, or a quarter, or an eighth, or in some cases even a sixteenth per cent. less than
he offers in the same breath to sell them at. If there are two securities equally good, but one of them belongs to a large issue of bonds, and the other to a small issue by the
same government, so that the first is constantly coming on the market, and the latter
but seldom, then the dealers will on this account alone require a larger margin
between their selling price and their buying price in the latter case than in the former5
. This illustrates well the great law, that the larger the market for a commodity the
smaller generally are the fluctuations in its price, and the lower is the percentage on
the turnover which dealers charge for doing business in it.

Stock exchanges then are the pattern on which markets have been, and are being
formed for dealing in many kinds of produce which can be easily and exactly
described, are portable and in general demand. The material commodities however
which possess these qualities in the highest degree are gold and silver. For that very
reason they have been chosen by common consent for use as money, to represent the
value of other things: the world market for them is most highly organized, and will be
found to offer many subtle illustrations of the actions of the laws which we are now
discussing.

§ 5. At the opposite extremity to international stock exchange securities and the more
valuable metals are, firstly, things which must be made to order to suit particular
individuals, such as well-fitting clothes; and, secondly, perishable and bulky goods,
such as fresh vegetables, which can seldom be profitably carried long distances. The
first can scarcely be said to have a wholesale market at all; the conditions by which
their price is determined are those of retail buying and selling, and the study of them
may be postponed6 .

There are indeed wholesale markets for the second class, but they are confined within
narrow boundaries; we may find our typical instance in the sale of the commoner
kinds of vegetables in a country town. The market-gardeners in the neighbourhood
have probably to arrange for the sale of their vegetables to the townspeople with but
little external interference on either side. There may be some check to extreme prices
by the power on the one side of selling, and on the other of buying elsewhere; but
under ordinary circumstances the check is inoperative, and it may happen that the
dealers in such a case are able to combine, and thus fix an artificial monopoly price;
that is, a price determined with little direct reference to cost of production, but chiefly
by a consideration of what the market will bear.

Some of the market-gardeners:
- are almost equally near a second country town
- send their vegetables now to one and now to the other

Some people who occasionally buy in the first town may have equally good access to the second.

The least variation in price will lead them to prefer the better market; and thus make the bargainings in the two towns to some extent
mutually dependent. It may happen that this second town is in close communication
with London or some other central market, so that its prices are controlled by the
prices in the central market; and in that case prices in our first town also must move to
a considerable extent in harmony with them. 

As news passes from mouth to mouth till a rumour spreads far away from its forgotten sources, so even the most secluded market is liable to be influenced by changes of which those in the market have no direct cognizance, changes that have had their origin far away and have spread gradually from market to market.

Thus at the one extreme are world markets in which competition acts directly from all
parts of the globe; and at the other those secluded markets in which all direct
competition from afar is shut out, though indirect and transmitted competition may
make itself felt even in these; and about midway between these extremes lie the great
majority of the markets which the economist and the business man have to study.

§ 6. Markets vary with regard to the period of time which is allowed to the forces of demand and supply to bring themselves into equilibrium with one another,
as well as with regard to the area over which they extend. And this element of Time
requires more careful attention just now than does that of Space. For the nature of the
equilibrium itself, and that of the causes by which it is determined, depend on the
length of the period over which the market is taken to extend. We shall find that if the
period is short, the supply is limited to the stores which happen to be at hand: if the
period is longer, the supply will be influenced, more or less, by the cost of producing
the commodity in question; and if the period is very long, this cost will in its turn be
influenced, more or less, by the cost of producing the labour and the material things
required for producing the commodity. These three classes of course merge into one
another by imperceptible degrees. We will begin with the first class; and consider in
the next chapter those temporary equilibria of demand and supply, in which "supply"
means in effect merely the stock available at the time for sale in the market; so that it
cannot be directly influenced by the cost of production.
