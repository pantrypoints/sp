§ 4. I am:
- investigating the equilibrium of normal demand and normal supply in their most general form
- neglecting those features which are special to particular parts of economic science
- confining my attention to those broad relations which are common to nearly the whole of it

Thus, I assume that:
- the forces of demand and supply have free play
- there is no close combination among dealers on either side
- each acts for himself
- there is much free competition
- buyers compete freely with buyers
- sellers compete freely with sellers

But though everyone acts for himself, his knowledge of what others are doing is supposed to be generally sufficient to prevent him from taking a lower or paying a higher price than others are doing. 

I assumed this to be true both of finished goods and of their factors of production, of the hire of labour and of the borrowing of capital. 

I assume that there is only one price in the market at one and the same time, it being understood that separate allowance is made, when necessary, for differences in the expense of delivering goods to dealers in different parts of the market; including allowance for the special expenses of retailing, if it is a retail market. 

In such a market there is a demand price for each amount of the commodity, that is, a price at which each particular amount of the commodity can find purchasers in a day
or week or year. The circumstances which govern this price for any given amount of the commodity vary in character from one problem to another; but in every case the
more of a thing is offered for sale in a market the lower is the price at which it will
find purchasers; or in other words, the demand price for each bushel or yard
diminishes with every increase in the amount offered.

The unit of time may be chosen according to the circumstances of each particular
problem: it may be a day, a month, a year, or even a generation: but in every case it
must be short relatively to the period of the market under discussion. It is to be
assumed that the general circumstances of the market remain unchanged throughout
this period; that there is, for instance, no change in fashion or taste, no new substitute
which might affect the demand, no new invention to disturb the supply.
The conditions of normal supply are less definite; and a full study of them must be
reserved for later chapters. They will be found to vary in detail with the length of the
period of time to which the investigation refers; chiefly because both the material
capital of machinery and other business plant, and the immaterial capital of business
skill and ability and organization, are of slow growth and slow decay.

Let us call to mind the "representative firm," whose economies of production, internal
and external, are dependent on the aggregate volume of production of the commodity
that it makes14 ; and, postponing all further study of the nature of this dependence, let
us assume that the normal supply price of any amount of that commodity may be
taken to be its normal expenses of production (including gross earnings of
management15 ) by that firm. That is, let us assume that this is the price the
expectation of which will just suffice to maintain the existing aggregate amount of
production; some firms meanwhile rising and increasing their output, and others
falling and diminishing theirs; but the aggregate production remaining unchanged. A
price higher than this would increase the growth of the rising firms, and slacken,
though it might not arrest, the decay of the falling firms; with the net result of an
increase in the aggregate production. On the other hand, a price lower than this would
hasten the decay of the falling firms, and slacken the growth of the rising firms; and
on the whole diminish production: and a rise or fall of price would affect in like
manner though perhaps not in an equal degree those great joint-stock companies
which often stagnate, but seldom die.

§ 5. To give definiteness to our ideas let us take an illustration from the woollen trade.
Let us suppose that a person well acquainted with the woollen trade sets himself to
inquire what would be the normal supply price of a certain number of millions of
yards annually of a particular kind of cloth. He would have to reckon (i) the price of
the wool, coal, and other materials which would be used up in making it, (ii) wear-
and-tear and depreciation of the buildings, machinery and other fixed capital, (iii)
interest and insurance on all the capital, (iv) the wages of those who work in the
factories, and (v) the gross earnings of management (including insurance against
loss), of those who undertake the risks, who engineer and superintend the working. He
would of course estimate the supply prices of all these different factors of production
of the cloth with reference to the amounts of each of them that would be wanted, and
on the supposition that the conditions of supply would be normal; and he would add
them all together to find the supply price of the cloth.
Let us suppose a list of supply prices (or a supply schedule) made on a similar plan to
that of our list of demand prices16 : the supply price of each amount of the
commodity in a year, or any other unit of time, being written against that amount17 .
As the flow, or (annual) amount of the commodity increases, the supply price may either increase or diminish; or it may even alternately increase and diminish. 

For if
nature is offering a sturdy resistance to man's efforts to wring from her a larger supply
of raw material, while at that particular stage there is no great room for introducing
important new economies into the manufacture, the supply price will rise; but if the
volume of production were greater, it would perhaps be profitable to substitute largely
machine work for hand work and steam power for muscular force; and the increase in
the volume of production would have diminished the expenses of production of the
commodity of our representative firm. But those cases in which the supply price falls
as the amount increases involve special difficulties of their own; and they are
postponed to chapter XII. of this Book.

§ 6. When therefore the amount produced (in a unit of time) is such that the demand
price is greater than the supply price, then sellers receive more than is sufficient to
make it worth their while to bring goods to market to that amount; and there is at
work an active force tending to increase the amount brought forward for sale. On the
other hand, when the amount produced is such that the demand price is less than the
supply price, sellers receive less than is sufficient to make it worth their while to bring
goods to market on that scale; so that those who were just on the margin of doubt as to
whether to go on producing are decided not to do so, and there is an active force at
work tending to diminish the amount brought forward for sale. When the demand
price is equal to the supply price, the amount produced has no tendency either to be
increased or to be diminished; it is in equilibrium.

When demand and supply are in equilibrium, the amount of the commodity which is
being produced in a unit of time may be called the equilibrium-amount, and the price
at which it is being sold may be called the equilibrium-price.

Such an equilibrium is stable; that is, the price, if displaced a little from it, will tend to
return, as a pendulum oscillates about its lowest point; and it will be found to be a
characteristic of stable equilibria that in them the demand price is greater than the
supply price for amounts just less than the equilibrium amount, and vice versâ. For
when the demand price is greater than the supply price, the amount produced tends to
increase. Therefore, if the demand price is greater than the supply price for amounts
just less than an equilibrium amount; then, if the scale of production is temporarily
diminished somewhat below that equilibrium amount, it will tend to return; thus the
equilibrium is stable for displacements in that direction. If the demand price is greater
than the supply price for amounts just less than the equilibrium amount, it is sure to be
less than the supply price for amounts just greater: and therefore, if the scale of
production is somewhat increased beyond the equilibrium position, it will tend to
return; and the equilibrium will be stable for displacements in that direction also.
When demand and supply are in stable equilibrium, if any accident should move the
scale of production from its equilibrium position, there will be instantly brought into
play forces tending to push it back to that position; just as, if a stone hanging by a
string is displaced from its equilibrium position, the force of gravity will at once tend
to bring it back to its equilibrium position. The movements of the scale of production
about its position of equilibrium will be of a somewhat similar kind.

But in real life such oscillations are seldom as rhythmical as those of a stone hanging
freely from a string; the comparison would be more exact if the string were supposed
to hang in the troubled waters of a mill-race, whose stream was at one time allowed to
flow freely, and at another partially cut off. Nor are these complexities sufficient to
illustrate all the disturbances with which the economist and the merchant alike are
forced to concern themselves. If the person holding the string swings his hand with
movements partly rhythmical and partly arbitrary, the illustration will not outrun the
difficulties of some very real and practical problems of value. For indeed the demand
and supply schedules do not in practice remain unchanged for a long time together,
but are constantly being changed; and every change in them alters the equilibrium
amount and the equilibrium price, and thus gives new positions to the centres about
which the amount and the price tend to oscillate.

These considerations point to the great importance of the element of time in relation
to demand and supply, to the study of which we now proceed. We shall gradually
discover a great many different limitations of the doctrine that the price at which a
thing can be produced represents its real cost of production, that is, the efforts and
sacrifices which have been directly and indirectly devoted to its production. For, in an
age of rapid change such as this, the equilibrium of normal demand and supply does
not thus correspond to any distinct relation of a certain aggregate of pleasures got
from the consumption of the commodity and an aggregate of efforts and sacrifices
involved in producing it: the correspondence would not be exact, even if normal
earnings and interest were exact measures of the efforts and sacrifices for which they
are the money payments. This is the real drift of that much quoted, and much-
misunderstood doctrine of Adam Smith and other economists that the normal, or
"natural," value of a commodity is that which economic forces tend to bring about in
the long run. It is the average value which economic forces would bring about if the
general conditions of life were stationary for a run of time long enough to enable them
all to work out their full effect20 .

But we cannot foresee the future perfectly. The unexpected may happen; and the
existing tendencies may be modified before they have had time to accomplish what
appears now to be their full and complete work. The fact that the general conditions of
life are not stationary is the source of many of the difficulties that are met with in
applying economic doctrines to practical problems.
Of course Normal does not mean Competitive. Market prices and Normal prices are
alike brought about by a multitude of influences, of which some rest on a moral basis and some on a physical; of which some are competitive and some are not. It is to the
persistence of the influences considered, and the time allowed for them to work out
their effects that we refer when contrasting Market and Normal price, and again when
contrasting the narrower and the broader use of the term Normal price21 .
§ 7. The remainder of the present volume will be chiefly occupied with interpreting
and limiting this doctrine that the value of a thing tends in the long run to correspond
to its cost of production. In particular the notion of equilibrium, which has been
treated rather slightly in this chapter, will be studied more carefully in chapters V. and
XII. of this Book: and some account of the controversy whether "cost of production"
or "utility" governs value will be given in Appendix I. But it may be well to say a
word or two here on this last point.

We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of
scissors that cuts a piece of paper, as whether value is governed by utility or cost of
production. It is true that when one blade is held still, and the cutting is effected by
moving the other, we may say with careless brevity that the cutting is done by the
second; but the statement is not strictly accurate, and is to be excused only so long as
it claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account of what happens.
In the same way, when a thing already made has to be sold, the price which people
will be willing to pay for it will be governed by their desire to have it, together with
the amount they can afford to spend on it. Their desire to have it depends partly on the
chance that, if they do not buy it, they will be able to get another thing like it at as low
a price: this depends on the causes that govern the supply of it, and this again upon
cost of production. But it may so happen that the stock to be sold is practically fixed.
This, for instance, is the case with a fish market, in which the value of fish for the day
is governed almost exclusively by the stock on the slabs in relation to the demand:
and if a person chooses to take the stock for granted, and say that the price is
governed by demand, his brevity may perhaps be excused so long as he does not
claim strict accuracy. So again it may be pardonable, but it is not strictly accurate to
say that the varying prices which the same rare book fetches, when sold and resold at
Christie's auction room, are governed exclusively by demand.

Taking a case at the opposite extreme, we find some commodities which conform
pretty closely to the law of constant return; that is to say, their average cost of
production will be very nearly the same whether they are produced in small quantities
or in large. In such a case the normal level about which the market price fluctuates
will be this definite and fixed (money) cost of production. If the demand happens to
be great, the market price will rise for a time above the level; but as a result
production will increase and the market price will fall: and conversely, if the demand
falls for a time below its ordinary level.

In such a case, if a person chooses to neglect market fluctuations, and to take it for
granted that there will anyhow be enough demand for the commodity to insure that
some of it, more or less, will find purchasers at a price equal to this cost of
production, then he may be excused for ignoring the influence of demand, and
speaking of (normal) price as governed by cost of production—provided only he does not claim scientific accuracy for the wording of his doctrine, and explains the
influence of demand in its right place.

Thus we may conclude that, as a general rule, the shorter the period which we are
considering, the greater must be the share of our attention which is given to the
influence of demand on value; and the longer the period, the more important will be
the influence of cost of production on value. For the influence of changes in cost of
production takes as a rule a longer time to work itself out than does the influence of
changes in demand. The actual value at any time, the market value as it is often
called, is often more influenced by passing events and by causes whose action is fitful
and short lived, than by those which work persistently. But in long periods these fitful
and irregular causes in large measure efface one another's influence; so that in the
long run persistent causes dominate value completely. Even the most persistent causes
are however liable to change. For the whole structure of production is modified, and
the relative costs of production of different things are permanently altered, from one
generation to another.

When considering costs from the point of view of the capitalist employer, we of
course measure them in money; because his direct concern with the efforts needed for
the work of his employees lies in the money payments he must make. His concern
with the real costs of their effort and of the training required for it is only indirect,
though a monetary assessment of his own labour is necessary for some problems, as
will be seen later on. But when considering costs from the social point of view, when
inquiring whether the cost of attaining a given result is increasing or diminishing with
changing economic conditions, then we are concerned with the real costs of efforts of
various qualities, and with the real cost of waiting. If the purchasing power of money,
in terms of effort has remained about constant, and if the rate of remuneration for
waiting has remained about constant, then the money measure of costs corresponds to
the real costs: but such a correspondence is never to be assumed lightly. These
considerations will generally suffice for the interpretation of the term Cost in what
follows, even where no distinct indication is given in the context.
