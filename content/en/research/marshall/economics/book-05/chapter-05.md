§ 1. The variations in the scope of the term Normal, according as the periods of time under discussion are long or short, were indicated in Chapter III. We are now ready to
study them more closely. 

In this case, as in others, the economist merely brings to light difficulties that are
latent in the common discourse of life, so that by being frankly faced they may be
thoroughly overcome. For in ordinary life it is customary to use the word Normal in
different senses, with reference to different periods of time; and to leave the context to
explain the transition from one to another. The economist follows this practice of
every-day life: but, by taking pains to indicate the transition, he sometimes seems to
have created a complication which in fact he has only revealed.

Thus, when it is said that the price of wool on a certain day was abnormally high
though the average price for the year was abnormally low, that the wages of coal-
miners were abnormally high in 1872 and abnormally low in 1879, that the (real)
wages of labour were abnormally high at the end of the fourteenth century and
abnormally low in the middle of the sixteenth; everyone understands that the scope of
the term normal is not the same in these various cases.

The best illustrations of this come from manufactures where the plant is long-lived,
and the product is short-lived. When a new textile fabric is first introduced into
favour, and there is very little plant suitable for making it, its normal price for some
months may be twice as high as those of other fabrics which are not less difficult to
make, but for making which there is an abundant stock of suitable plant and skill.
Looking at long periods we may say that its normal price is on a par with that of the
others: but if during the first few months a good deal of it were offered for sale in a
bankrupt's stock we might say that its price was abnormally low even when it was
selling for half as much again as the others. Everyone takes the context as indicating
the special use of the term in each several case; and a formal interpretation clause is
seldom necessary, because in ordinary conversation misunderstandings can be nipped
in the bud by question and answer. But let us look at this matter more closely.
We have noticed33 how a cloth manufacturer would need to calculate the expenses of
producing all the different things required for making cloth with reference to the
amounts of each of them that would be wanted; and on the supposition in the first
instance that the conditions of supply would be normal. But we have yet to take
account of the fact that he must give to this term a wider or narrower range, according
as he was looking more or less far ahead.

Thus in estimating the wages required to call forth an adequate supply of labour to
work a certain class of looms, he might take the current wages of similar work in the
neighbourhood: or he might argue that there was a scarcity of that particular class of
labour in the neighbourhood, that its current wages there were higher than in other
parts of England, and that looking forward over several years so as to allow for
immigration, he might take the normal rate of wages at a rather lower rate than that
prevailing there at the time. Or lastly, he might think that the wages of weavers all
over the country were abnormally low relatively to others of the same grade, in
consequence of a too sanguine view having been taken of the prospects of the trade
half a generation ago. He might argue that this branch of work was overcrowded, that
parents had already begun to choose other trades for their children which offered
greater net advantages and yet were not more difficult; that in consequence a few
years would see a falling-off in the supply of labour suited for his purpose; so that
looking forward a long time he must take normal wages at a rate rather higher than the
present average34 .

Again, in estimating the normal supply price of wool, he would take the average of
several past years. He would make allowance for any change that would be likely to
affect the supply in the immediate future; and he would reckon for the effect of such
droughts as from time to time occur in Australia and elsewhere; since their occurrence
is too common to be regarded as abnormal. But he would not allow here for the
chance of our being involved in a great war, by which the Australian supplies might
be cut off; he would consider that any allowance for this should come under the head
of extraordinary trade risks, and not enter into his estimate of the normal supply price
of wool.

He would deal in the same way with the risk of civil tumult or any violent and long-
continued disturbance of the labour market of an unusual character; but in his estimate
of the amount of work that could be got out of the machinery, etc. under normal
conditions, he would probably reckon for minor interruptions from trade disputes such
as are continually occurring, and are therefore to be regarded as belonging to the
regular course of events, that is as not abnormal.
In all these calculations he would not concern himself specially to inquire how far
mankind are under the exclusive influence of selfish or self-regarding motives. He
might be aware that anger and vanity, jealousy and offended dignity are still almost as
common causes of strikes and lockouts, as the desire for pecuniary gain: but that
would not enter into his calculations. All that he would want to know about them
would be whether they acted with sufficient regularity for him to be able to make a
reasonably good allowance for their influence in interrupting work and raising the
normal supply price of the goods35 .

§ 2. The element of time is a chief cause of those difficulties in economic
investigations which make it necessary for man with his limited powers to go step by
step; breaking up a complex question, studying one bit at a time, and at last
combining his partial solutions into a more or less complete solution of the whole
riddle. In breaking it up, he segregates those disturbing causes, whose wanderings
happen to be inconvenient, for the time in a pound called Cœteris Paribus. The study of some group of tendencies is isolated by the assumption other things being equal:
the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected
for a time. The more the issue is thus narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled:
but also the less closely does it correspond to real life. Each exact and firm handling
of a narrow issue, however, helps towards treating broader issues, in which that
narrow issue is contained, more exactly than would otherwise have been possible.
With each step more things can be let out of the pound; exact discussions can be made
less abstract, realistic discussions can be made less inexact than was possible at an
earlier stage36 .

Our first step towards studying the influences exerted by the element of time on the
relations between cost of production and value may well be to consider the famous
fiction of the "Stationary state" in which those influences would be but little felt; and
to contrast the results which would be found there with those in the modern world.
This state obtains its name from the fact that in it the general conditions of production
and consumption, of distribution and exchange remain motionless; but yet it is full of
movement; for it is a mode of life. The average age of the population may be
stationary; though each individual is growing up from youth towards his prime, or
downwards to old age. And the same amount of things per head of the population will
have been produced in the same ways by the same classes of people for many
generations together; and therefore this supply of the appliances for production will
have had full time to be adjusted to the steady demand.

Of course we might assume that in our stationary state every business remained
always of the same size, and with the same trade connection. But we need not go so
far as that; it will suffice to suppose that firms rise and fall, but that the
"representative" firm remains always of about the same size, as does the
representative tree of a virgin forest, and that therefore the economies resulting from
its own resources are constant: and since the aggregate volume of production is
constant, so also are those economies resulting from subsidiary industries in the
neighbourhood, etc. [That is, its internal and external economies are both constant.
The price, the expectation of which just induced persons to enter the trade, must be
sufficient to cover in the long run the cost of building up a trade connection; and a
proportionate share of it must be added in to make up the total cost of production.]
In a stationary state then the plain rule would be that cost of production governs value.
Each effect would be attributable mainly to one cause; there would not be much
complex action and reaction between cause and effect. Each element of cost would be
governed by "natural" laws, subject to some control from fixed custom. There would
be no reflex influence of demand; no fundamental difference between the immediate
and the later effects of economic causes. There would be no distinction between long-
period and short-period normal value, at all events if we supposed that in that
monotonous world the harvests themselves were uniform: for the representative firm
being always of the same size, and always doing the same class of business to the
same extent and in the same way, with no slack times, and no specially busy times, its
normal expenses by which the normal supply price is governed would be always the same. The demand lists of prices would always be the same, and so would the supply
lists; and normal price would never vary.

But nothing of this is true in the world in which we live. Here every economic force is
constantly changing its action, under the influence of other forces which are acting
around it. Here changes in the volume of production, in its methods, and in its cost are
ever mutually modifying one another; they are always affecting and being affected by
the character and the extent of demand. Further all these mutual influences take time
to work themselves out, and, as a rule, no two influences move at equal pace. In this
world therefore every plain and simple doctrine as to the relations between cost of
production, demand and value is necessarily false: and the greater the appearance of
lucidity which is given to it by skilful exposition, the more mischievous it is. A man is
likely to be a better economist if he trusts to his common sense, and practical
instincts, than if he professes to study the theory of value and is resolved to find it
easy.
