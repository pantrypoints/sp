§ 3. The Stationary state has just been taken to be one in which population is stationary. 

But nearly all its distinctive features may be exhibited in a place where
population and wealth are both growing, provided they are growing at about the same
rate, and there is no scarcity of land: and provided also the methods of production and
the conditions of trade change but little; and above all, where the character of man
himself is a constant quantity. For in such a state by far the most important conditions
of production and consumption, of exchange and distribution will remain of the same
quality, and in the same general relations to one another, though they are all
increasing in volume37 .

This relaxation of the rigid bonds of a purely stationary state brings us one step nearer
to the actual conditions of life: and by relaxing them still further we get nearer still.
We thus approach by gradual steps towards the difficult problem of the interaction of
countless economic causes. In the stationary state all the conditions of production and
consumption are reduced to rest: but less violent assumptions are made by what is, not
quite accurately, called the statical method. By that method we fix our minds on some
central point: we suppose it for the time to be reduced to a stationary state; and we
then study in relation to it the forces that affect the things by which it is surrounded,
and any tendency there may be to equilibrium of these forces. A number of these
partial studies may lead the way towards a solution of problems too difficult to be
grasped at one effort38 .


§ 4. We may roughly classify problems connected with fishing industries as those which are affected by very quick changes, such as uncertainties of the weather; or by
changes of moderate length, such as the increased demand for fish caused by the scarcity of meat during the year or two following a cattle plague; or lastly, we may
consider the great increase during a whole generation of the demand for fish which
might result from the rapid growth of a high-strung artisan population making little
use of their muscles.

The day to day oscillations of the price of fish resulting from uncertainties of the
weather, etc., are governed by practically the same causes in modern England as in the supposed stationary state. The changes in the general economic conditions around
us are quick; but they are not quick enough to affect perceptibly the short-period
normal level about which the price fluctuates from day to day: and they may be
neglected [impounded in cœteris paribus] during a study of such fluctuations.

Let us then pass on; and suppose a great increase in the general demand for fish, such
for instance as might arise from a disease affecting farm stock, by which meat was
made a dear and dangerous food for several years together. We now impound
fluctuations due to the weather in cœteris paribus, and neglect them provisionally:
they are so quick that they speedily obliterate one another, and are therefore not
important for problems of this class. And for the opposite reason we neglect variations
in the numbers of those who are brought up as seafaring men: for these variations are
too slow to produce much effect in the year or two during which the scarcity of meat
lasts. Having impounded these two sets for the time, we give our full attention to such
influences as the inducements which good fishing wages will offer to sailors to stay in
their fishing homes for a year or two, instead of applying for work on a ship. 

We consider what old fishing boats, and even vessels that were not specially made for
fishing, can be adapted and sent to fish for a year or two. The normal price for any
given daily supply of fish, which we are now seeking, is the price which will quickly
call into the fishing trade capital and labour enough to obtain that supply in a day's
fishing of average good fortune; the influence which the price of fish will have upon
capital and labour available in the fishing trade being governed by rather narrow
causes such as these. This new level about which the price oscillates during these
years of exceptionally great demand, will obviously be higher than before. Here we
see an illustration of the almost universal law that the term Normal being taken to
refer to a short period of time an increase in the amount demanded raises the normal
supply price. This law is almost universal even as regards industries which in long
periods follow the tendency to increasing return39 .

But if we turn to consider the normal supply price with reference to a long period of
time, we shall find that it is governed by a different set of causes, and with different
results. For suppose that the disuse of meat causes a permanent distaste for it, and that
an increased demand for fish continues long enough to enable the forces by which its
supply is governed to work out their action fully (of course oscillation from day to
day and from year to year would continue: but we may leave them on one side). The
source of supply in the sea might perhaps show signs of exhaustion, and the fishermen
might have to resort to more distant coasts and to deeper waters, Nature giving a
Diminishing Return to the increased application of capital and labour of a given order
of efficiency. On the other hand, those might turn out to be right who think that man
is responsible for but a very small part of the destruction of fish that is constantly
going on; and in that case a boat starting with equally good appliances and an equally
efficient crew would be likely to get nearly as good a haul after the increase in the
total volume of the fishing trade as before. In any case the normal cost of equipping a
good boat with an efficient crew would certainly not be higher, and probably be a
little lower after the trade had settled down to its now increased dimensions than
before. For since fishermen require only trained aptitudes, and not any exceptional
natural qualities, their number could be increased in less than a generation to almost
any extent that was necessary to meet the demand; while the industries connected with building boats, making nets, etc. being now on a larger scale would be organized
more thoroughly and economically. If therefore the waters of the sea showed no signs
of depletion of fish, an increased supply could be produced at a lower price after a
time sufficiently long to enable the normal action of economic causes to work itself
out: and, the term Normal being taken to refer to a long period of time, the normal
price of fish would decrease with an increase in demand40 .

Thus we may emphasize the distinction already made between average price and
normal price. An average may be taken of the prices of any set of sales extending over
a day or a week or a year or any other time: or it may be the average of sales at any
time in many markets; or it may be the average of many such averages. But the
conditions which are normal to any one set of sales are not likely to be exactly those
which are normal to the others: and therefore it is only by accident that an average
price will be a normal price; that is, the price which any one set of conditions tends to
produce. In a stationary state alone, as we have just seen, the term normal always
means the same thing: there, but only there, "average price" and "normal price" are
convertible terms41 .

§ 5. To go over the ground in another way. Market values are governed by the relation
of demand to stocks actually in the market; with more or less reference to "future"
supplies, and not without some influence of trade combinations.

But the current supply is in itself partly due to the action of producers in the past; and
this action has been determined on as the result of a comparison of the prices which
they expect to get for their goods with the expenses to which they will be put in
producing them. The range of expenses of which they take account depends on
whether they are merely considering the extra expenses of certain extra production
with their existing plant, or are considering whether to lay down new plant for the
purpose. In the case, for instance, of an order for a single locomotive, which was
discussed a little while ago42 , the question of readjusting the plant to demand would
hardly arise: the main question would be whether more work could conveniently be
got out of the existing plant. But in view of an order for a large number of
locomotives to be delivered gradually over a series of years, some extension of plant
"specially" made for the purpose, and therefore truly to be regarded as prime marginal
costs would almost certainly be carefully considered.

Whether the new production for which there appears to be a market be large or small,
the general rule will be that unless the price is expected to be very low that portion of
the supply which can be most easily produced, with but small prime costs, will be
produced: that portion is not likely to be on the margin of production. As the
expectations of price improve, an increased part of the production will yield a
considerable surplus above prime costs, and the margin of production will be pushed
outwards. Every increase in the price expected will, as a rule, induce some people
who would not otherwise have produced anything, to produce a little; and those, who
have produced something for the lower price, will produce more for the higher price.
That part of their production with regard to which such persons are on the margin of
doubt as to whether it is worth while for them to produce it at the price, is to be
included together with that of the persons who are in doubt whether to produce at all; the two together constitute the marginal production at that price. The producers, who
are in doubt whether to produce anything at all, may be said to lie altogether on the
margin of production (or, if they are agriculturists, on the margin of cultivation). But
as a rule they are very few in number, and their action is less important than that of
those who would in any case produce something.

The general drift of the term normal supply price is always the same whether the
period to which it refers is short or long; but there are great differences in detail. In
every case reference is made to a certain given rate of aggregate production; that is, to
the production of a certain aggregate amount daily or annually. In every case the price
is that the expectation of which is sufficient and only just sufficient to make it worth
while for people to set themselves to produce that aggregate amount; in every case the
cost of production is marginal; that is, it is the cost of production of those goods
which are on the margin of not being produced at all, and which would not be
produced if the price to be got for them were expected to be lower. But the causes
which determine this margin vary with the length of the period under consideration.
For short periods people take the stock of appliances for production as practically
fixed; and they are governed by their expectations of demand in considering how
actively they shall set themselves to work those appliances. In long periods they set
themselves to adjust the flow of these appliances to their expectations of demand for
the goods which the appliances help to produce. Let us examine this difference
closely.

§ 6. The immediate effect of the expectation of a high price is to cause people to bring
into active work all their appliances of production, and to work them full time and
perhaps overtime. The supply price is then the money cost of production of that part
of the produce which forces the undertaker to hire such inefficient labour (perhaps
tired by working overtime) at so high a price, and to put himself and others to so
much strain and inconvenience that he is on the margin of doubt whether it is worth
his while to do it or not. The immediate effect of the expectation of a low price is to
throw many appliances for production out of work, and slacken the work of others;
and if the producers had no fear of spoiling their markets, it would be worth their
while to produce for a time for any price that covered the prime costs of production
and rewarded them for their own trouble.

But, as it is, they generally hold out for a higher price; each man fears to spoil his
chance of getting a better price later on from his own customers; or, if he produces for
a large and open market, he is more or less in fear of incurring the resentment of other
producers, should he sell needlessly at a price that spoils the common market for all.
The marginal production in this case is the production of those whom a little further
fall of price would cause, either from a regard to their own interest or by formal or
informal agreement with other producers, to suspend production for fear of further
spoiling the market. The price which, for these reasons, producers are just on the point
of refusing, is the true marginal supply price for short periods. It is nearly always
above, and generally very much above the special or prime cost for raw materials,
labour and wear-and-tear of plant, which is immediately and directly involved by
getting a little further use out of appliances which are not fully employed. This point
needs further study.

In a trade which uses very expensive plant, the prime cost of goods is but a small part
of their total cost; and an order at much less than their normal price may leave a large
surplus above their prime cost. But if producers accept such orders in their anxiety to
prevent their plant from being idle, they glut the market and tend to prevent prices
from reviving. In fact however they seldom pursue this policy constantly and without
moderation. If they did, they might ruin many of those in the trade, themselves
perhaps among the number; and in that case a revival of demand would find little
response in supply, and would raise violently the prices of the goods produced by the
trade. Extreme variations of this kind are in the long run beneficial neither to
producers nor to consumers; and general opinion is not altogether hostile to that code
of trade morality which condemns the action of anyone who "spoils the market" by
being too ready to accept a price that does little more than cover the prime cost of his
goods, and allows but little on account of his general expenses43 .

For example, if at any time the prime cost, in the narrowest sense of the word, of a
bale of cloth is £100; and if another £100 are needed to make the cloth pay its due
share of the general expenses of the establishment, including normal profits to its
owners, then the practically effective supply price is perhaps not very likely to fall
below £150 under ordinary conditions, even for short periods; though of course a few
special bargains may be made at lower prices without much affecting the general
market.

Thus, although nothing but prime cost enters necessarily and directly into the supply
price for short periods, it is yet true that supplementary costs also exert some
influence indirectly. A producer does not often isolate the cost of each separate small
parcel of his output; he is apt to treat a considerable part of it, even in some cases the
whole of it, more or less as a unit. He inquires whether it is worth his while to add a
certain new line to his present undertakings, whether it is worth while to introduce a
new machine and so on. He treats the extra output that would result from the change
more or less as a unit beforehand; and afterwards he quotes the lowest prices, which
he is willing to accept, with more or less reference to the whole cost of that extra
output regarded as a unit.

In other words he regards an increase in his processes of production, rather than an
individual parcel of his products, as a unit in most of his transactions. And the
analytical economist must follow suit, if he would keep in close touch with actual
conditions. These considerations tend to blur the sharpness of outline of the theory of
value: but they do not affect its substance.

To sum up then as regards short periods. The supply of specialized skill and ability, of
suitable machinery and other material capital, and of the appropriate industrial
organization has not time to be fully adapted to demand; but the producers have to
adjust their supply to the demand as best they can with the appliances already at their
disposal. On the one hand there is not time materially to increase those appliances if
the supply of them is deficient; and on the other, if the supply is excessive, some of
them must remain imperfectly employed, since there is not time for the supply to be
much reduced by gradual decay, and by conversion to other uses. 

Variations in the
particular income derived from them do not for the time affect perceptibly the supply; and do not directly affect the price of the commodities produced by them. The income
is a surplus of total receipts over prime cost; [that is, it has something of the nature of
a rent as will be seen more clearly in chapter VIII.]. But unless it is sufficient to cover
in the long run a fair share of the general costs of the business, production will
gradually fall off. In this way a controlling influence over the relatively quick
movements of supply price during short periods is exercised by causes in the
background which range over a long period; and the fear of "spoiling the market"
often makes those causes act more promptly than they otherwise would.


§ 7. In long periods on the other hand all investments of capital and effort in providing the material plant and the organization of a business, and in acquiring trade
knowledge and specialized ability, have time to be adjusted to the incomes which are expected to be earned by them: and the estimates of those incomes therefore directly
govern supply, and are the true long-period normal supply price of the commodities
produced.

A great part of the capital invested in a business is generally spent on building up its internal organization and its external trade connections.

If the business does not prosper all that capital is lost, even though its material plant may realize a considerable part of its original cost. And anyone proposing to start a new business in any trade must reckon for the chance of this loss. If himself a man of normal capacity for that class of work, he may look forward ere long to his business being a
representative one, in the sense in which we have used this term, with its fair share of the economies of production on a large scale. If the net earnings of such a
representative business seem likely to be greater than he could get by similar investments in other trades to which he has access, he will choose this trade. Thus that
investment of capital in a trade, on which the price of the commodity produced by it depends in the long run, is governed by estimates on the one hand of the outgoings
required to build up and to work a representative firm, and on the other of the
incomings, spread over a long period of time, to be got by such a price.

At any particular moment some businesses will be rising and others falling: but when we are taking a broad view of the causes which govern normal supply price, we need
not trouble ourselves with these eddies on the surface of the great tide. 

Any particular
increase of production may be due to some new manufacturer who is struggling
against difficulties, working with insufficient capital, and enduring great privations in
the hope that he may gradually build up a good business. Or it may be due to some
wealthy firm which by enlarging its premises is enabled to attain new economies, and
thus obtain a larger output at a lower proportionate cost: and, as this additional output
will be small relatively to the aggregate volume of production in the trade, it will not
much lower the price; so that the firm will reap great gains from its successful
adaptation to its surroundings. But while these variations are occurring in the fortunes
of individual businesses, there may be a steady tendency of the long-period normal
supply price to diminish, as a direct consequence of an increase in the aggregate
volume of production.

§ 8. There is no hard and sharp line of division between "long" and "short" periods.

Nature has drawn no such lines in the economic conditions of actual life; and in dealing with practical problems they are not wanted. Just as we contrast civilized
with uncivilized races, and establish many general propositions about either group, though no hard and fast division can be drawn between the two; so we contrast long
and short periods without attempting any rigid demarcation between them. 

If it is necessary for the purposes of any particular argument to divide one case sharply from
the other, it can be done by a special interpretation clause: but the occasions on which
this is necessary are neither frequent nor important.

Four classes stand out. In each, price is governed by the relations between demand
and supply. As regards market prices, Supply is taken to mean the stock of the
commodity in question which is on hand, or at all events "in sight." As regards
normal prices, when the term Normal is taken to relate to short periods of a few
months or a year, Supply means broadly what can be produced for the price in
question with the existing stock of plant, personal and impersonal, in the given time.

As regards normal prices, when the term Normal is to refer to long periods of several
years, Supply means what can be produced by plant, which itself can be remuneratively produced and applied within the given time; while lastly, there are
very gradual or Secular movements of normal price, caused by the gradual growth of
knowledge, of population and of capital, and the changing conditions of demand and
supply from one generation to another45 .

The remainder of the present volume is chiefly concerned with the third of the above
classes: that is, with the normal relations of wages, profits, prices, etc., for rather long
periods. But occasionally account has to be taken of changes that extend over very
many years; and one chapter, Book VI. ch. XII., is given up to "The Influence of
Progress on Value," that is, to the study of secular changes of value.
