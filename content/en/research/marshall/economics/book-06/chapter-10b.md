§ 5. The position of a peasant proprietor has great attractions. He is free to do what he
likes, he is not worried by the interference of a landlord, and the anxiety lest another
should reap the fruits of his work and self-denial. His feeling of ownership gives him
self-respect, and stability of character, and makes him provident and temperate in his
habits. He is scarcely ever idle, and seldom regards his work as mere drudgery; it is
all for the land that he loves so well.

"The magic of property turns sand into gold," said Arthur Young. It undoubtedly has
done so in many cases in which the proprietors have been men of exceptional energy.
But such men might perhaps have done as well or better if their horizon had not been
limited to the narrow hopes of a peasant proprietor. For indeed there is another side to
the picture. "Land," we are told, "is the best savings-bank for the working man."
Sometimes it is the second best. But the very best is the energy of himself and his
children; and the peasant proprietors are so intent on their land that they often care for
little else. Many even of the richest of them stint the food of themselves and their
families: they pride themselves on the respectability of their houses and furniture; but
they live in their kitchens for economy, and are practically worse housed and far
worse fed than the better class of English cottagers. And the poorest of them work
hard during very long hours; but they do not get through much work, because they
feed themselves worse than the poorest English labourers. They do not understand
that wealth is useful only as the means towards a real income of happiness; they
sacrifice the end to the means115 .

The English labourers represent the failure rather than the success of the English system. They are the descendants of those who for many
successive generations have not availed themselves of the opportunities by which
their abler and more adventurous neighbours were rising to leading posts at home,
and, what is far more important, were acquiring the fee simple of a great part of the
surface of the globe. Of the causes which have contributed to make the English race
the chief owners of the New World, the most important is that bold enterprise which
has made a man, who is rich enough to be a peasant proprietor, generally refuse to be
content with the humdrum life and the narrow income of a peasant. And among the
causes which have fostered this enterprise, none is more important than the absence of
the temptations to wait about for a petty inheritance, and to marry for the sake of
property rather than in the free exercise of individual choice—temptations which have
often dulled the energy of youth in places in which peasant properties have
predominated.

It is partly in consequence of the absence of these temptations that the "farmers" of
America, though they are men of the working class cultivating their own land with
their own hands, do not resemble "peasant proprietors." They invest their income
freely and wisely in developing the energies of themselves and their children; and
these energies constitute the chief part of their capital, for their land generally is as yet
of but little value. Their minds are always active, and though many of them have little
technical knowledge of agriculture, their acuteness and versatility enable them to find
out almost unerringly the best solution of the problem immediately before them.
That problem is generally to obtain a produce large in proportion to the labour spent
on it, though small in proportion to the abundant land at their disposal. In some parts
of America, however, in which land is beginning to get a scarcity value, and in which
the immediate neighbourhood of good markets is making an intensive cultivation
profitable, the methods of farming and of tenure are rearranging themselves on the
English model. And within the last few years there have been signs of a tendency on
the part of native Americans to hand over to persons of recent European origin the
farms of the West, as they have already done the farms of the East, and as they did
long ago the textile industries.
§ 6. Let us then turn to that English system of tenure. It is faulty and harsh in many
respects; but it stimulated and economized the enterprise and energy, which, aided by
England's geographical advantages and freedom from devastating wars, gave her the
leadership of the world in the arts of manufacture and colonization and, though in a
less marked degree, in agriculture. England has learnt lessons in agriculture from
many countries and especially the Netherlands; but on the whole she has taught far
more than she has learnt. And there is now no country except the Netherlands which
can compare with her in the amount of produce per acre of fertile land; and no country
in Europe which obtains nearly so high returns in proportion to the labour expended in
getting them116 .
The chief merit of the system is that it enables the landlord to keep in his own hands
the responsibility for that part and only that part of the property which he can look
after with but little trouble to himself, and little vexation to his tenant; and the

investment of which, though requiring both enterprise and judgment, does not demand
constant supervision of minor details. His part consists of land, buildings and
permanent improvements, and averages in England five times that which the farmer
has to supply himself; and he is willing to supply his part in the enterprise with this
great capital at a net rent which seldom gives interest at as much as three per cent. on
its cost. There is no other business in which a man can borrow what capital he wants
at so low a rate, or can often borrow so large a part of his capital at any rate at all. The
metayer indeed may be said to borrow an even larger share, but at a much higher
rate117 .
The second merit of the English system, which partly follows from the first, is that it
gives the landlord considerable freedom in the selection of an able and responsible
tenant. So far as the management of land, as opposed to its ownership, goes, the
accident of birth counts for less in England than in any other country of Europe. But
we have already seen that even in modern England the accident of birth counts for a
good deal in the access to posts of command in all kinds of business, to the learned
professions and even to skilled manual trades. And it counts for somewhat more in
English agriculture: for the good and bad qualities of landlords combine to prevent
their selecting tenants on strictly commercial principles, and they do not very often go
far afield for a new tenant118 .
§ 7. The number of people who have the opportunity of making a step forward in the
arts of agriculture is very great. And since the different branches of agriculture differ
from one another in general character less than do those of manufacture, it might have
been expected that new ideas in it would have followed one another quickly and have
been speedily diffused. But on the contrary progress has been slow. For the most
enterprising agriculturists drift towards the town; those who stay behind live more or
less isolated lives; and, as a result of natural selection and education, their minds have
always been more staid than those of townsmen, and less ready to suggest or even to
follow new paths. And further, though a manufacturer is nearly always safe in
copying a plan that has worked well with his neighbour in the same trade, a farmer is
not: for every farm has slight peculiarities of its own, so that the blind adoption of a
plan, that has worked well close by, is likely to fail; and its failure encourages others
in the belief that old and tried ways are the best.
Again, the variety in agricultural detail makes the proper keeping of farming accounts
very difficult. There are so many joint products and so many by-products, so many
complex and shifting relations of debtor and creditor between the several crops and
methods of feeding, that an ordinary farmer, even if he were as fond of accounts as he
is in fact averse to them, would have great difficulty in ascertaining, otherwise than by
a semi-instinctive guess, what is the price that will just pay him to raise a certain
amount of extra produce. He may know its prime cost with fair certainty, but he
seldom knows its true total cost; and this increases the difficulty of reading quickly
the teachings of experience and making progress by their aid119 .
And there is another difference between the mode of action of competition in
agriculture and in manufacture. If one manufacturer is unenterprising, others may be
able to step into the opening which he leaves vacant: but when one landowner does

not develop the resources of his land in the best way, others cannot make up for the
deficiency without calling into play the tendency to diminishing return; so that his
want of wisdom and enterprise makes the (marginal) supply price a little higher than it
otherwise would be120 . It is however true that the difference between the two cases
is only one of degree; since the growth of any branch of manufacture may be retarded
perceptibly by any falling-off in the ability and enterprise of the leading firms
engaged in it. The chief agricultural improvements have been made by landlords who
have themselves been townsmen or at least have associated a good deal with
townsmen, and by manufacturers in trades subsidiary to agriculture121 .
§ 8. Though nature yields generally a less than proportionate return to an increased
amount of labour of a given efficiency; man's part conforms generally to the law of
increasing return (i.e. it increases in aggregate efficiency more than in proportion to
the number of workers), in agriculture as well as in manufacture122 . But yet the
economies of production on a large scale are not quite similar in the two cases.
Firstly, agriculture must be spread over the broad land: raw material can be brought to
the manufacturer for him to work on; but the agriculturist must seek his work. Again,
the workers on the land must adapt their work to the seasons, and can seldom confine
themselves entirely to one class of work; and in consequence agriculture, even under
the English system, cannot move fast in the direction of the methods of manufacture.
But yet there are considerable forces tending to push it in that direction. The progress
of invention is constantly increasing the number of serviceable, but expensive
machines, for most of which a small farmer can find employment during only a very
short time. He may hire some of them; but there are many the use of which he can get
only by cooperation with his neighbours; and the uncertainties of the weather prevent
this plan from working very smoothly in practice123 .
Again, the farmer must go beyond the results of his own and his father's experience in
order to keep abreast of the changes of the day. He should be able to follow the
movements of agricultural science and practice closely enough to see their chief
practical applications to his own farm. To do all this properly requires a trained and
versatile mind; and a farmer who has these qualities could find time to direct the
general course of the management of several hundred, or even of several thousand
acres; and the mere superintendence of his men's work in matters of detail is not a
task fitting for him. The work which he ought to do is as difficult as that of a large
manufacturer, who would not spend his own strength on minute supervision which he
can easily hire subordinates to do. A farmer, who can do this higher work, must be
wasting his strength on work that is beneath him, unless he employs many gangs of
workmen each of them under a responsible foreman. But there are not many farms
which give scope for this, and there is therefore very little inducement for really able
men to enter the business of farming; the best enterprise and ability of the country
generally avoid agriculture and go to trades in which there is room for a man of first-
rate ability to do nothing but high class work, to do a great deal of it, and therefore to
get high earnings of management124 .

If it be assumed, as is the modern fashion, that the farmer is not to work habitually
with his men and to encourage them by his presence, it seems best for the economy of
production that farms should be as large as is practicable under the existing conditions
of land tenure; so as to give room for the use of highly specialized machines and for
the exercise of great ability on the part of the farmer. But if a farm is not very large,
and if, as is often the case, the farmer has no greater ability and activity of mind than
is commonly to be found among the better class of working foremen in manufactures;
then it would be best for others, and in the long run for himself, that he should return
to the old plan of working among his men. Perhaps also his wife might return to some
of those lighter tasks in and near the farmhouse which tradition ascribes to her. They
require discretion and judgment, they are not inconsistent with education and culture;
and combined with it they would raise and not lower the tone of her life, and her real
claims to a good social position. There is some reason for thinking that the stern
action of the principle of natural selection is now displacing those farmers, who have
not the faculty to do difficult head-work, and yet decline to do hand-work. Their
places are being taken by men of more than average natural ability who, with the help
of modern education, are rising from the ranks of labourers; who are quite able to
manage the ordinary routine work of a model farm; and who are giving to it a new life
and spirit by calling their men to come and work, instead of telling them to go and
work. Very large farms being left out of view, it is with rather small farms worked on
these principles that the immediate future of English agriculture seems to lie. Small
holdings have great advantages wherever so much care has to be given to individual
plants, that machinery is out of place. But modern applications of scientific methods
are giving an increasing importance to that economy of technical skill which can be
attained in a large nursery for choice flowers and fruits, with several highly paid
assistants.
§ 9. We may next consider how far landlords will in their own interest adjust the size
of holdings to the real needs of the people. Small holdings often require more
expensive buildings, roads and fences, and involve greater trouble and incidental
expenses of management to the landlord in proportion to their acreage than do large
holdings; and while a large farmer who has some rich land can turn poor soils to good
account, small holdings will not flourish generally except on good soil125 . Their
gross rental per acre must therefore always be at a higher rate than that of large farms.
But it is contended that, especially when land is heavily burdened by settlements,
landlords are unwilling to incur the expense of subdividing farms, unless they see
their way to rents for small holdings that will give them, in addition to high profits on
their outlay, a heavy insurance fund against the chance of having to throw the
holdings together again; and that the rental for small holdings, and especially for those
of only a few acres, is extravagantly high in many parts of the country. Sometimes the
prejudices of the landlord and his desire for undisputed authority make him positively
refuse to sell or let land to persons who are not in harmony with him on social,
political or religious questions. It seems certain that evils of this kind have always
been confined to a few districts, and that they are rapidly diminishing, but they rightly
attract much attention; for there is a public need in every district for small holdings, as
well as large; for allotments and large gardens; and generally for holdings so small
that they can be worked by people who have some other occupation126 .

Peasant proprietorship, as a system, is unsuited to the economic conditions of England, to her soil, her climate, and the temper of her people.

Yet there are a few peasant proprietors in England who:
- are happy in this condition.
- would buy small plots of land and would live happily on them, if they could get just what they wanted where they wanted it. 

They do not mind working hard and living sparely, provided they need call no one master; they love quiet and dislike excitement; and they have a great capacity
for growing fond of land. Reasonable opportunity should be given to such people to
invest their savings in small plots of land, on which they may raise suitable crops with
their own hands; and at the very least the present grievous legal charges on the
transfer of small plots should be diminished.

Co-operation might seem likely to flourish in agriculture and to combine the
economies of production on a large scale with many of the joys and the social gains of
small properties. It requires habits of mutual trust and confidence; and unfortunately
the bravest and the boldest, and therefore the most trustful, of the countrymen have
always moved to the towns, and agriculturists are a suspicious race. But Denmark,
Italy, Germany, and lastly Ireland have led the way in a movement which seems full
of promise for organized co-operation in the handling of dairy produce, in the making
of butter and cheese; in buying farmers' requisites and in selling farmers' produce: and
Britain is following in their wake. The movement is however of limited scope: it
scarcely touches work in the field itself.

As co-operation might combine more of the advantages of all systems of tenure, so
the cottier system of Ireland often combined the disadvantages of all; but its worst
evils and their causes have almost disappeared and the economic elements of the
problem are just now overshadowed by the political. We must therefore pass it by127
.
§ 10. The failures of the English system of land tenure in Ireland have brought into
clear relief difficulties which are inherent in it, but which have been kept in the
background in England by the conformity of the system to the business habits and the
character of the people. The chief of these difficulties arise from the fact that while
the system is competitive in its essence, the conditions of agriculture even in England
offer a strong resistance to the full action of free competition. To begin with, there are
special difficulties in ascertaining the facts on which that action must be based. We
have just noticed the difficulty of keeping exact farming accounts: to this must be
added that a farmer's calculations as to the rent which it is worth his while to
undertake to pay, are further hampered by the difficulty of deciding what is a normal
harvest and a normal level of prices. For good and bad seasons come so much in
cycles that many years are required to afford a trustworthy average of them128 : and
in those many years the industrial environment is likely to have changed much; the
local demand, the facilities for selling his own produce in distant markets and those
which assist competitors from a distance to sell their produce in his local markets may
all have changed.

The landlord in determining what rent to accept is met by this difficulty and also by
another, arising out of variations in the standards of ability among farmers in different parts of the country. The producer's surplus, or English rent, of a farm is that excess
which its produce yields over its expenses of cultivation, including normal profits to
the farmer: it being assumed that that farmer's ability and enterprise are such as are
normal for farms of that class in that place. The difficulty in view is to decide whether
these last words are to be interpreted broadly or narrowly.

It is clear that if a farmer falls below the standard of ability of his own district, if his
only forte is in driving hard bargains, if his gross produce is small and his net produce
even smaller in proportion; in such a case the landlord acts in the interest of all when
he hands over the farm to a more competent tenant, who will pay better wages, obtain
a much higher net produce and pay a somewhat higher rent. On the other hand, when
the local standard of normal ability and enterprise is low, it is not clearly right from an
ethical point of view, nor is it clearly in the business interests of the landlord in the
long run, that he should endeavour to take to himself a greater rent than can be paid
by a farmer who reaches that standard; even though it could be obtained by importing
a farmer from another district in which the standard is higher.

Closely related to this question is one as to the freedom the tenant should have to
develop the natural capabilities of his land at his own risk, with the understanding that
if he is successful he is to retain something more than mere normal profits on his
enterprise. So far as minor improvements go, this difficulty is in a great measure met
by long leases. These have done much for Scotland: but they have disadvantages of
their own. And as has been often observed, "the English tenant has always something
of a lease even when he has no lease": and again, "there are traces of métayage even
in tenures which are thoroughly English." When seasons and markets are favourable
to the farmer, he pays his full rent and avoids making demands on the landlord that
might set him thinking whether the rent ought not to be raised. When things go badly,
the landlord, partly from sympathy and partly as a matter of business, makes
temporary remissions of rent, and bears the expense of repairs, etc., which he would
otherwise have left for the farmer. There may thus be much give and take between
landlord and tenant without any change of nominal rent.

Custom has always given to the English tenant some partial security for compensation
for improvements made by him; and legislation has recently caught up custom, and
even passed it. The tenant is now practically secure against the raising of his rent on
account of increased yield of the soil due to improvements of a reasonable nature
made by himself: and on leaving he can claim compensation for the unexhausted
value of them, to be fixed by arbitration.

Finally a word may be said as to private and public interests with regard to open
spaces in towns. Wakefield and the American economists have taught us how a
sparsely inhabited new district is enriched by the advent of every new settler. The
converse truth is that a closely peopled district is impoverished by every one who
adds a new building or raises an old one higher. The want of air and light, of peaceful
repose out-of-doors for all ages and of healthy play for children, exhausts the energies
of the best blood of England which is constantly flowing towards our large towns. By
allowing vacant spaces to be built on recklessly we are committing a great blunder
from a business point of view. For the sake of a little material wealth we are wasting those energies which are the factors of production of all wealth: we are sacrificing
those ends towards which material wealth is only a means.
