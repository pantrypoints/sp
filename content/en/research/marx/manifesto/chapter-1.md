## Introduction 


The spectre of communism is haunting Europe. 

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre:
- Pope and Tsar
- Metternich and Guizot
- French Radicals and German police-spies.

The ruling parties have labeled all opposition parties as communistic. 

Opposition parties have hurled back the reproach of communism against:
- the more advanced opposition parties
- its own adversaries.

This led to 2 things:

1. All European powers have acknolwedged Communism to be a power.
2. Communists should openly publish their views, aims, tendencies, and meet this tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto

This is why we assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto. 


## Chapter 1

The history of existing societies is the history of class struggles between;
- freeman and slave
- patrician and plebeian
- lord and serf
- guild-master and journeyman
- oppressor and oppressed

These:
- were uninterrupted, hidden or open
- ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

<!-- In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of  -->

Society has always been organized into various orders with gradations of social rank. 
- Ancient Rome had patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves
- The Middle Ages had feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs

<!-- ; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. -->

The modern capitalist society sprouted from the ruins of feudal society. 
- It has not removed class antagonisms. 
- It instead established:
  - new classes
  - new conditions of oppression
  - new forms of struggle

Our epoch, the epoch of the capitalists, has a distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. 

Society as a whole is splitting up into 2 great hostile camps:
- Bourgeoisie
- Proletariat

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns.
- From these burgesses the first elements of the capitalists were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising capitalists. 

<!-- The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, 

and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development. -->

In the feudal system of industry, production was monopolised by closed guilds. 
- Such a system is no longer suitable for the growing wants of the new markets. 

It was replaced by the manufacturing system. 
- The guild-masters were pushed aside by the manufacturing middle class. 
- The division of labour between the different corporate guilds was replaced by the division of labour in each single workshop.

Even <!-- Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even --> manufacturing was not enough. Technology was needed, as steam and machinery revolutionizing industrial production. 

This led to the giant, Modern Industry.
- The manufacturing middle class was replaced by industrial millionaires, as the the modern capitalist.

<!--  the place of the industrial middle class by , the leaders of the whole industrial armies, . -->

<!-- Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the capitalists developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages. -->

The modern capitalists is therefore the product of a long series of revolutions in the modes of production and exchange.


## Politics from Economics

Each step in the development of the capitalists was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. 

The feudal nobility, feeding off of peasants, were replaced by monarchies, feeding off of the manufacturing middle class. 

<!-- An oppressed class under the sway of , an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune(4): here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); 

there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of  proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, -->

Thanks to the establishment of Modern Industry and the world market, the capitalists has finally become masters of the modern representative State. 
- The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole capitalists.

<!-- The capitalists, historically, has played a most revolutionary part. -->

The capitalists, wherever it has got the upper hand, has:
- put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. 
- torn the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”
- enshrined naked self-interest and callous “cash payment” as the bond between men. 
- replaced chivalry, sentimentalism, and religious fervour with the icy water of egotistical calculation. 
- resolved personal worth into exchange value
- replaced natural freedoms with that of Free Trade.
- replaced direct, brutal exploitation with exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions
- converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the scientist into its wage labourers.
- replaced the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages with slothful indolence 

<!-- The capitalists has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation. -->


<!-- It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.

The capitalists cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. 

Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. 

Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the capitalist epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind. -->

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the capitalists around the world.
- It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.
- They have destroyed long-established national industries with new ones that use raw material from the remotest zones, producing goods consumed for the whole world. 
- They replace national self-sufficiency with the universal interdependence of nations.
- They draw even the most barbarous nations into civilisation.
- They use the cheap prices of commodities to down all protectionist walls. 
- They compel all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the capitalist mode of production and become capitalist themselves.

<!-- The capitalists has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. 

To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood.  -->

<!-- They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but  -->


<!--  every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and
 -->

<!--   And as in material, so also in intellectual production. 

The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature. -->

<!-- The capitalists, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all,  -->


<!-- ; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to . In one word, it creates a world after its own image. -->

The capitalists has subjected the countryside to the urban domination. 
- It has created enormous cities with a huge urban population compared with the rural
- It has made the rural dependent on the urban and the poor countries dependent on the rich countries

<!-- , and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of capitalist, the East on the West. -->
