## Communist Party Versus Labor Parties

What is the relationship between Communists and the proletarians?

The Communist Party is not opposed to the other working-class parties.
- Its interest is that of the proletariat as a whole.
- It has no sectarian principles of its own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties only in: 

1. The national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries

They point out the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of nationality. 

2. The various stages of development of the working class struggle against the capitalists

They always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communist Party:
- is the most advanced and resolute of the working-class parties of every country
  - It pushes forward all other working-class parties 
- clearly understands the strategy, conditions, and ultimate general results of the proletarian movement


The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties:
- formation of the proletariat into a class
- overthrow of the capitalist supremacy
- conquest of political power by the proletariat.

The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in not based on ideas or principles that have been invented or discovered by any would-be universal reformer.
- They merely express, generally, the actual relations arising from the current class struggle as part of historical class struggles. 


## Property

The abolition of existing property relations is not 

The distinctive feature of communism is the abolition of capitalist property, and not of general property.

<!-- as private property, -->

All property relations have continually changed throughout history. 
- The French Revolution abolished feudal property in favour of capitalist property.

<!-- The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the . But modern capitalist private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few. -->

<!-- In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of . -->

We Communists have been reproached for this, since capitalist property is:
- the fruit of a rich man’s own labour <!-- with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as --> 
- the basis of all personal freedom, activity and independence of a rich man.

We do not aim to abolish the small property of the proletariat, but the private property of the modern capitalists. 

<!-- Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the capitalist form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily. -->

<!-- But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the . Let us examine both sides of this antagonism. -->

Modern capitalist property is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour.

<!-- To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion. -->

Capital is both a personal and a social power.
- When it is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.


The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage. 
- It is that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer in bare existence as a labourer. 
- Therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong a bare existence. 

We do not intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labour. 
<!-- , an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others.  -->

All that we want is to do away with the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the labourer:
- lives merely to increase capital, and
- is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.

In capitalist society, labour is just a means to increase private profits. <!--  accumulated labour. --> 

In Communist society, <!-- accumulated --> labour is just a means to <!-- widen, to --> enrich and promote the labourer's existence.

<!-- In capitalist society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past.  -->

<!-- In capitalist society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality. -->

The capitalist say that the abolition of private profits is the abolition of individuality and freedom!
- Yes, we aim to abolish capitalist individuality, capitalist independence, and capitalist freedom.
  - The capitalist should work like all other classes, and not be free from having to work
<!-- By freedom is meant, under the present capitalist conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying. -->

But if selling and buying disappears, then free selling and buying disappears also. 

The real difference between the free selling and buying of the capitalist and the selling and buying of Communism is that the latter is regulated by Comunists.  

<!-- This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other “brave words” of our capitalist about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the capitalist conditions of production, and of the capitalists itself. -->

You are horrified at our plan to do away with capitalist property. 
- You fail to see that in your society, the capitalist already own 90% of property, depriving the rest. 
- Therefore you reproach us from giving property back to the majority of society. 

<!-- , therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society. -->

<!-- In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend. -->

From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, , i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into capitalist property, into capital, from that moment, 

You say that individuality vanishes when money, or rent, can no longer be monopolised
- It follows that you define “individual” to be the capitalist, and not the middle-class owner of property. 
- The invidiual capitalist must be swept out of the way, and made impossible.

Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society.
- All it does is to deprive man of the power to subjugate the labour of others. 

People have objected that when capitalist property is abolished, then:
- all work will cease, and
- universal laziness will overtake us.

We answer that if this were true, then capitalist society should have stopped long ago due to the sheer idleness or the rich because:
- those who do productive work get nothing
- those who do nothing productive get everything

Their objection is based on the wrong beilef that wage-labour depends on capital.

This is wrong. It is like saying that the disappearance of a single culture will lead to the disappearance of all cultures. In reality, that loss is not a loss to society. 

<!-- All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the capitalist, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture. -->

<!-- That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine. -->

<!-- But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of capitalist property, the standard of your capitalist notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your capitalist production and capitalist property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class. -->

You have such wrong ideas because you yourself use the current mode of production and form of property. This is the same misconception that the ruling class has. 

<!-- The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property – historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own capitalist form of property. -->
