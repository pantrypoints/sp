## History of the Manifesto 

The Communist League is an international association of workers. It could only be secret one, under conditions at the time. 

It has commissioned us, at the Congress held in London in November 1847, to publish a detailed theoretical and practical programme for the Party. 

This led to the following Manifesto. 

It was printed in London in German a few weeks before the February [French] Revolution [in 1848]. First published ,

It was published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red Republican, London, and in 1871 in at least 3 different translations in America. 

The french version first appeared in Paris shortly before the June insurrection of 1848, and recently in Le Socialiste of New York. 

<!-- A new translation is in the course of preparation. A Polish version appeared in London shortly after it was first published in Germany. A Russian translation was published in Geneva in the sixties [A]. Into Danish, too, it was translated shortly after its appearance. -->

<!-- However much that state of things may have altered during the last twenty-five years, the general principles laid down in the Manifesto are, on the whole, as correct today as ever. Here and there, some detail might be improved. The practical application of the principles will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II. That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. In view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class, in view of the practical experience gained, first in the February Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months, this programme has in some details been antiquated. One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.” (See The Civil War in France: Address of the General Council of the International Working Men’ s Association, 1871, where this point is further developed.) Further, it is self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time, because it comes down only to 1847; also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition parties (Section IV), although, in principle still correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the political situation has been entirely changed, and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated.

But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter. A subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the present day; but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that. -->

## The 1882 Russian Edition

### History of the Russian Manifesto 

The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, translated by Bakunin [A], was published early in the ’sixties by the printing office of the Kolokol [reference to the Free Russian Printing House]. 

Back then (December 1847):
- the West saw it only as a literary curiosity. Such a view would be impossible today
- the proletarian movement occupied a little field relative to the other opposition parties in various countries
- Russia was the last great reserve of all European reaction
- the United States absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of Europe through immigration

<!-- Precisely Russia and the United States are missing here.  -->

Both countries provided Europe with raw materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial products. 

Both were, therefore, in one way of another, pillars of the existing European system.

How very different today. 

European immigration fitted North American for a gigantic agricultural production, whose competition is shaking the very foundations of European landed property — large and small. 

At the same time, it enabled the US to exploit its tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break the industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and especially of England, existing up to now. 

Both circumstances react in a revolutionary manner upon America itself. 

The whole political constitution is based on the small and middle land ownership of the farmers.

Step by step, this ownership is succumbing to the competition of giant farms.

At the same time, a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capital funds are developing for the first time in the industrial regions.

And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9, the European princes and the European capitalist, found their only salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian intervention.

The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction. 

Today, he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina [B], and Russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe.

The Communist Manifesto had aimed to dissolve modern capitalist property.

But in Russia we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle and capitalist property, just beginning to develop, more than half the land owned in common by the peasants. 

Can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? 

Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West?

If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development.
