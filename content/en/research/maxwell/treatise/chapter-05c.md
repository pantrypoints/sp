68.] It appears, therefore, that the analogy between the conduction of heat
and electrostatic phenomena has its limits, beyond which we must not attempt
to push it. At the time when it was pointed out by Thomson, men of science

were already acquainted with the great work of Fourier on the conduction of
heat in solid bodies, and their minds were more familiar with the ideas there
developed than with those belonging to current electricity, or to the theory of
the displacements of a medium.

It is true that Ohm had, in 1827, applied the results obtained by Fourier for
heat to the theory of the distribution of electric currents in conductors, but it
was long before the practical value of Ohm’s work was understood, and till
men became familiar with the idea of electric currents in solid conductors,
any illustration of electrostatic phenomena drawn from such currents would
have served rather to obscure than to enlighten their minds.

69.] When an electric current flows through a solid conductor, the direc-
tion of the current at any point is from places of higher to places of lower
potential, and its intensity is proportional to the rate at which the potential
decreases from point to point of a line drawn in the direction of the current.
We may suppose equipotential surfaces drawn in the conducting medium.
The lines of flow of the current are everywhere at right angles to the equipo-
tential surfaces, and the rate of flow is proportional to the number of equipo-
tential surfaces which would be cut by a line of unit length drawn in the
direction of the current.

It appears, therefore, that this case of a conducting medium through which
an electric current is passing has certain points of analogy with that of a
dielectric medium bounded by electrified bodies.
In both the medium is divided into layers by a series of equipotential sur-
faces. In both there is a system of lines which are everywhere perpendicular
to these surfaces. In the one case these lines are called current lines or lines
of flow; in the other they are called lines of electric force or electric induction.

An assemblage of such lines drawn from every point of a given line is
called a surface of flow. Since the lines of which this surface is formed are ev-
erywhere in the direction of the electric current, no part of the current passes
through the surface of flow. Such a surface therefore may be regarded as
impervious to the current without in any way altering the state of things.
If the line from which the assemblage of lines of flow is drawn is one
which returns into itself, which we shall call a closed curve, or, more briefly,CURRENT.

a ring, the surface of flow will have the form of a tube and is called a tube
of flow. Any two sections of the same tube of flow correspond to each other
in the sense defined in Art. 54, and the quantities of electricity which in the
same time flow across these two sections are equal.
Here then we have the analogue of Faraday’s law, that the quantities of
electricity upon corresponding areas of opposed conducting surfaces are equal
and opposite.

Faraday made great use of this analogy between electrostatic phenomena
and those of the electric current, or, as he expressed it, between induction in
dielectrics and conduction in conductors, and he proved that, in many cases,
induction and conduction are associated phenomena. Exp. Res. 1320, 1326.
We must remember, however, that the electric current cannot be maintained
constant through a conductor which resists its passage except by a continual
expenditure of energy, whereas induction in a perfectly insulating dielectric
between oppositely electrified conductors may be maintained in it for an in-
definitely long time without any expenditure of energy, except that which is
required to produce the original electrification. The element of time enters
into the question of conduction in a way in which it does not appear in that
of induction.

70.] But we may arrive at a more perfect mental representation of induction
by comparing it, not with the instantaneous state of a current, but with the
small displacements of a medium of invariable density.
Returning to the case of an electric current through a solid conductor, let
us suppose that the current, after flowing for a very short time, ceases. If
we consider a surface drawn within the solid, then if this surface intersects
the tubes of flow, a certain quantity of electricity will have passed from one
side of the surface to the other during the time when the current was flowing.
This passage of electricity through the surface is called electric displacement,
and the displacement through a given surface is the quantity of electricity
which passes through it. In the case of a continuous current the displacement
increases continuously as long as the current is kept up, but if the current lasts
for a finite time, the displacement reaches its final value and then remains
constant. The lines, surfaces, and tubes of flow of the transient current are
also lines, surfaces, and tubes of displacement. The displacements across any 2 sections of the same tube of displacement are equal. At the beginning of each unit tube of displacement there is a unit of positive electricity, and at
the end of the tube there is a unit of negative electricity.
At every point of the medium there is a state of stress consisting of a ten-
sion in the direction of the line of displacement through the point and a pres-
sure in all directions at right angles to this line. The numerical value of the
tension is equal to that of the pressure, namely, the square of the intensity of
the electric force divided by 4π.

71.] By the consideration of the properties of the tubes of induction and
the equipotential surfaces we may easily prove several important general the-
orems in the theory of electricity, the demonstration of which by the older
methods is long and difficult. The properties of a tube of induction have
already been stated, but for the sake of what follows we may state them
again:—
(1) If a tube of induction is cut by an imaginary surface, the quantity of
electricity displaced across a section of the tube is the same at whatever part
of the tube the section be made.
(2) In every part of the course of a line of electrostatic force it cuts the
equipotential surfaces at right angles, and is proceeding from a place of higher
to a place of lower potential.
Note. This statement is true only when the distribution of electric force
can be completely represented by means of a set of equipotential surfaces.
This is always the case when the electricity is in equilibrium, but when there
are electric currents, though in some parts of the field it may be possible to
draw a set of equipotential surfaces, there are other parts of the field where the
distribution of electric force cannot be represented by means of such surfaces.
For an electric current is always of the nature of a circuit which returns into
itself, and such a circuit cannot in every part of its course be proceeding from
places of higher to places of lower potential.
72.] It may be observed that in (1) we have used the words ‘tube of induc-
tion,’ and in (2) the words ‘line of electrostatic force.’ In a fluid dielectric,
such as air, the line of electrostatic force is always in the same direction as
the tube of induction, and it may seem pedantic to maintain a distinction be-
tween them. There are other cases, however, in which it is very important toELECTRIFICATION AT ENDS OF INDUCTION TUBE.
63
remember that a tube of induction is defined with respect to the phenomenon
which we have called electric displacement, while a line of force is defined
with respect to the electric force. In fluids the electric displacement is always
in the direction of the electric force, but there are solid bodies in which this is
not the case∗ , and in which, therefore, the tubes of induction do not coincide
in direction with the lines of force.
73.] It follows from (1) that every tube of induction begins at a place
where there is a certain quantity of positive electricity and ends at a place
where there is an equal quantity of negative electricity, and that, conversely,
from any place where there is positive electricity a tube may be drawn, and
that wherever there is negative electricity a tube must terminate.
74.] It follows from (2) that the potential at the beginning of a tube is
higher than at the end of it. Hence, no tube can return into itself, for in that
case the same point would have two different potentials, which is impossible.
75.] From this we may prove that if the potential at every point of a closed
surface is the same, and if there is no electrified body within that surface, the
potential at any point within the region enclosed within the closed surface is
the same as that at the surface.
For if there were any difference of potential between one point and another
within this region, there would be lines of force from the places of higher
towards the places of lower potential. These lines, as we have seen, cannot
return into themselves. Hence they must have their extremities either within
the region or without it. Neither extremity of a line of force can be within the
region, for there must be positive electrification at the beginning and negative
electrification at the end of a line of force, but by our hypothesis there is no
electrification within the region. On the other hand, a line of force within
the region cannot have its extremities without the region, for in that case it
must enter the region at one point of the surface and leave it at another, and
therefore by (2) the potential must be higher at the point of entry than at the
point of issue, which is contrary to our hypothesis that the potential is the
same at every point of the surface.
Hence no line of force can exist within the region, and therefore the po-

tential at any point within the region is the same as that at the surface itself.
76.] It follows from this theorem, that if the closed surface is the internal
surface of a hollow conducting vessel, and if no electrified body is within the
surface, there is no electrification on the internal surface. For if there were,
lines of force would proceed from the electrified parts of the surface into the
region within, and we have already proved that there are no lines of force in
that region.

We have already proved this by experiment (Art. 20), but we now see that
it is a necessary consequence of the properties of lines of force.
