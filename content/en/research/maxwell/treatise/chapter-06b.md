84.] Definition.—The electric or electromotive force at a point is the force which would be experienced by a small body charged with the unit of positive electricity and placed at that point, the electrification of the system being supposed to remain undisturbed by the presence of this unit of electricity. 

We shall use the German letter E as the symbol of electric force. 85.] Let us now return to the case of a sphere whose radius is r, the exter- nal surface of which is uniformly electrified, the surface-density of the electri- fication being σ. As we have already proved, the whole charge of the sphere is e = 4πr2 σ.

At any point outside the sphere such that the distance from the centre of the
sphere is r′ the electromotive force, E, is directed from the centre, and its
value is
e
E = ′2 .
rVALUE OF THE POTENTIAL.
72
If the point is close to the surface of the sphere, r′ = r, and
e
E = 2 = 4πσ,
r
or the electric force close to the surface of an electrified sphere is at right
angles to the surface and is equal to the surface-density multiplied by 4π.

We have already seen that in all cases the electric force close to the surface of a conductor is at right angles to that surface, and is proportional to the surface-density. We now, by means of this particular case, find that the
constant ratio of the electric force to the surface-density is 4π for a uniformly
electrified sphere, and therefore this is the ratio for a conductor of any form.

The equation
E = 4πσ
is the complete expression of the law discovered by Coulomb and referred to
in Arts. 47 and 81.
Value of the Potential.
86.] We must next consider the values of the potential at different distances
from a small electrified body.
Definition. The electric potential at any point is the work which must be
expended in order to bring a body charged with unit of electricity from an
infinite distance to that point.

If ψ is the potential at A and ψ ′ that at B, then the work which must be
spent by the external agency in overcoming electrical force while carrying a
unit of electricity from A to B is ψ ′ − ψ.
The quantity ψ ′ − ψ would also represent the work which would be done
by the electrical forces in assisting the transfer of the unit of electricity from
B to A if the motion were reversed.
If the force from B to A were constant and equal to E, then
ψ ′ − ψ = BA . E.

In general, the electric force varies as the body moves from B to A, so that
we cannot at once apply this method of finding the difference of potentials.POTENTIAL AT A POINT.
73
But, by breaking up the path BA into a sufficient number of parts, we may
make these parts so small that the electric force may be regarded as uniform
during the passage of the body along any one of these parts. We may then
ascertain the parts of the work done in each part of the path, and by adding
them together, obtain the whole work done during the passage from B to A.

Let us suppose a unit of electricity placed at O, and let the distances of the

points A, B, C, ... Z from O be a, b, c, ... z. The electric force at A is 2 ,

at B 2 , and so on, all in the direction from O to A.
b
To find the work which must be done in order to bring a unit of electricity
from A to B we must multiply the distance AB by the average of the electro-
motive force at the various points between A and B. The least value of the

force is 2 and the greatest value is 2 · Hence the work required is greater

than 2 and less than 2 . Now AB is a − b, and the true value of the work

b
is the excess of the potential at B over that at A. Hence if we now write A,
B, C, ... Z for the potentials at the corresponding points, we may express
the work required to bring the unit of electricity from A to B by B − A. This
quantity therefore is greater than

By increasing the number of points between A and Z and making the inter-
vals between them smaller we may make the greatest ratio, p, as near to unity
as we please, and we may therefore assert that, as the line AZ is more and

more minutely divided, the quantity p and its reciprocal approach unity as

We have thus found the difference between the potentials at A and Z. To
determine the actual value of the potential, say at Z, we must refer to the
definition of the potential, that it is the work expended in bringing unit ofPOTENTIAL AT A POINT.

the above expression to suppose the point A removed to an infinite distance
from O, in which case the potential A is zero, and the reciprocal of the dis-

or in words, the numerical value of the potential at a given point due to unit
of electricity at a given distance is the reciprocal of the number expressing
that distance.

If the charge is e, then the potential at a distance z is .
z
The potential due to a number of charges placed at different distances from
the given point is found by adding the potentials due to each separate charge,
regard being had to the sign of each potential.
