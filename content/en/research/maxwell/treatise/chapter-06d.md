89.] Another simple case of electrification is that in which the electrodes
are two parallel plane surfaces at a distance c. We shall suppose the dimen-
sions of these surfaces to be very great compared with the distance betweenFORCE BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL PLANES.

them, and we shall consider the electrical action only in that part of the space
between the planes whose distance from the edges of the plates is many times
greater than c.

Let A be the potential of the upper plane in the figure, and
B that of the lower plane. Then the electric force at any point

P between the planes, and not

near the edge of either plane, is

sity on the upper plane is found by Coulomb’s Law by dividing this quantity
by 4π . If σ be the surface density

4πc
The surface density on the plane B is equal to this in magnitude but opposite
in sign.

Let us now consider the quantity of electricity on an area S, which we
may suppose cut out from the upper plane by an imaginary closed curve.
Multiplying S into σ, we find
σ=
A−B
S.

4πc
The quantity of electricity on an equal area of the plane B taken exactly op-
posite to S will be −e. The energy of the electrification of these two portions
of electricity is, by Art. 31,
e=
Q = 12 {Ae + B(−e)} = 12 (A − B)e.

Expressing this in terms of e it becomes

If c, the distance between the surfaces, be made to increase to c ′ the
charges of the surfaces remaining the same, the energy will become

and this is the work done by external agency in pulling the planes asunder
against the electric attraction.
If F is the electric attraction between the two areas S,

In this expression F is the force of attraction on the area S determined
in dynamical measure from observation of its effects. S is the area of the
surface and π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
The difference between the potentials, A and B, of the two planes is easily
found in terms of e by means of equation (2), thus,

91.] In Sir William Thomson’s attracted disk electrometers a disk is so
arranged that when in its proper position the surface of the disk forms part
of a much larger plane surface extending for a considerable distance on all
sides of the disk. The part of the surface outside the moveable disk is called
the Guard Ring and the surface of the disk and guard ring together may be
considered as the surface of a large disk, part of which, near its centre, is
moveable. Opposite this disk is placed another disk having its surface parallel

to the first disk and much larger than the moveable disk. The electrification
of the moveable disk is then the same as that of a small portion of one of
the large opposed planes taken at a considerable distance from the edge of
the plane, and only very small corrections are needed to make the formulæ
already given apply to the case of the moveable disk.
The distribution of electrification and of electric force near the edges of
the large disks is by no means so simple. It is calculated in Art. 202 of my
larger Treatise, and the lines of force and equipotential surfaces are shown in
Plate V at the end of this book.

92.] The direct problem of electrostatics—the problem which the circum-
stances of every electrostatic experiment present to us—may be stated as fol-
lows.
A system of insulated conductors is given in form and position, and the
electric charge of each conductor is given, required the distribution of elec-
tricity on each conductor and the electric potential at any point of the field.
The mathematical difficulties of the solution of this problem have been
overcome hitherto only in a small number of cases, and it is only by a study
of what we may call the inverse problem that the results we possess have
been obtained.

In the inverse problem, a possible distribution of potential being given, it
is required to find the forms, positions, and charges of a system of conductors
which shall be consistent with this distribution of potential.
Any number of solutions of this latter problem may be obtained by tak-
ing, instead of the electrified bodies of the original distribution, any set of
equipotential surfaces surrounding them, and supposing these surfaces to be
the surfaces of conductors, the charge of each conductor being equal to the
sum of the charges of all the bodies of the original distribution which it en-
closes.

Every electrical problem of which we know the solution has been con-
structed by an inverse process of this kind. It is therefore of great importance
to the electrician that he should know what results have been obtained in this
way, since the only method by which he can expect to solve a new problem
is by reducing it to one of the cases in which a similar problem has been
constructed by the inverse process.
