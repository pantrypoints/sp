130.] The third class of bodies has an electric resistance so much greater
than that of metals, or even of electrolytes, that they are often called insu-
lators of electricity. All the gases, many liquids which are not electrolytes,
such as spirit of turpentine, naphtha, &c., and many solid bodies, such as
gutta-percha, caoutchouc in its various forms, amber and resins, crystallized electrolytes, glass when cold, &c., are insulators.

SPECIFIC INDUCTIVE CAPACITY


They are called insulators because they do not allow a current of electricity
to pass through them. They are called dielectrics because certain electrical
actions can be transmitted through them. According to the theory adopted
in this book, when an electromotive force acts on a dielectric it causes the
electricity to be displaced within it in the direction of the electromotive force,
the amount of the displacement being proportional to the electromotive force,
but depending also on the nature of the dielectric, the displacement due to
equal electromotive forces being greater in solid and liquid dielectrics than in
air or other gases.

When the electromotive force is increasing, the increase of electric dis-
placement is equivalent to an electric current in the same direction as the
electromotive force. When the electromotive force is constant there is still
displacement, but no current. When the electromotive force is diminishing,
the diminution of the electric displacement is equivalent to a current in the
opposite direction.

131.] In a dielectric, electric displacement calls into action an internal
electromotive force in a direction opposite to that of the displacement, and
tending to reduce the displacement to zero. The seat of this internal force is
in every part of the dielectric where displacement exists.
To produce electric displacement in a dielectric requires an expenditure of
work measured by half the product of the electromotive force into the electric
displacement. This work is stored up as energy within the dielectric, and is
the source of the energy of an electrified system which renders it capable of
doing mechanical work.

The amount of displacement produced by a given electromotive force is
different in different dielectrics. The ratio of the displacement in any dielec-
tric to the displacement in a vacuum due to the same electromotive force
is called the Specific Inductive Capacity of the dielectric, or more briefly,
the Dielectric Constant. This quantity is greater in dense bodies than in a
so-called vacuum, and is approximately equal to the square of the index of
refraction. Thus Dr. L. Boltzmann∗ finds for various substances,

132.] Schiller (Pogg. Ann. CLII. 535) ascertained the time of the electri-
cal vibrations when a condenser is discharged through an electromagnet. He
finds in this way the following values of the dielectric coefficients of various
substances, and compares them with those found by Siemens by the method
of a rapid commutator.
