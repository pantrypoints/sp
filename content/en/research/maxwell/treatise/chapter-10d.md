178.] The most convenient method of studying the theory of thermo-
electric phenomena is by means of a diagram in which the temperature and
electric entropy of a metal at any instant are represented by the horizontal
and vertical coordinates of a point on the diagram. Thus, if OC represents
the temperature, reckoned from absolute zero on the thermodynamic scale,
of a piece of a certain metal, and if CA represents the electric entropy
corresponding to the same piece of metal, then the point A will indicate by
its position in the diagram the thermo-electric state of the piece of metal. In
the same way we may find other points in the diagram corresponding to the
same metal under other conditions or to other metals.
Fig. 40.

If in the path of an electric current electricity passes from one metal to
another or from one portion of a metal to another at a different temperature,
the different points of the electric circuit will be represented by correspond-
ing points on the thermo-electric diagram. The path of the current will thus
be represented by a line or path on the thermo-electric diagram. When the
current flows in a single metal, A, from a point at a temperature OC to another at a temperature Oc, the path is represented by the line Aa, the points of which represent the state of the metal at intermediate temperatures. The form
of the path depends on the nature of the metal and on the other influences
which act on it besides temperature, such as stress and strain. Professor Tait,
however, finds that for most of the metals except iron and nickel, the path on
the thermo-electric diagram is a straight line.

SPECIFIC HEAT OF ELECTRICITY


When the current flows from the metal A to another metal B at the same
temperature, the path is represented by AB, a vertical straight line. The circuit
traversed by the electric current will thus be represented by a circuit on the
thermo-electric diagram.

The heat generated while a unit of electricity moves along the path Aa
is represented by the area of the figure AaQP A, bounded by the path Aa,
the horizontal ordinate at a, the line of zero temperature and the horizontal
ordinate at A. If this area lies on the right of the path, it represents heat
generated; if it lies to the left of the path it represents heat absorbed.
179.] If electricity were a fluid, running through the conductor as water
does through a tube, and always giving out or absorbing heat till its temper-
ature is that of the conductor, then in passing from hot to cold it would give
out heat and in passing from cold to hot it would absorb heat, and the amount
of this heat would depend on the specific heat of the fluid.
In the diagram the specific heat of the fluid at A would be represented by
the line αP, where α is the point where the tangent to the path at A cuts the
line of zero temperature, and P is the intersection with the same line of the
horizontal ordinate through A.

The line Aaα in the diagram is such that the electric entropy increases as
the temperature rises. This is the case with copper, and therefore we may
assert that the specific heat of electricity in copper is positive.
In other metals, as for instance iron, the electric entropy diminishes as the
temperature rises, as is represented by the line βbB. The specific heat of
electricity in such metals is negative, and at B is represented by the line βT.
180.] Thomson, who discovered first from theory and then by experimental
verification the thermal effect of an electric current in an unequally heated
metal, expresses the fact by saying that vitreous electricity carries heat with
it in copper, while resinous electricity carries heat with it in iron.

ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE.

We must remember, however, that these phrases are not intended by Thom-
son, and must not be understood by us, to imply that electricity either positive
or negative is a fluid which can be heated or cooled and which has a definite
specific heat. Since, therefore, the whole set of phrases are merely analog-
ical we shall adhere to the ordinary convention according to which vitreous
electricity is reckoned positive, and we shall say that the specific heat of elec-
tricity is positive in copper but negative in iron.

The obvious fact that no real fluid can have a negative specific heat need
not disturb us, for we do not assert that electricity is a real fluid.
181.] Let us next consider a circuit consisting of two linear conductors
of the metals A and B respectively, the two junctions being kept at different
temperatures, represented in the diagram by OC and Oc. This electric circuit
will be represented in the diagram by the circuit AabBA. If the current flows
in the direction AabB till one unit of electricity has been transmitted, the
following thermal effects will take place.

(1) In the metal A heat will be generated as the electricity flows from the
hot junction to the cold junction. The amount of this heat is represented by
the area AaQP A.
(2) At the cold junction, where the electricity passes from the metal A to
the metal B, heat will be generated. The amount of this heat is represented
by the area abSQa.
(3) In the metal B heat will be generated as the electricity flows from the
cold junction to the hot junction. The amount of this heat is represented by
the area bBT Sb.
(4) At the hot junction, where the electricity passes from the metal B to
the metal A, heat will be absorbed. The amount of this heat is represented
by the area BAP T B. The reverse order of the letters shews that this area is
to be taken negatively.


MEASUREMENT OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE

The whole heat generated is therefore represented by the area AabBT P A,
and the whole heat absorbed by BAP T B. The total effect is therefore an
absorption of heat represented by the area AabBA.
The energy corresponding to this heat cannot be lost. It is transformed
into electrical work spent upon the current by an electromotive force acting
in the direction of the current. Since the quantity of electricity transmitted by the current is supposed to be unity, the energy, which is the product of the electromotive force into the quantity of electricity transmitted, must be equal
to the electromotive force itself.

Hence the electromotive force is represented by the area AabBA, and it
acts in the direction represented by the order of the letters—that is,
Hot, metal A, cold, metal B, hot.
This electromotive force will, if the resistance of the circuit is finite, pro-
duce an actual current∗ . It was by means of such currents that the thermo-
electric properties of metallic circuits were first discovered by Seebeck in
1822.
