193*.] When a series of experiments is made with a voltaic battery in which polarization occurs, the polarization diminishes during the time that the current is not flowing, so that when it begins to flow again the current is stronger than after it has flowed for some time. If, on the other hand, the resistance of the circuit is diminished by allowing the current to flow through a short shunt, then, when the current is again made to flow through the ordinary circuit, it is at first weaker than its normal strength on account of the great polarization produced by the use of the short circuit.

To get rid of these irregularities in the current, which are exceedingly trou- blesome in experiments involving exact measurements, it is necessary to get rid of the polarization, or at least to reduce it as much as possible. It does not appear that there is much polarization at the surface of the zinc plate when immersed in a solution of sulphate of zinc or in dilute sulphuric acid. The principal seat of polarization is at the surface of the negative metal. When the fluid in which the negative metal is immersed is dilute sulphuric acid, it is seen to become covered with bubbles of hydrogen gas, arising from the electrolytic decomposition of the fluid. Of course these bubbles, by pre- venting the fluid from touching the metal, diminish the surface of contact and increase the resistance of the circuit. But besides the visible bubbles it is certain that there is a thin coating of hydrogen, probably not in a free state, adhering to the metal, and as we have seen that this coating is able to produce an electromotive force in the reverse direction, it must necessarily diminish the electromotive force of the battery.

Various plans have been adopted to get rid of this coating of hydrogen. It
may be diminished to some extent by mechanical means, such as stirring the
liquid, or rubbing the surface of the negative plate. In Smee’s battery the
could measure the quantity of heat generated or absorbed when unit of electricity passes from a
metal to an electrolyte, or from an electrolyte to a metal, we could not determine from this the
value of the electromotive force from the metal to the electrolyte.

If this is the case with liquid electrolytes, we have still less hope of determining the electro-
motive force from a metal to a gas, for we cannot produce a current from the one to the other
without tumultuary and non-reversible effects, such as disintegration of the metal and violent
disturbance of the gas by the discontinuous discharge.CONSTANT BATTERIES.

negative plates are vertical, and covered with finely divided platinum from
which the bubbles of hydrogen easily escape, and in their ascent produce a
current of liquid which helps to brush off other bubbles as they are formed.
A far more efficacious method, however, is to employ chemical means.

These are of two kinds. In the batteries of Grove and Bunsen the negative
plate is immersed in a fluid rich in oxygen, and the hydrogen, instead of
forming a coating on the plate, combines with this substance. In Grove’s
battery the plate is of platinum immersed in strong nitric acid. In Bunsen’s
first battery it is of carbon in the same acid. Chromic acid is also used for
the same purpose, and has the advantage of being free from the acid fumes
produced by the reduction of nitric acid.

A different mode of getting rid of the hydrogen is by using copper as the
negative metal, and covering the surface with a coat of oxide. This, however,
rapidly disappears when it is used as the negative electrode. To renew it Joule
has proposed to make the copper plates in the form of disks, half immersed
in the liquid, and to rotate them slowly, so that the air may act on the parts
exposed to it in turn.

The other method is by using as the liquid an electrolyte, the cation of
which is a metal highly negative to zinc.

In Daniell’s battery a copper plate is immersed in a saturated solution of
sulphate of copper. When the current flows through the solution from the
zinc to the copper no hydrogen appears on the copper plate, but copper is
deposited on it. When the solution is saturated, and the current is not too
strong, the copper appears to act as a true cation, the anion SO4 travelling
towards the zinc.

When these conditions are not fulfilled hydrogen is evolved at the cathode,
but immediately acts on the solution, throwing down copper, and uniting with
SO4 to form oil of vitriol. When this is the case, the sulphate of copper next
the copper plate is replaced by oil of vitriol, the liquid becomes colourless,
and polarization by hydrogen gas again takes place. The copper deposited in
this way is of a looser and more friable structure than that deposited by true
electrolysis.

To ensure that the liquid in contact with the copper shall be saturated with
sulphate of copper, crystals of this substance must be placed in the liquidDANIELL’S BATTERY.

close to the copper, so that when the solution is made weak by the deposition
of the copper, more of the crystals may be dissolved.

We have seen that it is necessary that the liquid next the copper should be
saturated with sulphate of copper. It is still more necessary that the liquid in
which the zinc is immersed should be free from sulphate of copper. If any
of this salt makes its way to the surface of the zinc it is reduced, and copper
is deposited on the zinc. The zinc, copper, and fluid then form a little circuit
in which rapid electrolytic action goes on, and the zinc is eaten away by an
action which contributes nothing to the useful effect of the battery.
To prevent this, the zinc is immersed either in dilute sulphuric acid or in
a solution of sulphate of zinc, and to prevent the solution of sulphate of cop-
per from mixing with this liquid, the two liquids are separated by a division
consisting of bladder or porous earthenware, which allows electrolysis to take
place through it, but effectually prevents mixture of the fluids by visible cur-
rents.

In some batteries sawdust is used to prevent currents. The experiments of
Graham, however, shew that the process of diffusion goes on nearly as rapidly
when two liquids are separated by a division of this kind as when they are
in direct contact, provided there are no visible currents, and it is probable
that if a septum is employed which diminishes the diffusion, it will increase
in exactly the same ratio the resistance of the element, because electrolytic
conduction is a process the mathematical laws of which have the same form
as those of diffusion, and whatever interferes with one must interfere equally
with the other. The only difference is that diffusion is always going on, while
the current flows only when the battery is in action.
In all forms of Daniell’s battery the final result is that the sulphate of cop-
per finds its way to the zinc and spoils the battery. To retard this result indef-
initely, Sir W. Thomson∗ has constructed Daniell’s battery in the form shewn
in Fig. 41.

In each cell the copper plate is placed horizontally at the bottom, and a
saturated solution of sulphate of zinc is poured over it. The zinc is in the
form of a grating and is placed horizontally near the surface of the solution. A

glass tube is placed vertically in the solution with its lower end just above the
surface of the copper plate. Crystals of sulphate of copper are dropped down
this tube, and, dissolving in the liquid, form a solution of greater density
than that of sulphate of zinc alone, so that it cannot get to the zinc except by
diffusion. To retard this process of diffusion, a siphon, consisting of a glass
tube stuffed with cotton wick, is placed with one extremity midway between
the zinc and copper, and the other in a vessel outside the cell, so that the
liquid is very slowly drawn off near the middle of its depth. To supply its
place, water, or a weak solution of sulphate of zinc, is added above when
required. In this way the greater part of the sulphate of copper rising through
the liquid by diffusion is drawn off by the siphon before it reaches the zinc,
and the zinc is surrounded by liquid nearly free from sulphate of copper, and
having a very slow downward motion in the cell, which still further retards
the upward motion of the sulphate of copper. During the action of the battery
copper is deposited on the copper plate, and SO4 travels slowly through the
liquid to the zinc with which it combines, forming sulphate of zinc. Thus
the liquid at the bottom becomes less dense by the deposition of the copper,
and the liquid at the top becomes more dense by the addition of the zinc. To
prevent this action from changing the order of density of the strata, and so

producing instability and visible currents in the vessel, care must be taken
to keep the tube well supplied with crystals of sulphate of copper, and to
feed the cell above with a solution of sulphate of zinc sufficiently dilute to
be lighter than any other stratum of the liquid in the cell.
Daniell’s battery is by no means the most powerful in common use. The
electromotive force of Grove’s cell is 192,000,000, of Daniell’s 107,900,000,
and that of Bunsen’s 188,000,000.

The resistance of Daniell’s cell is in general greater than that of Grove’s
or Bunsen’s of the same size. These defects, however, are more than coun-
terbalanced in all cases where exact measurements are required, by the fact
that Daniell’s cell exceeds every other known arrangement in constancy of
electromotive force. It has also the advantage of continuing in working order
for a long time, and of emitting no gas.
