People who use utility as the moral basis usually make the ignorant blunder of defining utility as being opposed to pleasure.

<!-- An apology is due to the philosophical opponents of utilitarianism, for even the momentary appearance of confounding them with any one capable of so absurd a misconception; which is the more extraordinary, inasmuch as the contrary accusation, of referring everything to pleasure, and that too in its grossest form, is another of the common charges against utilitarianism= 

and, as has been pointedly remarked by an able writer, the same sort of persons, and often the very same persons, denounce the theory "as impracticably dry when the word utility precedes the word pleasure, and as too practicably voluptuous when the word pleasure precedes the word utility."  -->

Pro-utility writers, from Epicurus to Bentham, defined it not something as different from pleasure, but pleasure itself. It includes an exemption from pain. 

<!-- ; and instead of opposing the useful to the agreeable or the ornamental, have always declared that the useful means these, among other things.  -->

Yet the common herd <!-- , including the herd of writers, not only in newspapers and periodicals, but in books of weight and pretension, are --> perpetually fall into this shallow mistake of separating utility and pleasure. 

<!-- Having caught up the word utilitarian, while knowing nothing whatever about it but its sound, they habitually express by it the rejection, or the neglect, of pleasure in some of its forms; of beauty, of ornament, or of amusement. 

Nor is the term thus ignorantly misapplied solely in disparagement, but occasionally in compliment; as though it implied superiority to frivolity and the mere pleasures of the moment. 

This perverted use is the only one in which the word is popularly known, and the one from which the new generation are acquiring their sole notion of its meaning. 

Those who introduced the word, but who had for many years discontinued it as a distinctive name, may well feel themselves called upon to resume it, if by doing so they can hope to contribute anything towards rescuing it from this utter degradation.[A]

<!-- The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or --> 

The Greatest Happiness Principle says that:
- actions which promote happiness are moral
- actions which produce the reverse of happiness are immoral 

Happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain. Unhappiness is pain and the privation of pleasure.

What things does my theory include in the ideas of pain and pleasure?

<!-- To what extent this is left an open question. But these supplementary explanations do not affect the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded—namely, that  -->

My theory is grounded on the following ideas:

- Pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as ends.
- All desirable things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any other scheme) are desirable either:
  - for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or
  - as means to promote pleasure and prevent pain.

Such a theory of life excites an inveterate dislike in many minds. 
<!-- , and among them in some of the most estimable in feeling and purpose, .  -->

People think that this means that life has no higher end than pleasure, and so they designate it as utterly mean and grovelling.
- They think it is a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early period, contemptuously likened
<!-- —no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit—;  -->
- Modern holders of the doctrine are occasionally compared in the same way by its German, French, and English assailants.

The Epicureans have always answered that it is their accusers who represent human nature in a degrading light since the accusation supposes human pleasures are the same as those of swine. 
 <!-- beings to be capable of no pleasures except those of which swine are capable.  -->

<!-- If this supposition were true, the charge could not be gainsaid, but would then be no longer an imputation; for if the sources of pleasure were precisely the same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good enough for the other.

The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading, precisely because a beast's pleasures do not satisfy a human being's conceptions of happiness. 
 -->

Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites. When once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification.

I do not consider the Epicureans faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences from the utilitarian principle. To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic and Christian elements must be included. 

But the Epicurean theory gives more value to pleasures of the intellect, the feelings, the imagination, and the moral sentiments than pleasures of mere sensation. 

But utilitarian writers in general have placed the superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, etc., of the former—that is, in their circumstantial advantages rather than in their intrinsic nature.

And on all these points utilitarians have fully proved their case. But they might have taken the other higher ground with entire consistency. 

<!-- It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognise the fact, that -->
