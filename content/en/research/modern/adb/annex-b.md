2. The seven (7) persons receiving the highest number of votes shall be Directors, except
that no person who received less than ten (10) per cent of the total voting power of regional members shall
be considered as elected.

3. If seven (7) persons are not elected at the first ballot, a second ballot shall be held in
which the person who received the lowest number of votes in the preceding ballot shall be ineligible and in
which votes shall be cast only by:

(a) Governors who voted in the preceding ballot for a person who is not elected; and
(b) Governors whose votes for a person who is elected are deemed, in accordance with
paragraph (4) of this Section, to have raised the votes cast for that person above eleven
(11) per cent of the total voting power of regional members.

In determining whether the votes-cast by a Governor shall be deemed to have
raised the total number of votes for any person above eleven (11) per cent, the said eleven (11) per cent
shall be deemed to include, first, the votes of the Governor casting the highest number of votes for that
person, and then, in diminishing order, the votes of each Governor casting the next highest number until
eleven (11) per cent is attained.
(b)
Any Governor, part of whose votes must be counted in order to raise the votes
cast for any person above ten (10) per cent, shall be considered as casting all his votes for that person even if the total number of votes cast for that person thereby exceeds eleven (11) per cent.

5.
If, after the second ballot, seven (7) persons are not elected, further ballots shall be held
in conformity with the principles and procedures laid down in this Section, except that after six (6) persons
are elected, the seventh may be elected -- notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Section --
by a simple majority of the remaining votes of regional members. All such remaining votes shall be
deemed to have counted towards the election of the seventh Director.
