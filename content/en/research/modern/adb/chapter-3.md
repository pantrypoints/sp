whose territory the project concerned is to be carried out (the latter currency hereinafter to be called "local
currency"), which are necessary to meet the foreign exchange costs of such project; or
(ii)
by providing financing to meet local expenditures on the project concerned, where it can
do so by supplying local currency without selling any of its holdings in gold or convertible currencies. In
special cases when, in the opinion of the Bank, the project causes or is likely to cause undue loss or strain
on the balance of payments of the member in whose territory the project is to be carried out, the financing
granted by the Bank to meet local expenditures may be provided in currencies other than that of such
member; in such cases, the amount of the financing granted by the Bank for this purpose shall not exceed a
reasonable portion of the total local expenditure incurred by the borrower.
