## Article 59: AMENDMENTS

1. This Agreement may be amended only by a resolution of the Board of Governors approved by a vote of 2/3 of the total number of Governors, representing not less than three-fourths
of the total voting power of the members.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, the unanimous agreement of the Board of Governors shall be required for the approval of any amendment modifying:

(i) the right to withdraw from the Bank;
(ii) the limitations on liability provided in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 5; and(iii)
the rights pertaining to purchase of capital stock provided in paragraph 2 of Article 5.

3. Any proposal to amend this Agreement, whether emanating from a member or the Board of Directors, shall be communicated to the Chairman of the Board of Governors, who shall bring the proposal before the Board of Governors. When an amendment has been adopted, the Bank shall so certify in an official communication addressed to all members. Amendments shall enter into force for all members three (3) months after the date of the official communication unless the Board of Governors specifies therein a different period.


## Article 60: INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION

1. Any question of interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement arising
between any member and the Bank, or between two or more members of the Bank, shall be submitted to the Board of Directors for decision. If there is no Director of its nationality on that Board, a member particularly affected by the question under consideration shall be entitled to direct representation in the Board of Directors during such consideration; the representative of such member shall, however, have no vote. Such right of representation shall be regulated by the Board of Governors.

2. In any case where the Board of Directors has given a decision under paragraph 1 of this
Article, any member may require that the question be referred to the Board of Governors, whose decision
shall be final. Pending the decision of the Board of Governors, the Bank may, so far as it deems necessary,
act on the basis of the decision of the Board of Directors.


## Article 61 ARBITRATION


If a disagreement should arise between the Bank and a country which has ceased to be a member,
or between the Bank and any member, after adoption of a resolution to terminate the operations of the Bank, such disagreement shall be submitted to arbitration by a tribunal of three arbitrators. 

One of the arbitrators shall be appointed by the Bank, another by the country concerned, and the third, unless the parties otherwise agree, by the President of the International Court of Justice or such other authority as may have been prescribed by regulations adopted by the Board of Governors. A majority vote of the arbitrators shall be sufficient to reach a decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties. The third arbitrator shall be empowered to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties are in disagreement
with respect thereto.


## Article 62 APPROVAL DEEMED GIVEN

Whenever the approval of any member is required before any act may be done by the Bank,
approval shall be deemed to have been given unless the member presents an objection within such
reasonable period as the Bank may fix in notifying the member of the proposed act.
