<!-- Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 (General Assembly resolution 217 A) as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected and it has been translated into over 500 languages. The UDHR is widely recognized as having inspired, and paved the way for, the adoption of more than seventy human rights treaties, applied today on a permanent basis at global and regional levels (all containing references to it in their preambles).

## Preamble

The foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world is the recognition of:
- the inherent dignity, and

Disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind. 

<!--  and the advent of a world in which  has been proclaimed as  -->

The highest aspiration of the common people is a world where:
- humans have the freedom of speech
- there is freedom from fear and want

Human rights should be protected by the rule of law. Otherwise, man will be compelled to rebel against tyranny and oppression.

Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the UN, the promotion of universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,

A common understanding of these rights and freedoms is needed to realize this pledge,



The General Assembly proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples.

Everyone should:
- keep this Declaration constantly in mind.
- strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international
- secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves

<!-- and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.  -->
