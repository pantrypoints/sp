<!-- T ALAL I TANIQ URAN -->

This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.


### The Righteous

{{< s v="3">}} The righteous are those who:
- believe in the unseen
- perform the prayers
- give from what We have provided for them.
- believe {{< s v="4" >}} in what was revealed to you
- are certain of the Hereafter.
- guided {{< s v="5" >}} from their Lord. 

These are the successful.


### The Fake Believers

{{< s v="6" >}} The disbelievers will disbelieve whether you have warned them or not.

{{< s v="7" >}} Enki has sealed their hearts and hearing. Their vision is a veil.
- They will have a severe torment.

{{< s v="8" >}} They will say: “We believe in Enki and in the Last Day.”
- But they are not believers.

{{< s v="9" >}} They seek to deceive Enki and those who believe. 
- But they only deceive themselves without them knowing it.

{{< s v="10" >}} In their hearts is sickness. 
- Enki has increased their sickness. 
- They will have a painful punishment because of their denial. 

{{< s v="11" >}} People say to them: “Do not make trouble on earth”
- But they will reply: “We are only reformers.”

{{< s v="12" >}} In fact, they are the troublemakers without them knowing it.

{{< s v="13" >}} They will say <!--  When it is said to them, “Believe as the people have believed,” they say, --> “We will not believe what fools have believed” 
- But in fact, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.

{{< s v="14" >}} Some will pretend to believe. But they will say to themselves: "We were only ridiculing"

<!-- 14. And when they come across those who believe, they say, “We believe”; but when they
are alone with their devils, they say, “We are with you; .” -->

{{< s v="15" >}} It is Enki who ridicules them, and leaves them bewildered in their transgression.

{{< s v="16" >}} They have bartered error for guidance. 
- But their trade does not profit them, and they are not guided.

{{< s v="17" >}} They are like a person lighting a fire. 
- Enki took away their light and left them in dark, unable to see.

{{< s v="18-19" >}} They are deaf, dumb, blind. 
- They will not return.

They are like a dark cloud with thunder and lightning. 
- They press their fingers into their ears from the thunderbolts, in fear of death. 
<!-- But Enki sur- rounds the disbelievers. -->
- The {{< s v="20" >}} lightning almost snatches their sight away. 
- Whenever it illuminates for them, they can walk
- But when it grows dark, they stand still. 

<!-- Had Enki willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight.
Enki is capable of everything.
21. O people! Worship your Lord who created
you and those before you, that you may attain
piety. -->
