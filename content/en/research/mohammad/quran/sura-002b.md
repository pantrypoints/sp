<!-- 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water
down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. -->


{{< s v="22">}} Enki sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Enki.
 <!-- Enki sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Enki. -->


{{< s v="23">}} If you doubt the Prophet Mohammad, then call your witnesses if you are truthful.
- But {{< s v="24">}} you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
<!-- 23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter like these, and  -->

{{< s v="25">}} To those who believe and do righteous deeds, give the good news that they will:
- have gardens beneath which rivers flow
- be provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance<!-- , they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will --> 
- have pure spouses there who will live with them forever.

<!-- 26. Enki does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As

{{< s v="26">}} The disbelievers will say: “What did Enki intend by this example?” He leads many astray and guides many.

Reply that <!-- thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He --> Enki misleads only the evildoers.

{{< s v="27">}} The losers are those who:
- violate Enki’s covenant after its confirmation
- sever what Enki has commanded to be joined
- commit evil on earth

{{< s v="28">}} Enki:
- gave you life*
- will put you to death
- will bring you to life
- return you to Himself

{{< n n="According to 'Enki and Ninhursaja', Enki created man from Homo Erectus via genetic engineering" >}}


How can you deny Enki?

{{< s v="29">}} He:
- created for you everything on earth
- then turned to the heaven and made them 7 heavens

{{< s v="30">}} Enki said to the angels that He is placing a successor on earth.*

{{< n n="This is because the Anunnaki had to move on" >}}

The agents of Enki [angels] said:

{{< r a="Enki Agents" >}}
Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I know what you do not know.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="31">}} He taught Adam the names, all of them. Then he presented them to his agents [angels], and said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enki Agents" >}}
<sup>32</sup> Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.*
{{< /r >}}

{{< n n="In 'Enki and Ninhursaja', Enki is described as 'The wise and intelligent one, the prudent, the fashioner of the design of everything brought to life' ">}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>33</sup> O Adam, tell them their names.
{{< /l >}}

After he told them their names, He said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>33</sup> Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>34</sup> [To the Agents:] Bow down to Adam
{{< /l >}}


They bowed down, except for Satan [Enlil]. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

{{< s v="35">}} We said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
O Adam, inhabit the Garden with your spouse. Eat from it freely as you please. But do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="36">}} But Enlil caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in.

We said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Go down, some of you enemies of one another. You will have residence on earth and enjoyment for a while.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="37">}} Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him.

{{< s v="38-39">}} We said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance—they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire—wherein they will remain forever.” -->
