{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}


{{< s v="40-46">}} O Jews:
- remember the blessings I, Enki, gave you
- fulfill your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge to you
- fear Me
- believe in what I revealed
- do not exchange My revelations for a small price
- be conscious of Me
- do not mix truth with falsehood
- do not conceal the truth while you know.
- attend to your prayers
- practice regular charity
- kneel with those who kneel
- command people to virtuous conduct
- forget yourselves even though you read the Scripture
- seek help through patience and prayer

But these are difficult, except for the devout.

<!-- 46. Those who know that they will meet their
Lord, and that to Him they will return. -->

{{< s v="47-52">}} O Jews:
- remember <!-- My favor which I bestowed upon you, and I  -->that I favored you over all nations*
- beware of a Day when no soul will avail another in the least, nor will any intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any ransom be taken from it, nor will they be helped.

{{< n n="The Jews were the Atlanteans who were the most religious. They migrated by Noah's ark from the Bahamas into the Middle East. This is why 25% of Latinos have Jewish DNA. Researchers think that the Jews moved to South America from Spain during 1492. In reality, it is the Jews who migrated from Central America." >}}


We:
- delivered you from the Egyptians* who inflicted terrible persecution on you, killing your sons, and sparing your women. 
- parted the sea for you, saving you
- drowned the Egyptians as you looked on
- appointed for Moses 40 nights. 
  - You worshipped the calf after him, and you turned wicked.
  - We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful. 
- gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion to guide you.

{{< n n="The Egyptians were allied with Enlil and were defending themselves against the evil Enki-backed Atlanteans when the comet struck." >}}


Moses said: 

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My people, you have done wrong to yourselves by worshiping the calf [that represents Enlil]. So repent to your Maker [Enki] and kill your egos.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see Enki plainly.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- So He turned to you in repentance. He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful. -->

Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you, as you looked on. Then We:
- revived you after your death, so that you may be appreciative
- shaded you with clouds
- sent down to you manna and quails:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Eat of the good things We have provided for you.
{{< /l >}}


They did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong their own souls.

We said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Enter this town, and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish. But enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.' We will forgive your sins, and give increase to the virtuous.” 
{{< /l >}}


But the wrongdoers among them substituted words other than those given to them, so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague from heaven, because of their wicked behavior.


When Moses prayed for water for his people, We said

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Strike the rock with your staff.
{{< /l >}}


Thereupon 12 springs gushed out from it. Each tribe recognized its drinking-place. 

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Eat and drink from Enki’s provision. Do not corrupt the earth with disobedience.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Moses, we cannot just eat one kind of food. So call to your Lord to produce for us other food like herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, onions.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
<!-- He said, “Would you substitute worse for better?  -->
Go back to Egypt where you will have such food. 
{{< /l >}}


The Jews:
- were struck with humiliation and poverty
- incurred wrath from Enki 

This is because they rejected Enki’s revelations and wrongfully killed the prophets. 


{{< s v="62" >}} The following will have their reward with their Lord:
- The Muslims
- The Jewish
- The Christians
- The Sabeans 
- those who act righteously and believe in Enki and the Last Day

{{< s v="63" >}} We received a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Take what We have given you earnestly, and remember what is in it, that you may attain righteousness.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="64" >}} But after that you turned away. Were it not for Enki’s grace and mercy towards you, you would have been among the losers.

{{< s v="65" >}} We said to those of you who violated the Sabbath: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Be despicable apes!*
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="This is because, without Enki, humans would remain as Homo Erectus" >}}


{{< s v="66" >}} Thus, We made it:
- a deterrent for their generation and subsequent generations, and
- a lesson for the righteous.

{{< s v="67-71" >}} Recall when Moses said to his people:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Enki commands you to sacrifice a cow
{{< /l >}}
 
{{< r a="Jews">}}
Are you mocking us?* Call on your Lord to show us which one.
{{< /r >}}

{{< n n="*The cow is sacred to Hindus which were allied with Enlil" >}}


{{< l a="Moses" >}}
He says she is a cow, neither too old, nor too young, but in between. So do what you are commanded
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews">}}
Tell your Lord to show us what her color is
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
He says she is a yellow* cow, bright in color, pleasing to the beholders
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="*The Anunnaki were searching for gold" >}}

{{< r a="Jews">}}
Tell your Lord to show us which one. The cows look alike to us. We want to be guided
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
He says she is a cow, neither yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the field; sound without blemish.
{{< /l >}}

So they slaughtered the cow, though they almost did not.

{{< s v="72-73" >}} Recall when you killed a man and disputed about it. But Enki was to expose what you were hiding. 

We said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Strike him with part of the cow. [And the murdered man came back to life]
{{< /l >}}

Thus, Enki brings the dead to life.

<!-- ; and He shows you His signs, that you may understand. -->

{{< s v="74" >}} After that your hearts hardened.
- They were as rocks, or even harder.
- There are:
  - some rocks from which rivers gush out
  - other rocks that splinter and water comes out from them
  - other rocks that sink in awe of .

<sup>75.</sup> Do you hope that they will believe in you, when some of them used to hear the Word of Enki, and then deliberately distort it, even after understanding it?

<sup>76.</sup> When they come across those who believe, they say

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
We believe
{{< /r >}}

But when they come together privately, they say:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
What did Enki tell you? So that we can dispute it with our Lord Enlil.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>77.</sup> Do they not know that Enki knows what they conceal and what they reveal?

<sup>78.</sup> Among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay. They only speculate.

<sup>79.</sup> So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Enki,” that they may exchange it for a little price. 

Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.

<sup>80</sup> They say:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.
{{< /r >}}


Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Have you received a promise from Enki? Enki never breaks His promise. Or are you saying about Enki what you do not know?”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>81.</sup> Whoever commits misdeeds, and becomes besieged by his iniquities—these are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.

<!-- 82. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, wherein they will dwell forever. -->
