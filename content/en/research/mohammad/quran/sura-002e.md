{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}


{{< s v="124-126" >}} After the Lord tested Abraham, He said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I am making you a leader of humanity.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
What about my descendants?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
My pledge does not include the wrongdoers.

We made the Kabah a focal point and sanctuary for the people. Use the shrine of Abraham as a place of prayer.

We commissioned Abraham and Ishmael to sanctify My House for those who:
- circle around it
- seclude themselves in it, and
- kneel and prostrate.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
O My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and provide its people with fruits—whoever of them believes in Enki and the Last Day.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Whoever disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, then I will consign him to the the Fire
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="127-129" >}} Abraham raised the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael.

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
Lord, accept it from us.
- Make us submissive to You.
- Fom our descendants, make a [Muslim] nation submissive to You.
- Show us our rites
- Accept our repentance. 
- <sup>129</sup> Raise up among them a messenger who will:
  - recite to them Your revelations
  - teach them the Book and wisdom
  - purify them. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="130-131" >}} Only fools would forsake the religion of Abraham. We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Abraham, Submit!
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds. O my sons, <!-- and to Jacob --> Enki has chosen this religion for you, so do not die unless you have submitted.
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="133" >}} When death approached Jacob, he said to his sons:

{{< l a="Jacob" >}}
What will you worship after Me?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
We will worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac; One God; and to Him we submit.
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="134" >}} That was how the nation was formed. They have earned what they have earned, just as you will earn what you will earn. You will not be
questioned about what they used to do.

{{< s v="135" >}} The Jews and Christians say: 

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Be Jews or Christians, and you will be guided.
{{< /r >}}

We follow the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was not an idolater. {{< s v="136" >}} We believe in:
- Enki and in what was revealed to us and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs
- what was given to Moses and Jesus
- what was given to the prophets—from their Lord. 
- We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we surrender.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="137-138" >}} If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. 
- But if they turn away, then they are in schism. 
- Enki will protect you against them.

<!-- 138. Enki’s coloring. And who gives better coloring than Enki? “And we are devoted to Him.” -->

Do you argue with us about Enki? 
- Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or Christians?
<!-- , when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We
have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?” -->
- Do you know better than Enki?
- Anyone who conceals a testimony from Enki does more wrong.

<!-- 141. That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is
what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
