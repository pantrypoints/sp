{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}


{{< s v="168" >}} Eat of what is lawful and good on earth. 

Do not follow the footsteps of Satan [Enlil], an open enemy. {{< s v="169" >}} He commands you to:
- do evil and vice
- say about Enki what you do not know.

Satan's followers will say:  {{< s v="168" >}} <!-- And when it is said to them, “Follow what Enki has revealed,” they say, --> 


{{< r a="Enlil Followers" >}}
We follow what we found our ancestors following.
{{< /r >}}


This is even if their ancestors understood nothing, and were not guided. 

{{< s v="171" >}} The parable of those who disbelieve is that of someone who calls on someone who hears nothing except screaming and yelling.

Deaf, dumb, and blind—they do not understand.


{{< s v="172-173" >}} Muslims, <!--  Eat of the good things We have provided for you, and give thanks to
Enki, if it is Him that you serve. --> Enki has forbidden you from eating:
- carrion
- blood
- the flesh of swine
- animals that were dedicated to other than Enki.

But if anyone is compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he commits no sin.


{{< s v="174" >}} Those who conceal what Enki revealed in the Book, and exchange it for a small price— those swallow nothing but fire into their bellies. 

<!-- And Enki will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment. -->

{{< s v="175" >}} It is they who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for punishment. 

But why do they insist on the Fire?

{{< s v="176" >}} That is because Enki has revealed the Book in truth. Those who differ about the
Book are in deep discord.

{{< s v="177" >}} Righteousness does not consist of turning your faces towards the East and the West. 

But righteous is he who believes in:
- Enki
- the Last Day
- the angels
- the Scripture
- the prophets

The sincere and pious are those who:
- give money, though dear, to near relatives, orphans, the needy, homeless, beggars, and for the freeing of slaves
- perform the prayers
- pay the obligatory charity
- fulfill their promise when they promise
- patiently persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and conflict. 


{{< s v="178" >}} Muslims, the following are are ordained on you:
- retaliation for the murdered
- the free for the free
- the slave for the slave
- the female for the female

But if he is forgiven by his kin, then:
- grant any reasonable demand, and
- pay with good will. 

This is a concession from your Lord, and a mercy. 

But whoever commits aggression after that, a painful torment awaits him.


{{< s v="179" >}} There is life for you in retaliation so that you may refrain.

{{< s v="180" >}} It is decreed for you: when death approaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to make a testament in favor of the parents and the relatives, fairly and correctly—a duty on the righteous.

{{< s v="181" >}} But whoever changes it after he has heard it, the guilt is upon those who change it.

{{< s v="182" >}} Should someone suspect bias or injustice on the part of a testator, and then reconciles between them, he commits no sin. 


## Fasting

{{< s v="183" >}} Muslims, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become righteous.

{{< s v="184" >}} For a specified number of days. 

But whoever among you is sick, or on a journey, then a number of other days. 

For those who are able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. 

But whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for him. But to fast is best for you.


{{< s v="185" >}}  Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed. 

Guidance for humanity, and clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. 

Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey,
then a number of other days. 

Enki desires ease for you, and does not desire hardship for you, that you may complete the number, and celebrate Enki for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.

{{< s v="186" >}} When My servants ask you about Me, I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and have faith in Me, that they may be rightly guided.


{{< s v="187" >}} Sex with your wives on the night of the fast is allowed. 
- They are a garment for you
- You are a garment for them

Enki knows that you used to betray yourselves, but He turned to you and pardoned you. 

So approach your wives now, and seek what Enki has ordained for you. 

Eat and drink until the white streak of dawn can be distinguished from the black streak. 

Then complete the fast until nightfall. 

But do not approach your wives while you are in retreat at the mosques. 

These are the limits of Enki, so do not come near them. 

Enki thus clarifies His revelations to the people, that they may attain piety.

{{< s v="188" >}} Do not consume one another’s wealth by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the officials in order to consume part of other people’s wealth illicitly, while you know. 

{{< s v="189" >}} They ask you about the crescents. 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
They are timetables for people, and for the Hajj.
{{< /l >}}


It is not virtuous that you approach homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pious. 

So approach homes from their doors, and observe Enki, that you may succeed.
