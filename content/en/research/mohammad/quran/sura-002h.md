{{< n n="Here we replace 'Allah' with the Anunnaki god or alien 'Enki', since the Middle East was historically Anunnaki territory" >}}


{{< s v="190" >}} Fight in the cause of Enki those who fight you.* 
- But do not commit aggression.
- Enki does not love the aggressors.

{{< n n="*The Atlanteans, supported by Enki, were known to start wars" >}}



{{< s v="191" >}} Kill them wherever you overtake them
- Expel them from where they had expelled you. 

Oppression is more serious than murder. 
- But do not fight them at the Kabbah unless they fight you there. 

If they fight you, then kill them. <!-- Such is the retribution of the disbelievers. -->

{{< s v="192" >}} But if they cease, then Enki is Forgiving and Merciful.

{{< s v="193" >}} Fight them until there is no oppression, and worship becomes devoted to Enki alone. 

But if they cease, then let there be no hostility except against the oppressors.


{{< s v="194" >}} The sacred month for the sacred month;

Sacrilege calls for retaliation. 

Whoever commits aggression against you, retaliate against him in the same measure as he has committed against you. 

<!-- Bbe conscious of
Enki, and know that Enki is with the right-
eous.
 -->

{{< s v="195" >}}  Spend in the cause of Enki. 
- Do not throw yourselves with your own hands into ruin
- Be charitable.

{{< s v="196" >}} Carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for Enki. 

But if you are prevented, then whatever is feasible of offerings.

Do not shave your heads until the offering has reached its destination. 

Whoever of you is sick, or has an injury of the head, then redemption of fasting, or charity, or worship. When you are secure: whoever continues the Umrah until the Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. 

But if he lacks the means, then fasting for 3 days during the Hajj and 7 when you have returned, making 10 in all. 

This is for he whose household is not present at the Kabbah. 

{{< s v="197" >}} The Hajj is during specific months. 

Whoever decides to perform the Hajj—there shall be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor quarrelling during the Hajj. 

Take provisions. The best provision is righteousness.

<!-- Be mindful of Me. -->


<sup>198.</sup> You commit no error by seeking bounty from your Lord. 

When you disperse from Arafat, remember Enki at the Sacred Landmark. And remember Him as He has guided you. 

<!-- Although, before that, you were of those astray. -->

<sup>199.</sup> Then disperse from where the people disperse, and ask Enki for forgiveness.

<sup>200.</sup> When you have completed your rites, remember Enki as you remember your parents, or even more. 

Among the people is he who says:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Lord, give us in this world
{{< /r >}}

Yet he has no share in the Hereafter.


<sup>201.</sup> Among them is he who says:

{{< r a="Muslims" >}}
Lord, give us goodness in this world, and goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>202.</sup> These will have a share of what they have earned. Enki is swift in reckoning.

<sup>203.</sup> Remember Enki during the designated days. But whoever hurries on in 2 days commits no wrong, and whoever stays on commits no wrong—provided he maintains righteousness. 


<sup>204.</sup> Among the people is he whose speech about the worldly life impresses you, and he calls Enki to witness what is in his heart, while he is the most hostile of adversaries.

<sup>205.</sup> When he gains power, he strives to spread corruption on earth, destroying properties and lives. Enki does not like corruption.

<sup>206.</sup> When he is told, “Beware of Enki,” his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is enough for him—a dreadful abode. 

<sup>207.</sup> Among the people is he who sells himself seeking Enki’s approval.
