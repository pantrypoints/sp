{{< s v="228">}} Divorced women shall wait by themselves for 3 periods. 

- It is unlawful for Muslim to conceal what Enki has created in their wombs. <!-- , if they believe in Enki and the Last Day. --> 
- Their husbands have the better right to take them back, if they desire reconciliation. 

Women have rights similar to their obligations, according to what is fair.
- But men have a degree over them. 


{{< s v="229">}} Divorce is allowed twice. 

Then, either honorable retention, or setting free kindly. 

It is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given them, unless they fear that
they cannot maintain Enki's limits. 

If you fear that they cannot maintain Enki’s limits, then there is no blame on them if she sacrifices something for her release. 

These are Enki’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those who transgress Enki’s limits are the unjust.


{{< s v="230" >}} If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful for him again until she has married another husband. 

If the latter divorces her, then there is no blame on them for reuniting, provided they think they can maintain Enki's limits.

<!-- These are Enki’s limits; He makes them clear
to people who know. -->

{{< s v="231">}} When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, either retain them amicably, or release them amicably. 

But do not retain them to hurt them and commit aggression. Whoever does that has wronged himself. 

<!-- And do not take Enki’s revelations for a joke. 
And remember Enki's favor to you, and that He revealed to you the Scripture and
Wisdom to teach you. fear Enki, and
know that Enki is aware of everything. -->

{{< s v="232">}} When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, do not prevent them from marrying their husbands, provided they agree on fair terms. 

Thereby is advised whoever among you believes in Enki and the Last Day. 

That is better and more decent for you.

{{< s v="233">}} Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to complete the nursing-period.

It is the duty of the father to provide for them and clothe them in a proper manner. 

No soul shall be burdenedbeyond its capacity. 

No mother shall be harmed on account of her child, and no father shall be harmed on account of his child.

The same duty rests upon the heir. 

If the couple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing
so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. 


{{< s v="234">}} As for those among you who die and leave widows behind, their widows shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days. 

When they have reached their term, there is no blame on you regarding what they might
honorably do with themselves. Enki is fully acquainted with what you do.


{{< s v="235">}} You commit no error by announcing your engagement to women, or by keeping it to yourselves. 

Enki knows that you will be thinking about them. But do not meet them secretly, unless you have something proper to say. 

Do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled. 

<!-- And know that Al-
lah knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him. And know that Enki is Forgiving and
Forbearing. -->


{{< s v="236" >}} It is alright to divorce women before having touched them, or before having set the dowry for them.

Compensate them—the wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means—with a fair compensation, a duty upon the doers of good.


{{< s v="237">}} If you divorce them before you have touched them, but after you had set the dowry for them, give them half of what you specified—unless they forego the right, or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety.

Do not forget generosity between one another. <!-- Enki is seeing of everything you do. -->

{{< s v="238" >}} Guard your prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand before Enki in devotion.

{{< s v="239" >}} But if you are in fear, then on foot, or riding. 

When you are safe, remember Enki, as He taught you what you did not know.

{{< s v="240" >}} Those of you who die and leave wives behind—a will shall provide their wives with support for a year, provided they do not leave. 

If they leave, you are not to blame for what they do with themselves, provided it is reasonable. 

{{< s v="241" >}} Divorced women shall be provided for, equitably—a duty upon the righteous.
<!-- 242. Enki thus explains His revelations to you,
so that you may understand.
 -->

{{< s v="243" >}} Have you not considered those who fled their homes, by the thousands, fearful of death? 

Enki said to them, “Die.” Then He revived them. 


245. Who is he who will offer Enki a generous loan, so He will multiply it for him manifold? Enki receives and amplifies, and to Him you
will be returned.
