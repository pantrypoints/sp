{{< s v="246">}} Have you not considered the notables of the Jews after Moses? 


{{< r a="Jews" >}}
[To a Jewish prophet:] Appoint a king for us, and we will fight in the cause of Enki.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
Are you sure?
{{< /l >}} 

<!-- He said, “Is it possible that, if fighting was ordained for you, you would not fight?” -->

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Why would we not fight in the cause of Enki, when we were driven out of our homes, along with our children?
{{< /r >}}

But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. 


{{< s v="247" >}} 

<!-- Their prophet said to them,  -->

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
To the Jews: Enki has appointed Saul to be your king.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
How can Saul have authority over us, when we are more worthy of authority than he, and he was not given plenty of wealth?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
Enki has chosen him over you, and has increased him in knowledge and stature.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="248" >}}

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
The proof of his kingship is:
- that the Ark will be restored to you, bringing tranquility from your Lord, and
- relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron. 

It will be carried by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you are believers.”
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="249" >}} When Saul set out with the troops, he said:

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
Enki will be testing you with a river. Whoever drinks from it does not belong with me. 

But whoever does not drink from it, does belong with me, except for whoever scoops up a little with his hand.
{{< /l >}}


But most of them drank from it. Then, when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said:

{{< r a="Troops" >}}
We have no strength to face Goliath and his troops today.
{{< /r >}}

But those who knew that they would meet Enki said:

{{< r a="Troops" >}}
How many a small group has defeated a large group by Enki’s will.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>250</sup> When they confronted Goliath and his troops, they said:

{{< r a="Troops" >}}
Lord,:
- pour down patience on us,
- strengthen our foothold, and
- support us against the faithless people.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>251-252</sup> They defeated them by Enki’s leave. David killed Goliath. Enki gave him sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as He willed. 

Were it not for Enki restraining the people, some by means of others, the earth would have gone to ruin. 

<!-- 252. These are Enki’s revelations, which We
recite to you in truth. You are one of the mes-
sengers. -->

<sup>253</sup> These messengers: We gave some advantage over others. To some of them Enki spoke directly, and some He raised in rank.

We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles. We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had Enki willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought one another, after the clear signs had come to them. 

But they disputed. Some of them believed, and some of them disbelieved. 

Had Enki willed, they would not have fought one another.

<sup>254-255</sup> Muslims, Spend from what We have given you, before a Day comes in which there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor intercession. 


<!-- 255. Enki! There is no god except He, the Living, the Everlasting. Neither slumber overtakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every-
thing in the heavens and everything on earth.

Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows what is before them, and what is behind them; and they cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does
not burden Him. He is the Most High, the Great. -->

<sup>256-257</sup> There shall be no compulsion in religion. The right way has become distinct from the wrong way. 

<!-- Whoever renounces evil and believes in Enki has grasped the most trustworthy handle; which does not break. -->

<!-- 257. Enki is the Lord of those who believe; He brings them out of darkness and into light. As
for those who disbelieve, their lords are the evil ones; they bring them out of light and
into darkness—these are the inmates of the Fire, in which they will abide forever. -->

{{< s v="258" >}} A blasphemer argued with Abraham about his Lord, because Enki had given him sovereignty.

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
My Lord is He who gives life and causes death. Enki brings the sun from the East, so bring it from the West
{{< /l >}}

<!-- {{< l a="Enki" >}}
I give life and cause death.
{{< /l >}} -->

{{< r a="Blasphemer" >}}
How can Enki revive a collapsed town after its demise?
{{< /r >}}

<!-- The blasphemer was confounded.  Or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations.  -->

Thereupon Enki caused Abraham to die for 100 years, and then resurrected him. 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
How long have you tarried?” 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
I have tarried for a day, or part of a day.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
No. You have tarried for 100 years.  Now look at your food and your drink—it has not spoiled. Look at your donkey. We will make you a wonder for mankind. 

Look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then clothe them with flesh.
{{< /l >}}

So when it became clear to him, he said:

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
I know that Enki has power over all things.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>260</sup> My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- He said, “Have you not believed?” 
He said, “Yes, but to put my heart at ease.”  -->

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Take 4 birds, and incline them to yourself, then place a part on each hill, then call to them. They will come rushing to you. 
{{< /l >}}
