{{< s v="156" >}} The disbelievers said of their brethren who went on the offensive: “Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed. <!-- So that Enki
may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. -->

Muslims, do not be like the disbelievers. 


{{< s v="157" >}} If you are killed in the cause of Enki, to Enki you will be gathered up. <!-- —forgiveness and mercy from Enki are better than what they hoard. -->


{{< s v="159">}}  It is by of grace from Enki that you were gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the conduct of affairs. 

When you make a decision, put your trust in Enki. 

<sup>160</sup> If Enki supports you, there is none who can overcome you. 

But if He fails you, who is there to help you after Him? So in Enki let the believers put their trust.

<sup>161.</sup> It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly.

Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.

<sup>162.</sup> Is someone who pursues Enki's approval the same as someone who incurs Enki's
wrath and his refuge is Hell—the miserable destination?

<sup>163.</sup> They have different ranks with Enki, and Enki is Seeing of what they do.

<sup>164.</sup> Enki has blessed the believers, as He raised up among them a messenger from among themselves, who:
- recites to them His revelations
- purifies them
- teaches them the Scripture and wisdom

This is even if before that they were in evident error.

<sup>165</sup> When a calamity* befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you said, “How is this?” 

{{< n n="*This is the comet that destroyed Atlantis" >}}

Say: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
It is from your own selves.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>166</sup> What befell you on the day the two armies* clashed was with Enki’s permission; that He may know the believers and <sup>167</sup> the hypocrites

{{< n n="*The 2 armies were the Atlanteans versus the Greeks" >}}


It was said to them:

{{< r a="Enki Agents" >}}
Come, fight in the cause of Enki, or contribute.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If we knew how to fight, we would have followed you.
{{< /r >}}

On that day, they were closer to infidelity than they were to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. But Enki knows what they hide.


<sup>168</sup> Those who said of their brethren, as they stayed behind:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.
{{< /r >}}

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Then avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>169</sup> Do not consider those killed in the cause of Enki as dead. 

In fact, they are alive, at their Lord, well provided for.

<sup>170</sup> Delighting in what Enki has given them out of His grace, and happy for those who have not yet joined them. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.

<sup>171</sup> They rejoice in grace from Enki, and bounty, and that Enki will not waste the reward of the faithful.

<sup>172</sup> Those who responded to Enki and the Messenger, despite the persecution they had suffered. 

For the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward.

<sup>173</sup> Those to whom the people have said, “The people have mobilized against you, so fear them.” 

But this only increased them in faith, and they said, “Enki is enough for us; He is the Excellent Protector.”

<sup>174</sup> So they came back with grace from Enki, and bounty, and no harm having touched them. 

They pursued what pleases Enki. Enki possesses immense grace.

<sup>175</sup> That is only Satan [Enlil] frightening his partisans. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.

<sup>176</sup> Do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm Enki in the least. 

<!-- Enki desires to give them no
share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment
awaits them. -->

<sup>177</sup> Those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm Enki in the least. A painful torment awaits them.

<sup>178</sup> Those who disbelieve should not assume that We respite them for their own good.

In fact, We only respite them so that they may increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment awaits them.

<sup>179</sup> Enki will not leave the believers as you are, without distinguishing the wicked from the sincere.

Nor will Enki inform you of the future, but Enki elects from among His messengers whom He wills. 

So believe in Enki and His messengers. If you believe and practice piety, you will have a splendid reward.

<sup>180</sup> Those who withhold what Enki has given them of his bounty should not assume that is good for them. In fact, it is bad for them. 

They will be encircled by their hoardings on the Day of Resurrection. To Enki belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and Enki is well acquainted with what you do.

<sup>181</sup> Enki has heard the statement of those who said:

{{< r a="People" >}}
Enki is poor, and we are rich.
{{< /r >}}

We will write down what they said. Their wrongful killing of the prophets. We will say:

{{< l a="Enki Agents" >}}
Taste the torment of the burning. <sup>182</sup> This is on account of what your hands have forwarded, and because Enki is not unjust towards the creatures.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>183</sup> Some said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Enki has made a covenant with us, that we shall not believe in any messenger unless he brings us an offering to be consumed by fire.
{{< /r >}}

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Messengers have come to you before me with proofs, and with what you asked for; so why did you assassinate them, if you are truthful?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>184</sup> If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying. 

They came with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Scripture.

<sup>185</sup> Every soul will have a taste of death, and you will receive your recompense on the Day of Resurrection. 

Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.

<sup>186</sup> You will be tested through your possessions and your persons. 

You will hear from those who received the Scripture before you, and from the idol worshipers, much abuse. 

But if you persevere and lead a righteous life—that indeed is a mark of great determination.

<sup>187</sup> Enki received a pledge from those who were given the Scripture: 

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
You shall proclaim it to the people, and not conceal it.
{{< /r >}}

But they disregarded it behind their backs, and exchanged it for a small price. What a miserable exchange they made!

<sup>188</sup> Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done—do not think they can evade the punishment. 

<!-- <sup>189</sup> To Enki belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Enki has power over all things.

<sup>190</sup> In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, are signs for people of understanding. -->

<sup>191</sup> Those who remember Enki while standing, and sitting, and on their sides. 

They reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: 

{{< r a="Muslims" >}}
Our Lord, You did not create this in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the punishment of the Fire. 

<sup>193</sup> Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit our misdeeds, and make us die in the company of the virtuous. 

<sup>194</sup> Our Lord, and give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Surely You never break a promise.
{{< /r >}}


<!-- 192. “Our Lord, whomever You commit to the Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers will have no helpers.” -->


<sup>195</sup> Their Lord answered them: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female. You are one of another. 

For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and fought and were killed—I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow—a reward from Enki.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>196-197</sup> Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ movements in the land. A brief enjoyment, then their abode is Hell.

<sup>198</sup> Those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever—hospitality from Enki. What Enki possesses is best for the just.

<sup>199</sup> Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Enki, and in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They are humble before Enki, and they do not sell Enki’s revelations for a cheap price. These will have their reward with their Lord.<!--  Enki is swift in reckoning. -->

<sup>200</sup> For you to thrive:
- Be patient and advocate patience
- Be united
- Revere Enki
