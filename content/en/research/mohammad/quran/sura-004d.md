{{< s v="69" >}} Whoever obeys Enki and the Messenger are blessed by Enki. 

They are together with:
- the prophets
- the sincere,
- the martyrs, and
- the upright. 

Excellent are those as companions.

<!-- 70. That is the grace from Enki. Enki suffices
as Knower. -->


{{< s v="71" >}} Take your precautions
- Mobilize in groups or mobilize altogether.

{{< s v="72" >}} Among you is he who lags behind. Then, when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Enki has favored me, that I was not martyred with them.”

{{< s v="73" >}} But when some bounty from Enki comes to you, he says—as if no affection existed between you and him—“If only I had been with them, I would have achieved a great victory.”

{{< s v="74" >}} Let those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the cause of Enki.

Whoever fights in the cause of Enki, and then is killed, or achieves victory, We will grant him a great compensation.

{{< s v="75" >}} Why would you not fight in the cause of Enki, and the helpless men, and women, and children, cry out:

{{< l a="Woman" >}}
Our Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are oppressive, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Protector, and appoint for us from Your Presence a Victor.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="76" >}} Those who believe fight in the cause of Enki, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Evil. 

So fight the allies of the Devil [Enlil]. Surely the strategy of the Devil [Enlil] is weak.

{{< s v="77" >}} Have you not considered those who were told: 

“Restrain your hands, and perform your prayers, and spend in regular charity”? 

But when fighting was ordained for them, a faction of them feared the people as Enki should be feared, or even more. 

They said:

“Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting for us? If only You would postpone it for us for a short while.” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
The enjoyments of this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better for the righteous, and you will not be wronged one bit.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="78" >}} Wherever you may be, death will catch up with you, even if you were in fortified towers.

When a good fortune comes their way, they say, “This is from Enki.” 

But when a misfortune befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslim" >}}
All is from Enki
{{< /l >}}


So what is the matter with these people, that they hardly understand a thing?

{{< s v="79" >}} Whatever good happens to you is from Enki, and whatever bad happens to you is from your own self. We sent you to humanity as a messenger, and Enki is Witness enough.

{{< s v="80" >}} Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying Enki. 
- Whoever turns away, We did not send the Messenger for them.

{{< s v="81" >}} They profess obedience.
- But when they leave your presence, some of them conspire something contrary to what you said. 
- But Enki writes down what they conspire. 
- So avoid them, and put your trust in Enki.

{{< s v="82" >}} Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it been from any other than Enki, they would
have found in it much discrepancy. 


{{< s v="83" >}}  When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. 

Were it not for Enki’s blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.

{{< s v="84" >}}  So fight in the cause of Enki.
- You are responsible only for yourself.
- Rouse the believers. 
- Perhaps Enki will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. <!-- Enki is Stronger in
Might, and More Punishing. -->

{{< s v="85" >}}  Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it. 

Whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. 
<!-- Enki keeps watch over everything. -->


{{< s v="86" >}} When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. 

<!-- Enki keeps count of everything. -->

{{< s v="87" >}}  Enki will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. <!-- And who speaks more truly than Enki? -->
