{{< s v="88" >}} You are divided into 2 factions regarding the hypocrites. 
<!-- - But Enki Himself has overwhelmed them on account of what they did. 
- Do you want to guide those whom Enki has led astray? 
- You will never find a way for whomever Enki leads astray. -->
- {{< s v="89" >}}  They would love to see you disbelieve, just as they disbelieve, so you would become equal. 
- So do not befriend any of them, unless they emigrate in the way of Enki. 
- If they turn away, seize them and execute them wherever you may find them. 
- Do not take from among them allies or supporters.

{{< s v="90" >}} Except those who join people with whom you have a treaty, or those who come to you reluctant to fight you or fight their own people. Had Enki willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. 

If they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Enki assigns no excuse for you against them.


{{< s v="91" >}} You will find others who want security from you, and security from their own people. But whenever they are tempted into civil discord, they plunge into it.

So seize them and execute them wherever you find them if they do not:
- withdraw from you
- offer you peace, nor
- restrain their hands.

Against these, We have given you clear authorization.

{{< s v="92" >}} Never should a believer kill another believer, unless by error.
- Anyone who kills a believer by error must:
  - set free a believing slave, and
  - pay compensation to the victim’s family, unless they remit it as charity. 

If the victim belonged to a people who are hostile to you, but is a believer, then the compensation is to free a believing slave. 

If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty, then:
- compensation should be handed over to his family, and
- a believing slave set free. 

Anyone who lacks the means must fast for 2 consecutive months as repentance to Enki. 

{{< s v="93" >}} Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the penalty is Hell forever. 

<!-- And Enki will be angry with him, and will curse him, and will prepare for him a terrible punishment. -->

{{< s v="94" >}}  When you journey in the way of Enki, investigate. 
- Do not say to him who offers you peace, “You are not a believer,” aspiring for the goods of this world. <!-- With Enki are abundant riches.  -->
- You yourselves were like this before, and Enki bestowed favor on you.
- So investigate. <!-- Enki is well aware of what you do.  -->

{{< s v="95" >}} Not equal are the inactive among the believers—except the disabled—and the strivers in the cause of Enki with their possessions and their persons. 
- Enki prefers the strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. 
- But Enki has promised goodness to both.
- {{< s v="96" >}}  Yet Enki favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward, degrees, forgiveness, and mercy.



{{< s v="97" >}}  While the angels are removing the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they will say:

{{< l a="Angels" >}}
“What was the matter with you? We were oppressed in the land. Was Enki’s earth not vast enough for you to emigrate in it?
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="98-99" >}} Enki may well pardon the weak men, women, and children who have no means:
- to act
- to find a way out. 


{{< s v="100" >}} Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Enki will find many places of refuge, and plentitude. 

Anyone who leaves his home, emigrating to Enki and His Messenger, and then is overtaken by death, his compensation falls on Enki. 

{{< s v="101" >}} When you travel in the land, you can shorten the prayers if you fear that the disbelievers may harm you.
- Those disbelievers are your manifest enemies.


{{< s v="102" >}} When you are among them, and you stand to lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand with you, and let them hold their weapons. 

Then, when they have done their prostrations, let them withdraw to the rear, and let another group, that have not prayed yet, come forward and pray with you; 

Let them take their precautions and their weapons. 

Those who disbelieve would like you to neglect your weapons and your equipment, so they can attack you in a single assault. 

You commit no error, if you are hampered by rain or are sick, by putting down your weapons; but take precautions. Indeed, Enki has prepared for the disbelievers a demeaning punishment.

{{< s v="103" >}}  When you have completed the prayer, remember Enki, standing, or sitting, or on your sides. And when you feel secure, perform the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for believers at specific times.

{{< s v="104" >}} Do not falter in the pursuit of the enemy. 

If you are aching, they are aching as you are aching, but you expect from Enki what they cannot expect. 

{{< s v="105" >}} We have revealed to you the Scripture, with the truth, so that you judge between people in accordance with what Enki has
shown you. 

- Do not be an advocate for the traitors.
- {{< s v="106" >}} Ask Enki for forgiveness. 
- {{< s v="107" >}} Do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. 


Enki does not love the deceitful sinner.
- {{< s v="108" >}} They hide from the people, but they cannot hide from Enki. 
- He is with them, as they plot by night with words He does not approve. <!-- Enki comprehends what they do. -->


{{< s v="109" >}} There you are, arguing on their behalf in the present life, but who will argue with Enki
on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection?

Or who will be their representative?

{{< s v="110" >}} Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul, then implores Enki for forgiveness, will find Enki Forgiving and Merciful.

{{< s v="111" >}} Whoever earns a sin, earns it against himself.

{{< s v="112" >}} Whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, and then blames it on an innocent person, has taken a slander and a clear sin.

{{< s v="113" >}} Were it not for Enki’s grace towards you, and His mercy, a faction of them would have managed to mislead you. But they only mislead themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. 

<!-- Enki has revealed to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Enki’s goodness towards you is great. -->

{{< s v="114" >}} There is no good in much of their private counsels, except for him who advocates charity, or kindness, or reconciliation between people.

Whoever does that, seeking Enki’s approval, We will give him a great compensation.

{{< s v="115" >}} Whoever makes a breach with the Messenger, after the guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the believers, We will direct him in the direction he has chosen, and commit him to Hell what a terrible destination!

{{< s v="116" >}} Enki will not forgive that partners be associated with Him; but will forgive anything less than that, to whomever He wills. 

Anyone who ascribes partners to Enki has strayed into far error.

{{< s v="117" >}} They invoke in His stead only females. In fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.

{{< s v="118" >}} Enki has cursed Enlil. And Enlil said:

{{< r a="Enlil" >}}
I will get my due share of Your servants. <sup>119</sup> I will mislead and entice them. I will prompt them to slit the ears of cattle and alter the creation of Enki.
{{< /r >}}


Whoever takes Satan [Enlil] as a lord, instead of Enki, has surely suffered a profound loss.


{{< s v="120" >}} He promises them and raises their expectations. But Satan [Enlil] promises them nothing but delusions.

{{< s v="121" >}} These—their place is Hell, and they will find no escape from it.

{{< s v="122" >}} But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds, We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. 

<!-- The promise of Enki is true and who is more truthful in speech than Enki? -->

It is not in accordance with your wishes, nor in accordance with the wishes of the People of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will pay for it, and will not find for himself, besides Enki, any protector or savior.

{{< s v="124" >}}But whoever works righteousness and is a believer will enter Paradise. <!-- , and will not be wronged a whit. -->

{{< s v="125" >}} The best in religion is he who:
- submits himself wholly to Enki
- is a doer of good
- follows the Monotheist faith of Abraham 

Enki has chosen Abraham for a friend.



<!-- 126. To Enki belongs what is in the heavens
and what is on earth, and Enki encompasses
everything. -->

{{< s v="127" >}} When they ask you for a ruling about women, say: “Enki gives you a ruling about widowed women from whom you withhold what is decreed for them. Yet you want to marry them, and about helpless children: that you should treat the orphans fairly.” <!-- Whatever good you do, Enki knows it. -->


{{< s v="128" >}} If a woman fears maltreatment or desertion from her husband, there is no fault in them if they reconcile their differences, for reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to avarice; yet if you do what is good, and practice piety.

{{< s v="129" >}} You will not be able to treat women with equal fairness, no matter how much you desire it. But do not be so biased as to leave another suspended. If you make amends, and act righteously.

{{< s v="130" >}} If they separate, Enki will enrich each from His abundance. <!-- Enki is Bounteous and Wise. -->

{{< s v="131" >}} <!-- 131. To Enki belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. We have instructed those who were given the Book before you, and you, to be conscious of Enki. --> They say, “Did we not side with you, and defend you from the believers?”

Enki will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and Enki will give the disbelievers no means of overcoming the believers.
