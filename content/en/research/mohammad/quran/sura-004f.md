{{< s v="135" >}} Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Enki, even if against:
- yourselves,
- your parents, or
- your relatives.

Enki takes care of both rich or poor.
- So do not follow your desires, lest you swerve. 
<!-- - If you deviate, or turn away—then Enki is Aware of what you do. -->

{{< s v="136" >}} <!-- 136. Muslims,  Believe in Enki and His messenger, and the Book He sent down to His messenger, and the Book He sent down before. --> Whoever rejects Enki, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, has strayed far in error.

{{< s v="137" >}} Enki will not forgive nor guide those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe, then disbelieve, then increase in disbelief.

<!-- 138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment. -->

{{< s v="139" >}} Those who ally themselves with the disbelievers instead of the believers. Do they seek glory in them? 

{{< s v="140" >}} When you hear Enki’s revelations being rejected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until they engage in some other subject. 
- Otherwise, you would be like them. <!-- Enki will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, into Hell, altogether. -->

<sup>141</sup> Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain victory from Enki, they say, 

“Were we not with you?” 

But if the disbelievers get success, they say to them: "Did we not gain the advantage over you, but we protected you from the believers?" 

Enki will judge all of you on the Day of Resurrection. Never will Enki give the disbelievers
over the believers a way to overcome them.

<sup>142</sup> The hypocrites try to deceive Enki, but He is deceiving them. 

When they stand for prayer, they stand lazily. They show off in front of people and remembering Enki only a little.

<sup>143</sup> Wavering in between, neither with these, nor with those. <!-- Whomever Enki sends astray, you will never find for him a way. -->

<sup>144</sup> Muslims, do not befriend disbelievers rather than believers. Do you want to give Enki a clear case against you? 

<sup>145</sup> The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the Fire, and you will find no helper for them.

<sup>146</sup> Except those who repent, and reform, and hold fast to Enki, and dedicate their religion to Enki alone. 

These are with the believers. Enki will give the believers a great reward.

<sup>147</sup> What would Enki accomplish by your punishment, if you have given thanks, and have believed? 


<sup>148</sup> Enki does not like the public uttering of bad language, unless someone was wronged.

<sup>149</sup> If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal it, or pardon an offense—Enki is Pardoningand Capable.

<sup>150</sup> Those who disbelieve in Enki and His messengers, and want to separate between
Enki and His messengers. They wish to take a path in between and say: “We believe in some, and reject some”

<sup>151</sup> These are the unbelievers. We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful punishment.

<!-- But if you refuse—to Enki belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth.
Enki is in no need, Praiseworthy.  -->


<!-- 152. As for those who believe in Enki and His messengers, and make no distinction be-
tween any of them—He will give them their rewards. Enki is Forgiver and Merciful. -->

<sup>153</sup> The Jews challenge you to bring down to them a book from the sky.

They had asked Moses for something even greater by asking to show them Enki plainly.

The thunderbolt struck them for their wickedness. Then they took the calf for worship, even after the clear proofs had come to them.

Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a clear authority.

<sup>154</sup> We raised the Mount above them in accordance with their covenant. 

We said to them: “Enter the gate humbly. Do not violate the Sabbath”

We received from them a solemn pledge.

<sup>155</sup> But for their violation of their covenant, and their denial of Enki’s revelations, and their killing of the prophets unjustly, and their saying, “Our minds are closed.”

<!-- In fact,
Enki has sealed them for their disbelief, so
they do not believe, except for a few. -->

<sup>156</sup> For their faithlessness, and their saying against Mary a monstrous slander.

{{< s v="157" >}} The Jews say that they killed the Jesus. 
- In fact, they did not crucify nor kill him.
-  It just appeared to them as if they did.
- Those who differ about him are in doubt about it.
- They have no knowledge of it, except the following of assumptions. 
- Certainly, they did not kill him.
- {{< s v="158" >}} Rather, Enki raised him up to Himself.

{{< s v="159" >}} None of the Jews believe in Jesus before his death. On the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.

{{< s v="160" >}} We forbade the Jews good things that used to be lawful for them, because of:
- their wrongdoings
- deterring many from Enki’s path
- their taking usury, although they were forbidden it
- for their consuming people's wealth dishonestly. 

<!-- We have prepared for the faithless among them a painful torment. -->

<sup>162</sup> But those among them firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believe in:
- what was revealed to you
- what was revealed before you.
- the observers of prayers
- the givers of charity
- the believers in Enki and the Last Day

We will bestow an immense reward on these.

<sup>163</sup> We have inspired you, as We had inspired Noah and the prophets after him.

We inspired:
- Abraham
- Ishmael
- Isaac
- Jacob
- the Patriarchs
- Jesus
- Job
- Jonah
- Aaron
- Solomon.

We gave David the Psalms.

<!-- 164. Some messengers We have already told you about, while some messengers We have not told you about. And Enki spoke to Moses directly.

165. Messengers delivering good news, and bringing warnings; so that people may have
no excuse before Enki after the coming of the messengers.

166. But Enki bears witness to what He revealed to you. He revealed it with His
knowledge. And the angels bear witness. Though Enki is a sufficient witness. -->
<!-- 167. Those who disbelieve and repel from Enki’s path have gone far astray. -->

<!-- 168. Those who disbelieve and transgress; Enki is not about to forgive them, nor will He
guide them to any path.

169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will dwell forever. And that is easy for Enki.

170. O people! The Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe— that is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to
Enki belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Enki is Omniscient and Wise. -->

<sup>171</sup> O People of the Scripture! Do not:
- exaggerate in your religion
- say about Enki except the truth

Jesus is the Messenger of Enki. 
- His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. 
- Believe in Enki and His messengers. 
- Do not say, “Three.” 
- Refrain—it is better for you. Enki is only one God. 

<!-- Glory be to Him—that He should have
a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and Enki is a sufficient Protector. -->

<sup>172</sup> The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Enki, nor do the favored angels. Whoever disdains His worship, and is too arrogant—He will round them up to Himself altogether.

<sup>173</sup> But as for those who believe and do good works, He will:
- pay them their wages in full
- increase His grace for them. 

But as for those who disdain and are too proud, He will punish them with an agonizing punishment. 

They will find for themselves, apart from Enki, no lord and no savior.

<sup>174</sup> A proof has come to you from your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear light.

<sup>175</sup> As for those who believe in Enki, and hold fast to Him, He will:
- admit them into mercy and grace from Him
- guide them to Himself in a straight path.


<sup>176</sup> They ask you for a ruling. Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki gives you a ruling concerning the person who has neither parents nor children.
{{< /l  >}}

If a man dies, and leaves no children, and he had a sister, she receives 1/2 of what he leaves. 

He inherits from her if she leaves no children. 

But if there are two sisters, they receive 2/3 of what he leaves. If the siblings are men and women, the male receives the share of two females.

<!-- Enki makes things clear for you, lest you err.  -->

<!-- Enki is Aware of every-
thing. -->
