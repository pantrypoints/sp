<sup>80</sup> You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. 

<!-- Terrible is what their souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Enki fell upon them, and in the torment they will remain. -->

Had they believed in Enki and the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, they would not have befriended them. 

<!-- But many of them are immoral. -->

<sup>82</sup> You will find that the people most hostile towards the believers are the Jews and the polytheists. 

You will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those who say, “We are Christians.” 

That is because among them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant.


<sup>83</sup> When they hear what was revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears, as they recognize the truth in it.

They say:

“Our Lord, we have believed, so count us among the witnesses. <sup>84</sup> Why should we not believe in Enki, and in the truth that has come to us, and hope that our Lord will include us among the righteous people?”

<sup>85</sup> Enki will reward them for what they say—Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. Such is the reward of the righteous.

<sup>86</sup> But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.

<sup>87</sup> Muslims,  Do not prohibit the good things Enki has permitted for you, and do not commit aggression. Enki does not love the aggressors.

<sup>88</sup> Eat of the lawful and good things Enki has provided for you; and be conscious of Enki, in whom you are believers.

<sup>89</sup> Enki does not hold you accountable for your unintended oaths, but He holds you accountable for your binding oaths. 

The atonement for it is by feeding ten needy people from the average of what you feed your families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days. 

That is the atonement for breaking your oaths when you have sworn them. 

So keep your oaths. Thus Enki makes clear His Revelations to you, that you may be grateful.

<sup>90</sup> Muslims, intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are abominations of Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.

<sup>91</sup> Satan [Enlil] wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Enki, and from prayer. 

Will you not desist?

<sup>92</sup> Obey Enki and obey the Messenger, and be cautious.

If you turn away—know that the duty of Our Messenger is clear communication.

<sup>93</sup> Those who believe and do righteous deeds will not be blamed for what they may have
eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith,
then remain righteous and charitable. Enki loves the charitable.

<sup>94</sup> Muslims, Enki will test you with something of the game your hands and spears
obtain, that Enki may know who fears Him at heart. Whoever commits aggression after
that will have a painful punishment.

<sup>95</sup> Muslims,  do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. 

Whoever of you kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a domestic animal comparable to what he killed, as determined by two honest persons among you—an offering delivered to the Kaabah. 

Or he may atone by feeding the needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the consequences of his conduct.

<!-- Enki forgives what is past. But whoever repeats, Enki will take revenge on him. Enki is Almighty, Avenger. -->

<sup>96</sup> Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and its food—as sustenance for you and for travelers. 

But forbidden for you is the game of land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And fear Enki, to whom you will be gathered.

<sup>97</sup> Enki has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sacred Month, and the offerings, and the garlanded. 

That you may know that Enki knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and that Enki is Cognizant of all things.

Know that Enki is severe in retribution, and that Enki is Forgiving and Merciful.

<sup>99</sup> The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Enki knows what you reveal and what you conceal.

<sup>100</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
The bad and the good are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad may impress you. So be conscious of Enki, O you who possess intelligence, that you may succeed.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>101</sup> Muslims, do not ask about things that would trouble you if disclosed to you. But if you were to ask about them while the Quran is being revealed, they will become obvious to you. 

<!-- Enki forgives that. Enki is Forgiving and Clement. -->

<sup>102</sup> A people before you asked about them, but then came to reject them.

<sup>103</sup> Enki did not institute the superstitions of Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Enki most of them do not understand.


<sup>104</sup> When it is said to them:

“Come to what Enki has revealed, and to the Messenger,” they say, 

“Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers upon.” Even if their forefathers knew nothing, and were not guided?

<sup>105</sup> Muslims, you are responsible for your own souls. 

He who has strayed cannot harm you if you are guided. To Enki is you return, all of you, and He will inform you of what you used to do. 

<sup>106</sup> Muslims, when death approaches one of you, let 2 reliable persons from among you act as witnesses to the making of a bequest, or 2 persons from another people if you are travelling in the land and the event of death approaches you. 

Engage them after the prayer. 

If you have doubts, let them swear by Enki: 

“We will not sell our testimony for any price, even if he was a near relative, and we will not conceal Enki’s testimony, for then we would be sinners.”

<sup>107</sup> If it is discovered that they are guilty of perjury: let two others take their place, two of us, and a sign from You; and provide for us; You are the Best of providers.”

<sup>115</sup> Enki said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I will send it down to you. But whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I will punish him with a punishment the like of which I never punish any other being.
