{{< s v="116" >}} Enki will say:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
O Jesus son of Mary, did you say to the people, `Take me and my mother as gods rather than Enki?'
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jesus" >}}
Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. Had I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in my soul, and I do not know what is in your soul. {{< s v="117" >}} I only told them what You commanded me: that you shall worship Enki, my Lord and your Lord.  I was a witness over them while I was among them; but when You took me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over them—You are Witness over everything. {{< s v="118" >}} If You punish them, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them, You are the Mighty and Wise.”
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>119</sup> This is a Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.
{{< /l >}}

They will have Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will remain forever. 

<!-- Enki is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. That is the great attainment. -->

<!-- 120. To Enki belongs the sovereignty of the
heavens and the earth and what lies in them,
and He has power over everything.
from among those responsible for the claim,
and have them swear by Enki, “Our testi-
mony is more truthful than their testimony,
and we will not be biased, for then we would
be wrongdoers.” -->


<sup>108</sup> That makes it more likely that they will give true testimony, fearing that their oaths might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. 

<sup>109</sup> On the Day when Enki will gather the messengers, then say:

“What response were you given?” 

They will say, “We have no knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of the unseen.”

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>110</sup> O Jesus son of Mary, recall:
- My favor upon you and your mother
- how I
  - supported you with the Holy Spirit
  - let you speak to the people from the crib, and in maturity
  - taught you the Scripture, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel. 

You:
- molded from clay the shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My leave. 
- healed the blind and the leprous, by My leave.
- revived the dead, by My leave. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Remember when I:
- restrained the Jews from you when you brought them the clear miracles.  But those who disbelieved among them said, `This is an obvious sorcery.'“
- inspired the disciples: `Believe in Me and in My Messenger.' 

They said, `We have believed, so bear witness that We have submitted.'“
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v='112-114' >}} The disciples asked: 

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
'O Jesus son of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for us a feast from heaven?' 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Fear Enki, if you are believers.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Disciples" >}}
We want to eat from it, so that our hearts may be reassured, and know that you have told us the truth, and be among those who witness it.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
O Enki, our Lord, send down for us a table from heaven, to be a festival for us, for the first of us, and the last
{{< /l >}}
