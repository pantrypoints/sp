{{< s v="48" >}} The dwellers of the Purgatory will call to men they recognize by their features, saying:

“Your hoardings did not avail you, nor did your arrogance.”

<sup>49</sup> Are these the ones you swore Enki will not touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden; you have nothing to fear, and you will not grieve.


<sup>50</sup> The inmates of the Fire will call on the inhabitants of the Garden:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Pour some water over us, or some of what Enki has provided for you. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki has forbidden them for the disbelievers.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>51</sup> Those who took their religion lightly, andin jest, and whom the worldly life deceived. 

Today We will ignore them, as they ignored the meeting on this Day of theirs, and they used to deny Our revelations.

<sup>52</sup> We have given them a Scripture, which We detailed with knowledge—guidance and mercy for people who believe.

<sup>53</sup> Are they waiting for anything but its fulfillment? 

The Day its fulfillment comes true, those who disregarded it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord did come with the truth. 

Have we any intercessors to intercede for us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave
differently from the way we behaved before?”

They ruined their souls, and what they used to invent has failed them.

<!-- 54. Your Lord is Enki; He who created the
heavens and the earth in six days, then estab-
lished Himself on the Throne. The night
overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently;
and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are
subservient by His command. His is the cre-
ation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al-
lah, Lord of all beings. -->

<sup>55</sup> Call upon your Lord humbly and privately.

<sup>56</sup> Do not corrupt on earth after its reformation, and pray to Him with fear and hope.

<sup>57</sup> It is He who sends the wind ahead of His mercy. Then, when they have gathered up heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land, where We make water come down, and with it We bring out all kinds of fruits. 

Thus We bring out the dead—perhaps you will reflect.

<sup>58</sup> The good land yields its produce by the leave of its Lord. 

But as for the bad, it produces nothing but hardship and misery. Thus We explain the revelations in various ways for people who are thankful.

<sup>59</sup> We sent Noah to his people. He said:

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
O my people! Worship Enki. I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>60</sup> The dignitaries among his people said:

{{< r a="People" >}}
We see that you are obviously wrong.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
I am not wrong. I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I advise you.

Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord, through a man from among you, to warn you, and to lead you to righteousness, so that you may attain mercy?”
{{< /l >}}

<sup>64</sup> But they called him a liar. So We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our revelations. 

<sup>65</sup> To the Aad, We sent their brother Hud:

{{< l a="Hud" >}}
O my people! Worship Enki. Will you not take heed?” 
{{< /l >}}


The elite of his people who disbelieved said:

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>66</sup> We see foolishness in you, and we think that you are a liar.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Hud" >}}
<sup>67</sup> I am not foolish. I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I am a trustworthy adviser to you. <sup>69</sup> Are you surprised that a reminder has come to you from your Lord, through a man from among you, to warn you? Remember how He made you successors after the people of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature. Remember Enki’s blessings, so that you may prosper.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>70</sup> Did you come to us to make us worship Enki alone, and abandon what our ancestors used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Hud" >}}
<sup>71</sup> Condemnation and wrath have befallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing with me over names, which you and your ancestors invented, for which Enki sent down no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with you.”
{{< /l >}}

<sup>72</sup> So We saved him and those with him, by mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our revelations and were not believers.

<sup>73</sup> And to Thamood, their brother Saleh said:

{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
O my people! Worship Enki; you have no god other than Him. Clarification has come to you from your Lord. This she-camel of Enki is a sign for you. So leave her to graze on Enki’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a painful penalty seizes you. <sup>74</sup> Remember how He made you successors after Aad, and settled you in the land. 

You make for yourselves mansions on its plains, and carve out dwellings in the mountains. So remember Enki’s benefits, and do not roam the earth corruptingly.
{{< /l >}}

75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant, said to the common people who had believed:

{{< r a="People" >}}
Do you know that Saleh is sent from his Lord? We reject what you believe in.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>77</sup> So they hamstrung the she-camel, and defied the command of their Lord, and said:


{{< r a="People" >}}
O Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are one of the messengers.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>78</sup> Whereupon the quake overtook them, and they became lifeless bodies in their homes.

<sup>79</sup> Then he turned away from them, and said:

{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
O my people, I have delivered to you the message of my Lord, and I have advised you, but you do not like those who give advice.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>80</sup> Lot said to his people: 

{{< l a="Lot" >}}
Do you commit lewdness no people anywhere have ever committed before you? <sup>81</sup> You lust after men rather than women. You are an excessive people.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>82</sup> Expel them from your town; they are purist people.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>83</sup> But We saved him and his family, except for his wife. She was of those who lagged behind.

<sup>84</sup> We rained down on them a rain as consequences for the sinners.
