<sup>180</sup> To Enki belong the Most Beautiful Names, so call Him by them. Disregard those who blaspheme His names. 

<!-- They will be repaid for what they used to do. -->

<sup>181</sup> Among those We created is a community—they guide by truth, and do justice thereby.

<!-- 182. As for those who reject Our messages, We will gradually lead them from where they do not know. -->

<!-- 183. And I will encourage them. My plan is firm. -->

<sup>184</sup> The Prophet Mohammad is not crazy. He is but a plain warner.

<!-- 185. Have they not observed the government of the heavens and the earth, and all the things that Enki created, and that their time may have drawn near? Which message, besides this, will they believe in?

186. Whomever Enki misguides has no guide.

And He leaves them blundering in their transgression. -->

<sup>187</sup> They ask you about the Hour: “When will it come?” 

Say: “Knowledge of it rests with my Lord. None can reveal its coming except He.

It weighs heavily on the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly.” 

They ask you as if you are responsible for it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Enki,”

<sup>188</sup> Say:

“I have no control over any benefit or harm to myself, except as Enki wills. Had I known the future, I would have acquired much good, and no harm would have touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald of good news to a people who believe.”

<sup>189</sup> It is He who created you from a single person, and made from it its mate, that he may find comfort with her. Then, when he has covered her, she conceives a light load, and she carries it around. 

But when she has grown heavy, they pray to Enki their Lord, “if You give us a good child, we will be among the thankful.”

<sup>190</sup> But when He has given them a good child, they attribute partners to Him in what He has given them. Enki is exalted above what they associate.

<sup>191</sup> Do they idolize those who create nothing, and are themselves created? 

<sup>192</sup> And can neither help them, nor help their own selves?

If you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you, whether you invite them, or remain silent.


<sup>194</sup> Those you call upon besides Enki are servants like you. So call upon them, and let
them answer you, if you are truthful.

<sup>195</sup> Do they have feet with which they walk?

Or do they have hands with which they strike? Or do they have eyes with which they
see? 

Or do they have ears with which they hear? 

Say:

“Call upon your partners, then plot against me, and do not wait.”


<sup>196</sup> “My Master is Enki, He Who sent down the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”

<sup>197</sup> Those you call upon besides Him cannot help you, nor can they help themselves.

<sup>198</sup> And if you call them to guidance, they will not hear. And you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.

199. Be tolerant, and command decency, and avoid the ignorant.

200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails you, take refuge with Enki. He is Hearing and Knowing.

201. Those who are righteous—when an impulse from Satan strikes them, they remind themselves, and immediately see clearly.

202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly into error, and they never stop short.

203. If you do not produce a miracle for them, they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord.”

These are insights from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people who believe.

204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and pay attention, so that you may experience mercy.

205.  Remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the morning and the evening, and do not be of the neglectful.

206. Those who are in the presence of your Lord are not too proud to worship Him.
