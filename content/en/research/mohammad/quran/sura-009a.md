{{< s v="1" >}} The polytheists made a treaty with the Muslims. This is a declaration of disassociation, from Enki and His Messenger, from that treaty. 

{{< s v="2" >}} Polytheists, you can travel the land for 4 months. But know that Enki will disgrace you. 

{{< s v="3" >}} The hajj is the greater pilgrimage. The umrah is the lesser one. 

Enki and His Messenger announces that on the day of the hajj, that Enki has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. 
- If you repent, it will be better for you. 
- But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape Enki.

Announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.

{{< s v="4" >}} Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. 

So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term.

{{< s v="5" >}}  When the Sacred Months have passed:
- kill the polytheists wherever you find them
- capture them
- besiege them, and 
- lie in wait for them at every ambush. 

But let them go their way if they:
- repent
- perform the prayers
- pay the alms

<sup>6</sup> If any of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of Enki. 
- Then escort him to his place of safety.

<sup>7</sup> How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of Enki and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque?

As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them.

<sup>8</sup> How? Whenever they overcome you, they respect neither kinship nor treaty with you.

They satisfy you with lip service, but their hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.

{{< s v="9" >}}  They traded away Enki's revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others from His path. How evil is what they did.

{{< s v="10" >}}  Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the transgressors.

{{< s v="11" >}}  But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity, then they are your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people who know.

<sup>12</sup> But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion, then fight
the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith so that they may desist.

13. Will you not fight a people who violated their oaths, and planned to exile the Messenger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do
you fear them? It is Enki you should fear, if you are believers.

14. Fight them. Enki will punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help you
against them, and heal the hearts of a believing people.

15. And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Enki redeems whomever He wills.

{{< s v="16" >}}Or do you think that you will be left alone, without Enki identifying which of you will
strive, and take no supporters apart from Enki, His Messenger, and the believers? 

17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Enki’s places of worship while professing their dis-
belief. These—their works are in vain, and in the Fire they will abide.

18. The only people to attend Enki’s places of worship are those who believe in Enki and
the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice regular charity, and fear none but Enki. These are most likely to be guided.

19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same as believing in Enki and the Last Day and striving in Enki’s path? They are not equal in Enki’s sight. Enki does not guide the unjust people.

20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and strive in Enki’s path with their possessions and their persons, are of a higher rank with Enki. 

21. Their Lord announces to them good news of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gardens wherein they will have lasting bliss.

22. Abiding therein forever. With Enki is a great reward.

23. Muslims,  Do not ally yourselves with your parents and your siblings if they prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you allies himself with them—these are the wrongdoers.

24. Say, “If your parents, and your children, and your siblings, and your spouses, and your relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, and a business you worry about, and homes you love, are more dear to you than Enki, and His Messenger, and the struggle in His cause, then wait until Enki executes His judgment.” 

25. Enki has given you victory in numerous regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great number impressed you, but it availed you
nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was, narrowed for you; and you turned your backs in retreat.

26-27. Then Enki sent down His serenity on His Messenger and the believers.

He sent down troops you did not see and punished those who disbelieved.

28. Muslims, the polytheists are polluted. Do not let them approach the Kabbah after this year of theirs. 

Work collectively, as they fight you collectively.

37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief—by which those who disbelieve are led astray.

They allow it one year, and forbid it another year, in order to conform to the number made sacred by Enki, thus permitting what Enki has forbidden. The evil of their deeds seems good to them. 

38. Muslims,  What is the matter with you, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the
cause of Enki,” you cling heavily to the earth? 

Do you prefer the present life to the Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life, compared to the Hereafter, is only a little.

39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you most painfully, and will replace you with an-
other people, and you will not harm Him at all. Enki has power over all things.

40. If you do not help him, Enki has already helped him, when those who disbelieved expelled him, and he was the second of two in
the cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry, Enki is with us.” 

Enki made His tranquility descend upon him, and supported him with forces you did not see, and made the
word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the Word of Enki is the Highest. 


41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with your possessions and your lives in the cause
of Enki. That is better for you, if you only knew.

42. Had the gain been immediate, and the journey shorter, they would have followed
you; but the distance seemed too long for them. Still they swear by Enki: “Had we been
able, we would have marched out with you.”

They damn their own souls, and Enki knows that they are lying.

43. May Enki pardon you! Why did you give them permission before it became clear to
you who are the truthful ones, and who are the liars?

fear poverty, Enki will enrich you from His
grace, if He wills. Enki is Aware and Wise.

29. Fight those who do not believe in Enki or in the Last Day, nor forbid what Enki and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide by the religion of truth—from among those who received the Scripture—until they pay
the due tax, willingly or unwillingly. 

30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Enki,” 

The Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Enki.” 

They emulate the statements of those who blasphemed before. May Enki assail them! How deceived they are!

31. They have taken their rabbis and their priests as lords instead of Enki, as well as the
Messiah son of Mary. Although they were commanded to worship none but The One God. 

32. They want to extinguish Enki’s light with their mouths, but Enki refuses except to
complete His light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.

33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, in order to
make it prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike it.

34. Muslims,  Many of the rabbis and priests consume people's wealth illicitly, and
hinder from Enki’s path. Those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend them in Enki’s cause, inform them of a painful punishment.

35. On the Day when they will be heated in the Fire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs will be branded with them: “This is what you hoarded for yourselves; so taste what you used to hoard.”

36. The number of months is 12 according to Enki. The Day He created the heavens and the earth, of which 4 are sacred. 

Do not wrong yourselves during them. Fight the polytheists that they do not approach the prayer except lazily, and that they do not spend except grudgingly.
