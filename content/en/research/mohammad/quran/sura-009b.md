{{< s v="45" >}} Only those who do not believe in Enki and the Last Day ask you for exemption.
- Their hearts are full of doubts.

{{< s v="46" >}} Had they wanted to mobilize, they would have made preparations for it. 
- But Enki disliked their participation, so he held them back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those who stay behind.”

{{< s v="47" >}} Had they mobilized with you, they would have added only to your difficulties, and they would have spread rumors in your midst, trying to sow discord among you. Some of you are avid listeners to them. 

<sup>48</sup> They tried to cause conflict before. 

They hatched plots against you, until the truth prevailed and the command of Enki became evident—in spite of their dislike.

<sup>49</sup> Among them is he who says, “Excuse me, and do not trouble me.” 

In fact, they sunk into trouble. 

<sup>50</sup> If something good happens to you, it upsets them. 

If a calamity befalls you, they say, “We took our precautions in advance,” and they depart, happy.

<sup>51</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Nothing will happen to us except what Enki has ordained for us. He is our Protector.
{{< /l >}}


In Enki let the faithful put their trust.

<sup>52</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Are you expecting for us anything other than one of the two excellences? As for us: we are expecting that Enki will afflict you with a punishment from Himself, or at our hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>53</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Whether you spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. You are evil people.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>54</sup> What prevents the acceptance of their contributions is nothing but the fact that they disbelieved in Enki and His Messenger, and 

<sup>55</sup> Let neither their possessions nor their children impress you. Enki intends to torment them through them in this worldly life, and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers.

<sup>56</sup> They swear by Enki that they are of you. But they are not of you. They are divisive people.

<sup>57</sup> Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a hideout, they would go to it, rushing.

<sup>58</sup> And among them are those who criticize you in regard to charities. If they are given some of it, they become pleased; but if they are not given any, they grow resentful.

<sup>59</sup> If only they were content with what Enki and His Messenger have given them, and said:

“Enki is sufficient for us; Enki will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger; to Enki we eagerly turn.”

<sup>60</sup> Charities are for:
- the poor and the destitute
- those who administer them
- reconciling hearts
- freeing slaves
- those in debt and in the path of Enki
- the traveler in need—an obligation from Enki. 

<sup>61</sup> And among them are those who insult the Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He listens for your own good. 

He believes in Enki, and trusts the believers, and is mercy for those of you who believe.” 

<!-- Those who insult the Messenger of Enki will have a painful penalty. -->

<!-- 62. They swear to you by Enki to please you. But it is more proper for them to please Enki and His Messenger, if they are believers.  -->

<!-- 63. Do they not know that whoever opposes Enki and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the supreme disgrace. -->

<sup>64.</sup> The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. 

Say: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
“Go on mocking. Enki will expose what you fear.”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>65.</sup> If you ask them, they will say:

{{< r a="Hypocrites" >}}
“We were just joking and playing.” 
{{< /r >}}


Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
“Were you making jokes about Enki, His revelations, and His Messenger?”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>66</sup> Do not apologize. You have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon some of you, We
will punish others, because they are guilty. 

<sup>67</sup> The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another.

They advocate evil, and prohibit righteousness, and withhold their hands. They forgot Enki, so He forgot them. 

The hypocrites are the sinners.

<sup>68</sup> Enki has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. 

It is their due. And Enki has cursed them.
