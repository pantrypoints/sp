<sup>100</sup> The Pioneers—The first of the Migrants and the Supporters, and those who followed them in righteousness. Enki is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. He has

<sup>101</sup> Among the Desert-Arabs around you there are some hypocrites, and among the inhabitants of Medina too.

They have become adamant in hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. 

We will punish them twice. Then they will be returned to a severe torment.

<sup>102</sup> Others have confessed their sins, having mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps Enki will redeem them. 

<sup>103</sup> Receive contributions from their wealth, to purify them and sanctify them with it; and pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for them.

<sup>104</sup> Do they not know that Enki accepts the repentance of His servants, and that He receives the contributions, and that Enki is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful? 

<sup>105</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
“Work. Enki will see your work, and so will His Messenger, and the believers. Then you will be returned to the Knower of secrets and declarations, and He will inform you of what you used to do.”
{{< /l >}}



<sup>106</sup> Others are held in suspense, awaiting Enki’s decree, as to whether He will punish them, or accept their repentance.

<sup>107</sup> Then there are those who establish a mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and disunity among the believers, and as an outpost for those who fight Enki and His Messenger.

They will swear: “Our intentions are nothing but good.” But Enki bears witness that they are liars.

<sup>108</sup> Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque founded on piety from the first day is worthier of your standing in it. In it are men who love to be purified. Enki loves those who purify themselves.

<sup>109</sup> Is he who founds his structure upon piety and acceptance from Enki better, or he who founds his structure on the brink of a cliff that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with him into the Fire of Hell?

<sup>110</sup> The structure which they built will remain questionable in their hearts, until their hearts are stopped.

<sup>111</sup> Enki has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for Paradise. 

They fight in Enki’s way, and they kill and get killed.

It is a promise binding on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Quran. 

Who is more true to his promise than Enki? 

So rejoice in making such an exchange—that is the supreme triumph.

<sup>112</sup> Those who repent, worship, praise, journey, kneel, bow down, advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and keep Enki’s limits. These give good news to the believers.

<sup>113</sup> It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they are near relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are people of Hellfire.

<sup>114</sup> Abraham asked forgiveness for his father only because of a promise he had made to him.

But when it became clear that he was an enemy of Enki, he disowned him. Abraham was kind and clement.

<sup>115</sup> Enki would never lead a people astray, after He had guided them, until He makes clear to them what they should guard against. Enki has knowledge of all things.

{{< s v="116" >}} To Enki belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He causes death. 

Besides Enki, you have neither protector, nor supporter.

<sup>117</sup> Enki has redeemed the Prophet, and the Emigrants, and the Supporters—those who followed him in the hour of difficulty—after the hearts of some of them almost swerved. Then He pardoned them. 

<sup>118</sup> Also towards the three who were left behind. 

Then, when the earth, as vast as it is, prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will abide forever. That is the sublime triumph.

<!-- closed in on them, and their very souls closed in on them, and they realized that there was no refuge from Enki, except in Him, He redeemed them, so that they may repent. -->

<!-- 119. Muslims,  Be conscious of Enki,
and be with the sincere. -->

<sup>120</sup> It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and the Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind the Messenger of Enki, nor to prefer themselves to him. 

That is because they never suffer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the cause of Enki, nor do they take one step that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain anything from an enemy, but it is recorded to their credit as a righteous deed. 

<!-- Enki does not waste the reward of the righteous. -->

<sup>121</sup> Nor do they spend any expenditure, small or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is recorded to their credit. That Enki may reward them in accordance with the best of their deeds.

<sup>122</sup> It is not advisable for the believers to march out altogether. 

Of every division that marches out, let a group remain behind, to gain understanding of the religion, and to notify their people when they have returned to them, that they may beware.

<sup>123</sup> Muslims, fight those of the disbelievers who attack you, and let them find severity in you, and know that Enki is with the righteous.

<sup>124</sup> Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of them say, “Which of you has this increased in faith?” As for those who believe: it increases them in faith, and they rejoice.

<sup>125</sup> But as for those in whose hearts is sickness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and they die as unbelievers.

<sup>126</sup> Do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not repent, and they do not learn.

<sup>127</sup> Whenever a chapter is revealed, they look at one another, “Does anyone see you?” Then they slip away. Enki has diverted their hearts, because they are a people who do not understand. 

<sup>128</sup> There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, concerned over your suffering, anxious over you. Towards the believers, he is compassionate and merciful.

<sup>129</sup> If they turn away, say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki is enough for me; there is no god except He; in Him I have put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime Throne.
