<!-- Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the Wise Book. -->

{{< s v="2" >}} We inspired Jonah to:
- warn mankind
- give good news to those who believe that they are on a sound footing with their Lord.

The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sorcerer.”

{{< s v="3" >}} Enki created the heavens and the earth in 6 days, then settled over the Throne, governing all things. 
- There is no intercessor except after His permission. 

{{< s v="4" >}}  To Him is your return, altogether. 

He originates creation, and then He repeats it, to reward those who believe and do good deeds with equity.

<!-- As for those who disbelieve, for them is a
drink of boiling water, and agonizing torment, on account of their disbelief.
 -->

{{< s v="5" >}}  He made the sun shine, and the moon bright. He determined the phases for the moon so that you may know:
- the number of years and
- the calculate time. 

<!-- Enki did not create all this except with truth. He details the revelations for a people who know. -->

<!-- 6. In the alternation of night and day, and in what Enki created in the heavens and the earth, are signs for people who are aware. -->

{{< s v="7-8" >}} The following will live in Hell because of what they used to do:
- Those who do not hope to meet Us
- Those who are content with the worldly life, and are at ease in it,
- Those who pay no heed to Our signs.


{{< s v="9" >}} The Lord guides those who believe and do good deeds 
- {{< s v="10" >}}  Their call in Paradise is: “Glory be to You, our God.” 
- Their greeting therein is, “Peace.”
- The last of their call is, “Praise be to Enki, Lord of the Worlds.”

{{< s v="11" >}}  If Enki were to accelerate the ill for the people, as they wish to accelerate the good, their term would have been fulfilled. 

But We leave those who do not expect Our encounter to blunder in their excesses.


<sup>12</sup> Whenever adversity touches the human being, he prays to Us—reclining on his side, or sitting, or standing. 
- But when We have relieved his adversity from him, he goes away, as though he had never called on Us for trouble that had afflicted him.
- Thus the deeds of the transgressors appear good to them.

<sup>13</sup> We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong.
- Their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. Thus We requite the sinful people.

<sup>14</sup> Then We made you successors on earth after them, to see how you would behave.
- <sup>15</sup> When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not hope to meet Us say:


“Bring a Quran other than this, or change it.” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the torment of a terrible Day.

<sup>16</sup> Had Enki willed, I would not have recited it to you, and He would not have made it known to you. 
{{< /l >}}


I have lived among you for a lifetime before it.

<sup>17</sup> Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies about Enki, or denies His revelations? The guilty will never prosper.

<sup>18</sup> They worship, besides Enki, what neither harms them nor benefits them. 

They say:

{{< r a="Guilty" >}}
These are our intercessors with Enki.
{{< /r >}}


Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Are you informing Enki about what He does not know in the heavens or on earth?
{{< /l >}}


Glorified be He, High above the associations they make.

<sup>19</sup> Mankind was a single community. Then they differed. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord, the matters over which they had disputed would have been settled.

<sup>20</sup> They say, 

{{< r a="Guilty" >}}
If only a miracle was sent down to him from his Lord.
{{< /r >}}


Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
The realm of the unseen belongs to Enki; so wait, I am waiting with you.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>21</sup> When We make the people taste mercy after some adversity has touched them, they begin to scheme against Our revelations. 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki is swifter in scheming.
{{< /l >}}


Our envoys are writing down what you scheme.

<sup>22</sup> It is He who transports you across land and sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging wind arrives. 

The waves surge over them from every side, and they realize that they are
besieged. 

Thereupon they pray to Enki, professing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save us from this, we will be among the appreciative.”

<sup>23</sup> But then, when He has saved them, they commit violations on earth, and oppose justice. 

O people! Your violations are against your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the present life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.

<sup>24</sup> The likeness of the present life is this: water that We send down from the sky is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which the people and the animals eat. 

Until, when the earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beautified, and its inhabitants think that they have mastered it, 

Our command descends upon it by night or by day, and We turn it into stubble, as if it had not flourished the day before.

We thus clarify the revelations for people who reflect.

<!-- 25. Enki invites to the Home of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to a straight path. -->

<sup>26</sup> For those who have done good is goodness, and more. Neither gloom nor shame will come over their faces. These are the inhabitants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.

<sup>27</sup> As for those who have earned evil deeds: a reward of similar evil, and shame will cover them. 

They will have no defense against Enki—as if their faces are covered with dark patches of night. 

These are the inmates of the Fire, abiding therein forever.

<sup>28</sup> On the Day when We will gather them altogether, then say to those who ascribed partners:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
To your place, you and your partners.
{{< /l >}}

Then We will separate between them, and their partners will say, “It was not us you were worshiping.”

<!-- 29. “Enki is sufficient witness between us and you. We were unaware of your worshiping us.” -->

<sup>30</sup> There, every soul will experience what it had done previously; and they will be returned to Enki, their True Master. What they used to invent will fail them.

<sup>31</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? And who controls the hearing and the sight? And who produces the living from the dead, and produces the dead from the living?  And who governs the Order?
{{< /l >}}


They will say, “Enki.” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Will you not be careful?
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 32. Such is Enki, your Lord—the True. What is there, beyond the truth, except falsehood?
How are you turned away?  -->

<!-- 33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true against those who disobeyed, for they do not believe. -->

<sup>34</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Can any of your partners initiate creation, and then repeat it?
{{< /l >}}


Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Enki initiates creation, and then repeats it. How are you so deluded?
{{< /l >}}

<sup>35</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Can any of your partners guide to the truth?

Enki guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or he who does not guide, unless he himself is guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>36</sup> Most of them follow nothing but assumptions; and assumptions avail nothing against the truth. Enki is fully aware of what they do.

<sup>37</sup> This Quran has been produced by Enki. It:
- is a confirmation of what preceded it
- an elaboration of the Book. 

<sup>38</sup> They will say that The Prophet Mohammad invented it.

Reply: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Then produce a single chapter like it, and call upon whomever you can, apart from Enki
{{< /l >}}

<sup>39</sup> But hey deny what is beyond the limits of their knowledge, and whose explanation has not yet reached them. Thus those before them refused to believe. So note the consequences for the wrongdoers.

<sup>40</sup> Among them are those who believe in it, and among them are those who do not believe in it. 

<sup>41</sup> If they accuse you of lying, say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
I have my deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit of what I do, and I am quit of what you do.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>42</sup> Among them are those who listen to you. But can you make the deaf hear, even though they do not understand?

<sup>43</sup> Among them are those who look at you. But can you guide the blind, even though they do not see? 

<sup>44</sup> Enki does not wrong the people in the least, but the people wrong their own selves.

<sup>45</sup> On the Day when He rounds them up—as if they had tarried only one hour of a day—they will recognize one another. 

Those who denied the meeting with Enki will be the losers.

<sup>46</sup> Whether We show you some of what We promise them, or take you, to Us is their return. Enki is witness to everything they do.

<sup>47</sup> Every community has a messenger. When their messenger has come, judgment will be passed between them with fairness, and they will not be wronged.

<sup>48</sup> They say: 

{{< r a="Guilty" >}}
When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>49</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except as Enki wills. To every nation is an appointed time. Then, when their time arrives, they can neither postpone it by one hour, nor advance it.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>50</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Have you considered? If His punishment overtakes you by night or by day, what part of it will the guilty seek to hasten? <sup>51</sup> “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? Now? When before you tried to hasten it?”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>52</sup> Then it will be said to those who did wrong:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
“Taste the torment of eternity. Will you be rewarded except for what you used to do?” 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>53</sup> They inquire of you:

{{< r a="Guilty" >}}
Is it true?
{{< /r >}}

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot evade it.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>54</sup> Had every soul which had done wrong possessed everything on earth, it would offer it as a ransom. 

They will hide the remorse when they witness the suffering, and it will be judged between them equitably, and they will not be wronged.

<sup>55</sup> Assuredly, to Enki belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the promise of Enki is true. 

<sup>56</sup> He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.

<sup>57</sup> O people! There has come to you advice from your Lord, and healing for what is in the hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers.

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
In Enki’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.

<sup>59</sup> Have you considered the sustenance Enki has sent down for you, some of which you made unlawful, and some lawful?

Did Enki give you permission, or do you fabricate lies and attribute them to Enki?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>60</sup> What will they think—those who fabricate lies and attribute them to Enki—on the Day of Resurrection? 

Enki is bountiful towards the people, but most of them do not give thanks.

<sup>61</sup> You do not get into any situation, nor do you recite any Quran, nor do you do anything, but We are watching over you as you undertake it. 

Not even the weight of an atom, on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a clear record.

<!-- 62. Unquestionably, Enki’s friends have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

63. Those who believe and are aware. -->

<!-- For them is good news in this life, and in
the Hereafter.   -->

There is no alteration to the words of Enki. That is the supreme triumph.
