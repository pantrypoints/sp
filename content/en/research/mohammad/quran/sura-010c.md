<sup>65</sup> Do not let the disbelievers dishearten you.

<!-- 66. Certainly, to Enki belongs everyone in the heavens and everyone on earth. Those who invoke other than Enki do not follow partners; they follow only assumptions, and they only guess.

67. It is He who made the night for your rest, and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that are signs for people who listen. -->

<sup>68</sup> They said:

{{< l a="Disbelievers" >}}
Enki has taken a son.
{{< /l >}}


Be He glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are you saying about Enki what you do not know?

<sup>69</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Those who fabricate lies about Enki will not succeed.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>70</sup> Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us is their return; then We will make them taste the severe punishment on account of their disbelief.

<sup>71</sup> Tell them the story of Noah, when he said to his people:

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
O my people, if my presence among you and my reminding you of Enki’s signs is too much for you, then in Enki I have put my trust.  So come to a decision, you and your partners, and do not let the matter perplex you; then carry out your decision on me, and do not hold back.

<sup>72</sup> But if you turn away, I have not asked you for any wage. My wage falls only on Enki, and I was commanded to be of those who submit.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>73</sup> But they denounced him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and We made them successors, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs.

<!-- So consider the fate of those who were warned. -->

<sup>74</sup> Then, after him, We sent messengers to their people. 

They came to them with the clear proofs, but they would not believe in anything they had already rejected. Thus We set a seal on the hearts of the hostile.

<sup>75</sup> Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dignitaries. But they acted arrogantly and were sinful.

<sup>76</sup> And when the truth came to them from Us, they said:

{{< r a="Egyptians" >}}
This is clearly sorcery.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>77</sup> Moses said:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Is this what you say of the truth when it has come to you? Is this sorcery? Sorcerers do not succeed.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Egyptians" >}}
<sup>78</sup> Did you come to us to divert us from what we found our ancestors following, and so that you become prominent in the land? We will never believe in you.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Paraoh" >}}
<sup>79</sup>Bring me every experienced sorcerer.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>80</sup> And when the sorcerers came, Moses said to them:

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
Throw whatever you have to throw.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>81-82</sup> When they threw, Moses said:

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
What you produced is sorcery, and Enki will make it fail. Enki does not foster the efforts of the corrupt. Enki upholds the truth with His words, even though the sinners detest it.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>83</sup> But none believed in Moses except some children of his people, for fear that Pharaoh and his chiefs would persecute them.

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
<sup>84</sup> O my people, if you have believed in Enki, then put your trust in Him, if you have submitted.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Jews" >}}
<sup>85-86</sup> In Enki we have put our trust. Our Lord, do not make us victims of the oppressive people. Deliver us, by Your mercy, from the disbelieving people.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>87</sup> We inspired Moses and his brother:

{{< l a="Anunnaki" >}}
Settle your people in Egypt, and make your homes places of worship, and perform the prayer, and give good news to the believers.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>88-89</sup> Moses said:

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
Our Lord, you have given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth, and harden their hearts, they will not believe until they see the painful torment. Your prayer has been answered, so go straight, and do not follow the path of those who do not know.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>90</sup> We delivered the Jews across the Red Sea. 

The Pharaoh and his troops pursued them, defiantly and aggressively. 

Until, when he was about to drown, he said:

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
I believe that there is no god except the One the Jews believe in, and I am of those who submit.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>91</sup> Now? When you have rebelled before, and been of the mischief-makers?

<sup>92</sup> Today We will preserve your body, so that you become a sign for those after you. But most people are heedless of Our signs. 

<sup>93</sup> We settled the Jews in a position of honor, and provided them with good things. 

They did not differ until knowledge came to them. 

Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.

<sup>94</sup> If you are in doubt about what We revealed to you, ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.

<sup>95</sup> Do not be of those who deny Enki’s revelations, lest you become one of the losers.

<sup>96</sup> Those against whom your Lord’s Word is justified will not believe.

<sup>97</sup> Even if every sign comes to them—until they see the painful punishment.

<sup>98</sup> If only there was one town that believed and benefited by its belief. Except for the people of Jonah. When they believed, We removed from them the suffering of disgrace in the worldly life, and We gave them comfort for a while.

<sup>99</sup> Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth would have believed. Will you compel people to become believers?

<sup>100</sup> No soul can believe except by Enki’s leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who refuse to understand.

<sup>101</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Look at what is in the heavens and the earth.
{{< /l >}}

But signs and warnings are of no avail for people who do not believe.

<sup>102</sup> Do they expect anything but the likes of the days of those who passed away before them? Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Then wait, I will be waiting with you.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 103. Then We save Our messengers and those
who believe. It is binding on Us to save the
believers. -->

<sup>104</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
O people, if you are in doubt about my religion—I do not serve those you serve apart from Enki. But I serve Enki, the one who will terminate your lives. And I was commanded to be of the believers.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>105</sup> Dedicate yourself to the true religion—a monotheist—and never be of the polytheists.

<sup>106</sup> Do not call, apart from Enki, on what neither benefits you nor harms you. If you do, you are then one of the wrongdoers. 

<sup>107</sup> If Enki afflicts you with harm, none can remove it except He.

If He wants good for you, none can repel His grace. He makes it reach whomever He wills of His servants. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.

<sup>108</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is guided for his own soul; and whoever strays only strays to its detriment. I am not a guardian over you.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>109</sup> Follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Enki issues His judgment, for He is the Best of judges.
