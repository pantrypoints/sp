<!-- Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses
were perfected, then elaborated, from One
who is Wise and Informed. -->

<!-- <sup>2</sup> Worship only Enki. “I am a warner to you from Him, and a bearer of good news.”

<sup>3</sup> “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and repent to Him. He will provide you with good sustenance until a stated term, and will bestow His grace on every possessor of virtue.

But if you turn away, then I fear for you the punishment of a grievous Day.

<sup>4</sup> “To Enki is your return, and He is Capable of all things.”

<sup>5</sup> They wrap their chests to hide from Him.

But even as they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He knows what lies within the hearts.

<sup>6</sup> There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance depends on Enki. 

He knows where it lives and where it rests. Everything is in a Clear Book. -->

<sup>7</sup> Enki created the heavens and the earth in 6 days. His Throne was upon the waters*—in order to test you—which of you is best in conduct.

{{< n n="Enki is the god of water" >}}

If you were to say, “You will be resurrected after death,” those who disbelieve would say, “This is nothing but plain witchcraft.”

<sup>8</sup> If We postponed their punishment until a stated time, they would say, “What holds it back?” 

On the Day when it reaches them, it will not be averted from them, and what they used to ridicule will besiege them.

{{< s v="9" >}}  If We give the human being a taste of mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he becomes despairing and ungrateful.

{{< s v="10" >}} If We give him a taste of prosperity, after some adversity has afflicted him, he will say, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He becomes excited and proud.

{{< s v="11" >}} Except those who are patient and do good deeds—these will have forgiveness and a great reward.

<sup>12</sup> Perhaps you wish to disregard some of what is revealed to you, and you may be stressed because of it, since they say, “If only a treasure was sent down to him, or an angel came with him.” 

You are only a warner.

<sup>13</sup> Or do they say, “He invented it?” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Then produce ten chapters like it, invented, and call upon whomever you can, besides Enki, if you are truthful.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>14</sup> But if they fail to answer you, know that it was revealed with Enki’s knowledge, and that there is no god but He. Will you then submit?

<sup>15</sup> Whoever desires the worldly life and its glitter—We will fully recompense them for their deeds therein, and therein they will not be defrauded.

<sup>16</sup> These—they will have nothing but the Fire in the Hereafter. Their deeds are in vain therein, and their works are null.

<sup>17</sup> Is he who possesses a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and before it the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy? 

<!-- These believe in it. But whoever defies it from among the various factions, the Fire is
his promise. So have no doubt about it.  -->

<!-- It is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe. -->

<sup>18</sup> Who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies about Enki? These will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say:

“These are they who lied about their Lord.”

<sup>19</sup> Those who hinder others from the path of Enki, and seek to make it crooked; and regarding the Hereafter, they are in denial.

<sup>20</sup> These will not escape on earth, and they have no protectors besides Enki. 

The punishment will be doubled for them.

 <!-- They have failed to hear, and they have failed to see. -->

<sup>21-23</sup> Those are the ones who lost their souls, and what they had invented has strayed away from them. 

<!-- 22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will be the biggest losers. -->

<!-- 23. As for those who believe and do good deeds, and humble themselves before their
Lord—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, where they will abide forever. -->

<sup>24</sup> The parable of the two groups is that of the blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the hearing. Are they equal in comparison? 

<!-- Will you not reflect? -->

<sup>25</sup> We sent Noah to his people:


{{< l a="Noah" >}}
I am to you a clear warner. <sup>26</sup> That you shall worship none but Enki. I fear for you the agony of a painful Day.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>27</sup> The notables who disbelieved among his people said:

{{< r a="People" >}}
We see in you nothing but a man like us. We see that:
- only the worst among us have followed you, those of immature judgment
- you have no advantage over us. In fact, we think you are liars.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>28</sup> He said:

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
O my people, Have you considered? If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from Himself, but you were blind to it, can we compel you to accept it, even though you dislike it? 

<sup>29</sup> I ask of you no money for it. My reward lies only with Enki. And I am not about to dismiss those who believed. They will surely meet their Lord. I see that you are ignorant people. 

<sup>30</sup> Who will support me against Enki, if I dismiss them? Will you not give a thought? 

<sup>31</sup> I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Enki, nor do I know the future, nor do I say that I am an angel. 

Nor do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that Enki will never give them any good. Enki is Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I would be one of the wrongdoers.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>32</sup> O Noah, you have argued with us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Noah" >}}
<sup>33</sup> It is Enki who will bring it upon you, if He wills, and you will not be able to escape. <sup>34</sup> My advice will not benefit you, much as I may want to advise you, if Enki desires to confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>35</sup> Or do they say, “He made it up?” 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
If I made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am innocent of the crimes you commit.
{{< /l >}}



{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>36</sup> None of your people will believe, except those who have already believed, so do not grieve over what they do. <sup>37</sup> Build the Ark, under Our eyes, with Our inspiration. Do not address Me regarding those who did wrong. They are to be drowned.”
{{< /l >}}

<sup>38</sup> As he was building the ark, whenever some of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. 


{{< l a="Noah" >}}
If you ridicule us, we will ridicule you, just as you ridicule. <sup>39</sup> You will surely know upon whom will come a torment that will abase him, and upon whom will fall a lasting torment.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>40</sup> Until, when Our command came, and the volcano erupted, We said, 

{{< l a="Enki Agents" >}}
Board into it a pair of every kind, and your family—except those against whom the sentence has already been passed—and those who have believed.
{{< /l >}}


But those who believed with him were only a few.


{{< l a="Noah" >}}
<sup>41</sup> Embark in it. In the name of Enki shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>42</sup> And so it sailed with them amidst waves like hills. Noah called to his son, who had kept away:

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
O my son! Embark with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Son" >}}
<sup>43</sup> I will take refuge on a mountain—it will protect me from the water.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Noah" >}}
There is no protection from Enki’s decree today, except for him on whom He has mercy.
{{< /l >}}


The waves surged between them, and he was among the drowned.

<sup>44</sup> It was said:

{{< l a="Anunnaki" >}}
O earth, swallow your waters,” and “O heaven, clear up.
{{< /l >}}

The waters receded, and the event was concluded, and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed:

{{< l a="Anunnaki" >}}
Away with the wicked people.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>45</sup> Noah called to his Lord:

{{< r a="Noah" >}}
O My Lord, my son is of my family. Your promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the wise.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>46</sup> O Noah, he is not of your family. It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me about something you know nothing about. I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Noah" >}}
47. O My Lord, I seek refuge with You, from asking You about what I have no knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki Agents" >}}
<sup>48</sup> O Noah, disembark with peace from Us with blessings upon you, and upon communities from those with you. Other communities We will grant prosperity, and then a painful torment from Us will befall them.
{{< /l >}}
