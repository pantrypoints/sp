<sup>49</sup> These are some stories from the past that we reveal to you. Neither you, nor your people knew them before this. So be patient. The future belongs to the pious.

<sup>50</sup> To Aad, their brother Hud said:

{{< l a="Hud" >}}
O my people, worship Enki. You have no other god besides Him. You do nothing but invent lies. <sup>51</sup> I ask you no wage for it. My wage lies with Him who originated me. 

<sup>52</sup> Ask forgiveness from your Lord. He will release the sky pouring down upon you, and will add strength to your strength. Do not turn away and be wicked.”
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>53</sup> Hud, you did not bring us any evidence. We are not about to abandon our gods at your word. We do not believe you. <sup>54</sup> Some of our gods have possessed you with evil.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Hud" >}}
I call Enki to witness, and you to witness, that I am innocent of what you associate.

<sup>55</sup> Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of you, and do not hesitate. <sup>56</sup> I have placed my trust in Enki, my Lord and your Lord. 

There is not a creature but He holds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a straight path. 

<sup>57</sup> If you turn away, I have conveyed to you what I was sent to you with. My Lord will replace you with another people, and you will not cause Him any harm. 
<!-- My Lord is Guardian over all things. -->
{{< /l >}}


<sup>58</sup> When Our decree came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him. We delivered them from a harsh punishment.

<sup>59</sup> That was Aad. They denied the signs of their Lord, and defied His messengers, and followed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.

<sup>60</sup> They were pursued by a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. Aad blasphemed against their Lord—so away with Aad, the people of Hud.


<sup>61</sup> To Thamood, their brother Saleh said: 

{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
O my people, worship Enki. You have no god other than Him. He initiated you from the earth, and settled you in it. So seek His forgiveness. My Lord is Near and Responsive.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>62</sup> Saleh, we had hopes in you before this. Are you trying to prevent us from worshiping what our parents worship?  We are in serious doubt regarding what you are calling us to.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
<sup>63</sup> O my people, If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him, who would protect me from Enki, if I disobeyed Him? You add nothing for me except loss.

<sup>64</sup> O my people, this is the she-camel of Enki, a sign for you. Let her graze on Enki’s land, and do not harm her, lest an imminent punishment overtakes you.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>65</sup> But they hamstrung her. So He said, “Enjoy yourselves in your homes for 3 days. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”

<sup>66</sup> Then, when Our command came, We saved Saleh and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that day. 

<!-- Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty. -->

<sup>67</sup> The Scream struck those who transgressed. They became motionless bodies in their homes.

<sup>68</sup> As if they had never prospered therein. Thamood rejected their Lord, so away with Thamood.

<sup>69</sup> Our messengers came to Abraham with good news. 

They said, “Peace.” 

He said, “Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted calf.

<sup>70</sup> But when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he became suspicious of them, and conceived a fear of them. 

{{< r a="People" >}}
Do not fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>71</sup> His wife was standing by, so she laughed. 

We gave her good news of Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob.

<sup>72</sup> She said:

{{< r a="Wife" >}}
Alas for me. Shall I give birth, when I am an old woman, and this, my husband, is an old man? This is truly a strange thing.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>73</sup> Do you marvel at the decree of Enki? The mercy and blessings of Enki are upon you, O people of the house. He is Praiseworthy and Glorious.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>74</sup> When Abraham's fear subsided, and the good news had reached him, he started pleading with Us concerning the people of Lot.

<sup>75</sup> Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.

{{< l a="Enki Agents" >}}
O Abraham, refrain from this. The command of your Lord has come; they have incurred an irreversible punishment.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>77</sup> When Our envoys came to Lot, he was anxious and concerned for them.

{{< r a="Lot" >}}
This is a dreadful day.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>78</sup> His people came rushing towards him. They were in the habit of committing sins.

{{< l a="Lot" >}}
O my people, these are my daughters. They are purer for you. So do not embarrass me before my guests. Is there not one reasonable man among you?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>79</sup> You know well that we have no right to your daughters. You know well what we want.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Lot" >}}
<sup>80</sup> If only I had the strength to stop you, or could rely on some strong support.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>81</sup> O Lot, we are the envoys of your Lord; they will not reach you. So set out with your family during the cover of the night, and let none of you look back, except for your wife.

She will be struck by what will strike them. Their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning near?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>82</sup> When Our command came about, We turned it upside down, and We rained down on it stones of baked clay.

<sup>83</sup> Marked from your Lord, and never far from the wrongdoers.
