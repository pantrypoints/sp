<sup>84</sup> Shuaib said to his brothers the Median: 

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
O my people, worship Enki. Do not short measure or short weight. I see you in good circumstances, but I fear for you the agony of an encompassing Day. 

<sup>85</sup> Give full measure and full weight, in all fairness. Do not cheat the people out of their rights. Do not spread corruption in the land.

<sup>86</sup> What is left by Enki is best for you, if you are believers. I am not a guardian over you.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>87</sup> O Shuaib, does your prayer command you that we abandon what our ancestors worshiped, or doing with our wealth what we want? 

You are the one who is intelligent and wise.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
<sup>88</sup> What if I have clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me good livelihood from Himself? 

I have no desire to do what I forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but reform, as far as I can. My success lies only with Enki. In Him I trust, and to Him I turn.

<sup>89</sup> O my people, let not your hostility towards me cause you to suffer what was suffered by the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot are not far away from you. 

<sup>90</sup> Ask your Lord for forgiveness, and repent to Him. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>91</sup> O Shuaib, we do not understand much of what you say. We see that you are weak among us. Were it not for your tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of no value to us.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Shuaib" >}}
<sup>92</sup> O my people, is my tribe more important to you than Enki? Have you turned your backs on Him? 

<sup>93</sup> You will know to whom will come a punishment that will shame him, and who is a liar. So look out. I am on the lookout with you.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>94</sup> When Our command came, We saved Shuaib and those who believed with him. The Blast struck the wrongdoers, and they became motionless bodies in their homes.

<sup>95</sup> As though they never flourished therein. Away with Median, as was done away with Thamood.

<sup>96</sup> We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear mandate <sup>97</sup> to Pharaoh and his nobles. But they followed the command of Pharaoh which was not wise.

<sup>98</sup> He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them into the Fire.

<!-- 99. They were followed by a curse in this, and on the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the
path they followed. -->

<sup>100</sup> These are of the reports of the towns. Some are still standing, some have withered away.

<sup>101</sup> We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. 

Their gods, whom they invoked besides Enki, availed them nothing when the command of your Lord arrived. In fact, they added only to their ruin.


<sup>102</sup> Such is the grip of your Lord when He seizes the towns in the midst of their sins. His grip is most painful, most severe.

<sup>103</sup> In that is a sign for whoever fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which humanity will be gathered together— that is a Day to be witnessed.

<sup>104</sup> We only postpone it until a predetermined time.

On the Day when it arrives, no soul will speak without His permission. Some will be miserable, and some will be happy.

<sup>106</sup> As for those who are miserable, they will be in the Fire. They will have therein sighing and wailing.

<sup>107</sup> Remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.

<sup>108</sup> Those who are happy will be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills—a reward without end.

<sup>109</sup> So be not in doubt regarding what these people worship. They worship only as their ancestors worshiped before. We will pay them their due in full, without any reduction.

<sup>110</sup> We gave Moses the Scripture, but it was disputed. Were it not for a prior word from your Lord, it would have been settled between them. They are in serious doubt concerning it.

<!-- 111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in full for their deeds. He is Aware of everything
they do.

112. So be upright, as you are commanded, along with those who repented with you, and
do not transgress. He is Seeing of everything
you do. -->

<sup>113</sup> Do not incline towards those who do wrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you will have no protectors besides Enki, and you will not be saved. 

<sup>114</sup> Perform the prayer:
- at the borders of the day
- during the approaches of the night.

The good deeds take away the bad deeds. 

<sup>115</sup> Be patient. Enki will not waste the reward of the virtuous.

{{< s v="116" >}} If only there were, among the generations before you, people with wisdom, who spoke
against corruption on earth—except for the few whom We saved. 

But the wrongdoers pursued the luxuries they were indulged in, and thus became guilty.

<sup>117</sup> Your Lord would never destroy the towns wrongfully, while their inhabitants are righteous.

<sup>118</sup> Had your Lord willed, He could have made humanity one community, but they continue to differ.

<sup>119</sup> Except those on whom your Lord has mercy—for that reason He created them. The Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell with jinn and humans, altogether.”

<sup>120</sup> Everything We narrate to you of the history of the messengers is to strengthen your heart. <!-- The truth has come to you in this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the believers. -->

<sup>121-122</sup> Tell the disbelievers: 

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Act according to your ability; and so will we. Wait, and we too are waiting.
