<sup>36</sup> Two youths entered the prison with Joseph.
- One dreamt about pressing wine.
- Another dreamt about carrying bread on my head, from which the birds are eating. 

Tell us their interpretation, as we see that you are one of the righteous.

He said:

{{< s v="37-41" >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
One of you will serve his master wine. The other will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head.

No food is served to you, but I have informed you about it before you have received it. 

That is some of what my Lord has taught me. I have forsaken the tradition of people who do not believe in Enki. Instead, I have followed the faith of my forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Which is better? The diverse lords or Enki, the One, the Supreme?

You should worship Him. The gods of you and your ancestors have no authority from Enki. <!-- Judgment belongs to none but Enki. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. This is the right religion, but most people do not know. -->

<sup>42</sup> Joseph said to the one he thought would be released:

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Mention me to your master.
{{< /l >}}


But Satan caused him to forget mentioning him to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.

<sup>43</sup> The king said:

{{< r a="King" >}}
I see 7 fat cows being eaten by 7 lean ones, and 7 green spikes, and others dried up. Elders, explain to me my vision,
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Elders" >}}
<sup>44</sup> Jumbles of dreams. We know nothing of the interpretation of dreams.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>45</sup> The one who was released said, having remembered after a time:

{{< r a="Prisoner" >}}
I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me out.

<sup>46</sup> Joseph, O man of truth, inform us concerning 7 fat cows being eaten by 7 lean ones, and 7 green spikes, and others dried up, so that I may return to the people, so that they may know.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>47</sup> You will farm for 7 consecutive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it in its spikes, except for the little that you eat. 

<sup>48</sup> Then after that will come 7 difficult ones, which will consume what you have stored for them, except for the little that you have preserved.

<sup>49</sup> Then after that will come a year that brings relief to the people, and during which they will press.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="King" >}}
<sup>50</sup> Bring him to me.
{{< /r >}}

When the envoy came to him, he said:

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Go back to your master. Ask him about the intentions of the women who cut their hands. My Lord is well aware of their schemes.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Envoy" >}}
<sup>51</sup> What was the matter with you women when you tried to seduce Joseph?
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Ladies" >}}
Enki forbid! We knew of no evil committed by him.
{{< /r >}}

The governor’s wife then said:

{{< r a="Wife" >}}
Now the truth is out. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is telling the truth.

<sup>52</sup> “This is that he may know that I did not betray him in secret, and that Enki does not guide the scheming of the betrayers.”

<sup>53</sup> “Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul commands evil, except those on whom my Lord has mercy. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="King" >}}
<sup>54</sup> Bring him to me, and I will reserve him for myself.
{{< /r >}}


After Joseph spoke to the King, the King said: 

{{< r a="King" >}}
This day you are with us established and secure.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>55</sup> Put me in charge of the storehouses of the land; I am honest and knowledgeable.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>56</sup> We thus established Joseph in the land, to live therein wherever he wished. 

<!-- We touch with Our mercy whomever We will, and We never waste the reward of the righteous. -->

<!-- 57. But the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and observed piety. -->

<sup>58</sup> Joseph's brothers came, but did not recognize him. 

<sup>59</sup> When he provided them with their provisions, he said, 

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Bring me a brother of yours. I fill up the measure, and I am the best of hosts. If you do not bring him to me, you will have no measure.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 61. They said, “We will solicit him from his father. We will surely do.” -->

<sup>62</sup> He said to his servants:

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Put their goods in their saddlebags. They will recognize them when they return to their families. Maybe they will come back.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>63</sup> When they returned to their father, they said:

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
Father, we were denied measure unless we send our brother with us. Do not worry, we will take care of him. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Father" >}}
<sup>64</sup> Shall I trust you with him, as I trusted you with his brother before? 
{{< /l >}}

<sup>65</sup> When they opened their baggage, they found that their goods were returned to them. They said:

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
Father, what more do we want? Here are our goods, returned to us. We will provide for our family, and protect our brother, and have an additional camel-load. This is easy commerce.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Father" >}}
I will send him with you if pledge before Enki that you will bring him back unless you get trapped. My sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates. 
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 68. When they entered as their father had instructed them, it did not avail them anything against Enki; it was just a need in the soul of Jacob, which he carried out. 

He was a person of knowledge inasmuch as We had taught him, but most people do not know. -->

<sup>69</sup> Joseph embraced his brother upon seeing him, and said:

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
I am your brother. Do not be saddened by what they used to do.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>70</sup> Then, when he provided them with their provisions, he placed the drinking-cup in his brother’s saddlebag. 

Then an announcer called out:

{{< r a="Announcer" >}}
O people of the caravan, you are thieves. We are missing the king’s goblet. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load. I personally guarantee it.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>72</sup> By Enki, we are not thieves. <sup>74</sup> What shall be his punishment, if you are lying? <sup>75</sup> If we stole it, then our brother will belong to you. Thus we penalize the guilty.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>76</sup> So he pulled the goblet out of his brother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Joseph. He could not have detained his brother under the king’s law, unless Enki so willed.

<!-- We elevate by degrees whomever We will; and above every person of knowledge, there
is one more learned. -->

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>77</sup> If he has stolen, a brother of his has stolen before.
{{< /r >}}


But Joseph kept it to himself, and did not reveal it to them.

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
You are in a worse situation, and Enki is Aware of what you allege.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>78</sup> O noble prince, he has a father, a very old man, so take one of us in his place. We see that you are a good person.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>79</sup> Enki forbid that we should arrest anyone except him in whose possession we found our property; for then we would be unjust.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>80</sup> Their eldest said:

{{< r a="Eldest" >}}
We promised to return him to his father. Don’t you know that your father received a pledge from you before Enki, and in the past you failed with regard to Joseph? I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or Enki decides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>81</sup> Go back to your father, and say, ‘Our father, your son has stolen. We testify only to what we know, and we could not have prevented the unforeseen.’ <sup>82</sup> Ask the town where we were, and the caravan in which we came.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Father" >}}
<sup>83</sup> Rather, your souls have contrived something for you. Patience is a virtue. Perhaps Enki will bring them all back to me.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>84</sup> Then he turned away from them, and said:

{{< r a="Father" >}}
O my bitterness for Joseph.
{{< /r >}}


His eyes turned white from sorrow, and he became depressed.

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>85</sup> By Enki, please stop remembering Joseph until you have ruined your health or you have passed away.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Father" >}}
<sup>86</sup> I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Enki, and I know from Enki what you do not know.

<sup>87</sup> O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of Enki's comfort. None despairs of Enki's comfort except the disbelieving people.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>88</sup> Then, when they entered into his presence, they said:

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
Mighty governor, adversity has befallen us, and our family. We have brought scant merchandise. But give us full measure, and be charitable towards us—Enki rewards the charitable.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>89</sup> Do you realize what you did with Joseph and his brother, in your ignorance?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>90</sup> Is that you, Joseph?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
I am Joseph, and this is my brother.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>91</sup> By Enki, Enki has preferred you over us. We were definitely in the wrong.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
<sup>92</sup> Enki will forgive you. <sup>93</sup> Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my father’s face, and he will recover his sight. Bring your whole family to me.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>94</sup> As the caravan set out, their father said:

{{< l a="Father" >}}
I sense the presence of Joseph, though you may think I am senile.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>95</sup> They said:

{{< r a="Sons" >}}
By Enki, you are still in your old confusion.
{{< /r >}}


Then, when the bearer of good news arrived, he laid it over his face, and he regained his sight. He said:

{{< l a="Father" >}}
Did I not say to you that I know from Enki what you do not know?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Sons" >}}
<sup>97</sup> Father, pray for the forgiveness of our sins.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Father" >}}
<sup>98</sup> I will ask my Lord to forgive you.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>99</sup> Then, when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he embraced his parents, and said:

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Enter Egypt, Enki willing, safe and secure.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>100</sup> He elevated his parents on the throne, and they fell prostrate before him. 

{{< l a="Joseph" >}}
Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of long ago. My Lord has made it come true. He has blessed me, when he released me from prison, and brought you out of the wilderness, after the devil had sown conflict between me and my brothers.

<sup>101</sup> My Lord, You have given me some authority, and taught me some interpretation of events. Initiator of the heavens and the earth. You are my Protector in this life and in the Hereafter. Receive my soul in submission, and unite me with the righteous.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>102</sup> This is news from the past that We reveal to you. You were not present with them when
they plotted and agreed on a plan.

<sup>103</sup> But most people, for all your eagerness, are not believers.

<sup>104</sup> You ask them no wage for it. It is only a reminder for all mankind.

<sup>105</sup> How many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they pass by, paying no attention to them?

<sup>106</sup> And most of them do not believe in Enki unless they associate others.

<sup>107</sup> Do they feel secure that a covering of Enki’s punishment will not come upon them, or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?

<sup>108</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
This is my way; I invite to Enki, based on clear knowledge—I and whoever follows me. 
{{< /l >}}

<!-- Glory be to Enki; and I am not of the polytheists. -->

<sup>109</sup> We did not send before you except men, whom We inspired, from the people of the towns. Have they not roamed the earth and seen the consequences for those before them? 

The Home of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Do you not understand?

<sup>110</sup> Until, when the messengers have despaired, and thought that they were rejected, Our help came to them. We save whomever We will, and Our severity is not averted from the guilty people.

<sup>111</sup> This story is a lesson for the intelligent. 

<!-- This is not a fabricated tale, but a confirmation of what came before it, and a detailed explanation of all things, and guidance, and mercy for people who believe.
