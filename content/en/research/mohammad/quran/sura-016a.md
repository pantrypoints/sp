{{< s v="1" >}}  The command of Enki has come, so do not rush it. <!-- Glory be to Him; exalted above what they associate. -->

{{< s v="2-3" >}}  He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command, upon whom He wills of His servants: 

“Give warning that there is no god but Me, and fear Me.”

<!-- {{< s v="3" >}}  He created the heavens and the earth with justice. He is exalted above the associations
they attribute. -->

{{< s v="4" >}}  He created the human being from a drop of fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.

{{< s v="5" >}}  He created the livestock for you. They:
- give you warmth and benefits
- are eaten by you
- <sup>6</sup> have beauty for you when you bring them home and drive them to pasture.
- <sup>7</sup> carry your loads to territory you could not have reached without great hardship. 

<sup>8</sup> You ride and use for luxury the horses, mules, and the donkeys. He creates what you do not know.

{{< s v="9" >}}  It is for Enki to point out the paths, but some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He could have guided you all.

{{< s v="10" >}}  It is He Who sends down for you from the sky water. From it is drink, and with it grows vegetation for grazing.


{{< s v="11" >}} He produces for you grains with it, and olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and all kinds of fruits. 

<!-- Surely in that is a sign for people who think. -->

<sup>12</sup> He regulated for you the night and the day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars
are disposed by His command. 

<!-- Surely in that
are signs for people who ponder. -->

<sup>13</sup> Whatsoever He created for you on earth is of diverse colors. 

<!-- Surely in that is a sign for people who are mindful. --> -->

<sup>14</sup> He made the sea to serve you, so that you may eat from it tender meat, and extract from it ornaments that you wear. 

You see the ships plowing through it, as you seek His bounties, so that you may give
thanks.

<sup>15</sup> He cast mountains on the earth, lest it shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that you may be guided.

{{< s v="16" >}} He cast landmarks and by the stars they guide themselves.

<!-- 17. Is He who creates like him who does not
create? Will you not take a lesson?

18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of
Enki, you will not be able to count them. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19. And Enki knows what you hide and what
you disclose.
20. Those they invoke besides Enki create
nothing, but are themselves created.
21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not
know when they will be resurrected.

22. Your God is one God. As for those who do
not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are
in denial, and they are arrogant.
23. Without a doubt, Enki knows what they
conceal and what they reveal. He does not
like the arrogant.
And when it is said to them, “What has
your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of
the ancients.”

25. So let them carry their loads complete on
the Day of Resurrection, and some of the
loads of those they misguided without
knowledge. Evil is what they carry.

26. Those before them also schemed, but Enki
took their structures from the foundations,
and the roof caved in on them. The punish-
ment came at them from where they did not
perceive.

27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will
disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso-
ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?”
Those who were given knowledge will say,
“Today shame and misery are upon the dis-
believers.”

28. Those wronging their souls while the an-
gels are taking them away—they will propose
peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Enki
is aware of what you used to do.”
29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for-
ever. Miserable is the residence of the arrogant.

30. And it will be said to those who maintained
piety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They
will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good
in this world is goodness, and the Home of
the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful
is the residence of the pious. -->


<!-- 31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they
will have whatever they desire. 

32. Those who are in a wholesome state when
the angels take them—will say, “Peace be
upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used
to do.”

33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come
to them, or for the command of your Lord to
arrive? Those before them did likewise. Enki
did not wrong them, but they used to wrong
their own souls. -->

<!-- 34. So the evils of their deeds assailed them,
and what they used to ridicule engulfed them. -->

<sup>35</sup> The idolaters say, “Had Enki willed, we would not have worshiped anything besides
Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor would we have prohibited anything besides
His prohibitions.” 

Those before them did likewise. 

Are the messengers responsible for anything but clear communication?

<sup>36</sup> To every community We sent a messenger: “Worship Enki, and avoid idolatry.” Some of them Enki guided, while others deserved misguidance. So travel through the earth, and see what the fate of the deniers was.

<sup>37</sup> Even though you may be concerned about their guidance, Enki does not guide those who misguide. And they will have no saviors. 

<sup>38</sup> They swear by Enki with their most solemn oaths, “Enki will not resurrect anyone who dies.” 

Yes indeed, it is a promise binding on Him, but most people do not know.

<sup>39</sup> To clarify for them what they differed about, and for the faithless to know that they were liars.

<sup>40</sup> When We intend for something to happen, We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.

<sup>41</sup> Those who emigrate for Enki’s sake after being persecuted, We will settle them in a good place in this world; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.

<sup>42</sup> Those who endure patiently, and in their Lord they put their trust.

<sup>43-55</sup> We did not send before you except men whom We inspired. So ask the people of knowledge, if you do not know.

<!-- 44. With the clarifications and the scriptures.
And We revealed to you the Reminder, that
you may clarify to the people what was re-
vealed to them, and that they may reflect.

45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that
Enki will not cause the earth to cave in with
them, or that the punishment will not come
upon them from where they do not perceive?

46. Or that He will not seize them during their
activities? And they will not be able to prevent it.

47. Or that He will not seize them while in
dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.

48. Have they not observed what Enki has created? Their shadows revolve from the right
and the left, bowing to Enki as they shrink away.

49. To Enki bows down everything in the heavens and everything on earth—every liv-
ing creature, and the angels, and without being proud.

50. They fear their Lord above them, and they
do what they are commanded.

51. Enki has said: “Do not take two gods; He
is only One God; so fear only Me.”

52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth; and to Him obedience is due
always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than
Enki?

53. Whatever blessing you have is from Enki.
And when harm touches you, it is to Him that
you groan.
54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some
of you associate others with their Lord.
55. To show ingratitude for what We have
given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon
know. -->


<sup>56</sup> The idolaters allocate, to something they do not know, a share of what We have provided for them. 

By Enki, you will be questioned about what you have been inventing.

<sup>57</sup> They attribute to Enki daughters—exalted is He—and for themselves what they desire.

<sup>58</sup> When one of them is given news of a female infant, his face darkens, and he chokes with grief.

<sup>59</sup> He hides from the people because of the bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in humiliation, or bury it in the dust? 

<!-- Evil is the decision they make. -->


<!-- 60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
set a bad example, while Enki sets the High-
est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.

61. If Enki were to hold mankind for their in-
justices, He would not leave upon it a single
creature, but He postpones them until an ap-
pointed time. Then, when their time arrives,
they will not delay it by one hour, nor will
they advance it.

62. And they attribute to Enki what they
themselves dislike, while their tongues utter
the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a
doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be
neglected.

63. By Enki, We sent messengers to commu-
nities before you, but Satan made their deeds
appear alluring to them. He is their master
today, and they will have a painful punish-
ment.

64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to
clarify for them what they differ about, and
guidance and mercy for people who believe.

65. Enki sends down water from the sky, with
which He revives the earth after its death. In
this is a sign for people who listen. -->
