<sup>66</sup> There is a lesson for you in cattle: 

We give you a drink from their bellies, from between waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing to the drinkers.

<sup>67</sup> From the fruits of date-palms and grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome food. In this is a sign for people who understand.

<sup>68</sup> Your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up hives in the mountains, and in the trees, andin what they construct.”

<sup>69</sup> Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the pathways of your Lord, with precision. 

From their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors, containing healing for the people. Surely in this is a sign for people who reflect.

<!-- 70. Enki created you; then He takes you away.
Some of you will be brought back to the worst
age, so that he will no longer know anything, -->


after having acquired knowledge. Enki is
Omniscient and Omnipotent.

<sup>71</sup> Enki has favored some of you over others in livelihood. Those who are favored would not give their properties to their servants, to the extent of making them partners in it. Will they then renounce Enki’s blessings?

<sup>72</sup> Enki has:
- given you mates from among yourselves
- produced for you, from your mates, children and grandchildren
- provided you with good things. 

<sup>73</sup> Yet they serve besides Enki what possesses no provisions for them in the heavens, nor on earth, nor are they capable.

<!-- <sup>74</sup> So do not cite the examples for Enki. Enki knows, and you do not know. -->

<sup>75</sup> Enki cites the example of:
- a bonded slave who has no power over anything and
- someone to whom We have given plentiful provision, from which he gives secretly and
openly. 

Are they equal in comparison? 

<sup>76</sup> Enki cites the example of 2 men:
- one of them dumb, unable to do anything, and is a burden on his master, achieving nothing good. 
- another commands justice, and is on a straight path. 

They are not equal. 

<!-- 77. To Enki belongs the unseen of the heavens
and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only
as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al-
lah has power over everything. -->

<!-- 78. Enki brought you out of your mothers’
wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave
you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the
brains; that you may give thanks. -->

<sup>79</sup> Have they not seen the birds, flying in the midst of the sky? None sustains them except Enki. In this are signs for people who believe.

<sup>80</sup> Enki has:
- given you in your homes habitats for you
- provided for you:
  - from the hides of livestock portable homes for you, so you can use them when you travel, and when you camp
  - from their wool, and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort for a while

<!-- 81. Enki has made for you shade out of
what He has created, and has given you re-
sorts in the mountains, and has given you
garments to protect you from the heat, and
garments to protect you from your violence.
Thus He completes His blessings upon you,
so that you may submit. -->

<sup>82</sup> But if they turn away, your only duty is clear communication.

<sup>83</sup> They recognize Enki’s blessing, but then deny it, as most of them are ungrateful.

<sup>84</sup> On the Day when We raise up a witness from every community—those who disbelieved will not be permitted, nor will they be excused.

<sup>85</sup> When those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.

<sup>86</sup> When the idolaters see their associates, they will say:

“Our Lord, these are our associates whom we used to invoke besides You.”

They will strike back at them with the saying, “Surely you are liars.”

<sup>87</sup> On that Day they will offer their submission to Enki, and what they had invented will abandon them.

<sup>88</sup> Those who disbelieve and obstruct from Enki’s path—We will add punishment to their punishment, on account of the mischief they used to make.

<sup>89</sup> On the Day when We raise in every community a witness against them, from among them, and bring you as a witness against these. 

We have revealed to you the Book, as an explanation of all things, and guidance, and mercy and good news for those who submit.
