<sup>90</sup> Enki:
- commands justice, and goodness, and generosity towards relatives
- forbids immorality, and injustice, and oppression.

<sup>91</sup> Fulfill Enki’s covenant when you make a covenant. Do not break your oaths after ratifying them. <!-- You have made Enki your
guarantor, and Enki knows what you do. -->

<sup>92</sup> Do not be like her who unravels her yarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means of deception among you, because one community is more prosperous than another. <!-- Enki is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res-
urrection, He will make clear to you everything you had disputed about. -->

<sup>93</sup> Had Enki willed, He would have made you one congregation, but He leaves astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.

<sup>94</sup> Do not use your oaths to deceive one another, so that a foot may not slip after being firm, and you taste misery because you hindered from Enki’s path, and incur a terrible torment.

<sup>95</sup> Do not exchange Enki’s covenant for a small price. <!-- What is with Enki is better for you, if you only knew. -->

<sup>96</sup> What you have runs out, but what is with Enki remains. We will reward those who are patient according to the best of their deeds.

<sup>97</sup> Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while being a believer, We will grant him a good life—and We will reward them according to the best of what they used to do.

<sup>98</sup> When you read the Quran, seek refuge with Enki from Satan the outcast.

<sup>99</sup> He has no authority over those who believe and trust in their Lord.

<sup>100</sup> His authority is only over those who follow him, and those who associate others with Him.

<sup>101</sup> When We substitute a verse in place of another verse—and Enki knows best what He reveals—they say, “You are an impostor.” 

But most of them do not know.

<sup>102</sup> Say:

“The Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabilize those who believe, and as guidance and good news for those who submit.”

<sup>103</sup> We are well aware that they say, “It is a human being who is teaching him.” But the tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while this is a clear Arabic tongue.

<sup>104</sup> Those who do not believe in Enki’s revelations—Enki will not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment.

<sup>105-111</sup> It is those who do not believe in Enki’s revelations who fabricate falsehood. These are the liars.

<!-- 106. Whoever renounces faith in Enki after
having believed—except for someone who is
compelled, while his heart rests securely in
faith—but whoever willingly opens up his
heart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath
from Enki, and for them is a tremendous
torment.

107. That is because they have preferred the worldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al-
lah does not guide the people who refuse.

108. It is they whom Enki has sealed their hearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is
they who are the heedless.

109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter
they will be the losers.

110. But then your Lord—for those who emi-
grated after being persecuted, then struggled
and persevered—your Lord thereafter is For-
giving and Merciful.
111. On the Day when every soul will come
pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid
in full for what it has done, and they will not
be wronged. -->

<sup>112</sup> Enki cites the example of a town that was secure and peaceful, with its livelihood coming to it abundantly from every direction. 

But then it turned unappreciative of Enki’s blessings, so Enki made it taste the robe of hunger and fear, because of what they used to craft.

<sup>113</sup> A messenger from among them had come to them, but they denounced him, so the
punishment seized them in the midst of their wrongdoing.

<sup>114</sup> Eat of the lawful and good things Enki has provided for you, and be thankful for Enki’s
blessings, if it is Him that you serve.

<sup>115</sup> He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and anything consecrated to other than Enki. 

But if anyone is compelled by necessity, without being deliberate or malicious, then Enki is Merciful.


{{< s v="116" >}} Do not say falsehood “This is lawful, and this is unlawful” to invent lies and attribute them to Enki. 
- Those who invent lies and attribute them to Enki will not succeed.
- <sup>117</sup> A brief enjoyment—then they will have a painful punishment.

<sup>118</sup> We have prohibited the Jews what We related to you before. We did not wrong them, but they used to wrong their own selves.

<!-- 119. But towards those who do wrongs in ignorance, and then repent afterwards and re-
form, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and Merciful. -->

<sup>120</sup> Abraham was an exemplary leader, devoted to Enki, a monotheist, and was not of the polytheists.

<sup>121</sup> Thankful for His blessings. He chose him, and guided him to a straight path.

<sup>122</sup> And We gave him goodness in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.

<sup>123</sup> Then We inspired you: “Follow the religion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was not an idol-worshiper.”

<sup>124</sup> The Sabbath was decreed only for those who differed about it. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences.

<sup>125</sup> Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good advice, and debate with them in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is aware of those who stray from His path, and He is aware of those who are guided.


<sup>126</sup> If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the same degree as the injury done to you. But if you resort to patience—it is better for the patient.

<sup>127</sup> So be patient. Your patience is solely from Enki. And do not grieve over them, and do not be stressed by their schemes.

<!-- 128. Enki is with those who are righteous and those who are virtuous.
