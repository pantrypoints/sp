<!-- 1. Praise be to Enki, who revealed the Book to
His servant, and allowed in it no distortion.{{< s v="2" >}}  Valuable—to warn of severe punishment
from Himself; and to deliver good news to the
believers who do righteous deeds, that they
will have an excellent reward.{{< s v="3" >}}  In
106
which they will abide forever. -->
{{< s v="4" >}}  Warn those who say, “Enki has begotten a son.”

{{< s v="5" >}}  They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. Grave is the word that
comes out of their mouths. They say nothing but a lie.

<sup>6</sup> Perhaps you may destroy yourself with grief, chasing after them, if they do not believe in this information.

<sup>7</sup> We made what is upon the earth an ornament for it, to test them as to which of them is best in conduct.

<sup>8</sup> We will turn what is on it into barren waste.{{< s v="9" >}}  Did you know that the People of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wondrous signs?

{{< s v="10" >}}  When the youths took shelter in the cave, they said, “Our Lord, give us mercy from Yourself, and bless our affair with guidance.”

{{< s v="11" >}}  Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years.

<sup>12</sup> Then We awakened them to know which of the two groups could better calculate the length of their stay.

<sup>13</sup> We relate to you their story in truth. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.

<sup>14</sup> And We strengthened their hearts, when they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we will not call on any god besides Him, for then we would have spoken an outrage.”

<sup>15</sup> “These people, our people, have taken to themselves gods other than Him. Why do they not bring a clear proof concerning them? Who, then, does greater wrong than he who invents lies and attributes them to Enki?”

{{< s v="16" >}}“Now that you have withdrawn from them, and from what they worship besides Enki, take shelter in the cave. And your Lord will unfold His mercy for you, and will set your affair towards ease.”

<sup>17</sup> You would have seen the sun, when it rose, veering away from their cave towards the right, and when it sets, moving away from them to the left, as they lay in the midst of the cave. That was one of Enki’s wonders. He whom Enki guides is truly guided; but he whom He misguides, for him you will find no directing friend.

<sup>18</sup> You would think them awake, although they were asleep. And We turned them over to the right, and to the left, with their dog stretching its paws across the threshold. Had you looked at them, you would have turned away from them in flight, and been filled with fear of them.

<sup>19</sup> Even so, We awakened them, so that they may ask one another. A speaker among them said, “How long have you stayed?” They said, “We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” 

They said, “Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed.” “Send one of you to the city, with this money of yours, and let him see which food is most suitable, and let him bring you some provision thereof. And let him be gentle, and let no one become aware of you.”

<sup>20</sup> “If they discover you, they will stone you, or force you back into their religion; then you will never be saved.”

<sup>21</sup> So it was, that We caused them to be discovered, that they would know that the promise of Enki is true, and that of the Hour there is no doubt. As they were disputing their case among themselves, they said, “Build over them a building.” 

Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed over their case said, “We will set up over them a place of worship.”

<sup>22</sup> They will say, “Three, and their fourth being their dog.” 

They will say, “Five, and their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and
their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best their number.” None knows them
except a few. So do not argue concerning them except with an obvious argument, and
do not consult any of them about them.

And never say about anything, “I will do that tomorrow.”

<sup>24</sup> Without saying, “If Enki wills.” And remember your Lord if you forget, and say, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer than this in integrity.”

<sup>25</sup> They stayed in their cave for 300 years, adding 9.

<sup>26</sup> Say, “Enki knows best how long they stayed.” His is the mystery of the heavens and the earth. By Him you see and hear. They have no guardian apart from Him, and He shares His Sovereignty with no one.

<sup>27</sup> Recite what was revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. There is no changing His words, and you will find no refuge except in Him.

<sup>28</sup> Content yourself with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, desiring His Presence. And do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring the glitter of this world.

Do not obey him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance—so he follows his own desires—and his priorities are confused.

<!-- 29. And say, “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills—let him believe. And who-
ever wills—let him disbelieve”. We have pre-
pared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains
will hem them in. And when they cry for re-
lief, they will be relieved with water like mol-
ten brass, which scalds the faces. What a miserable drink, and what a terrible place.
30. As for those who believe and lead a right-
eous life—We will not waste the reward of
those who work righteousness.
31. These will have the Gardens of Eden, be-
neath which rivers flow. Reclining on com-
fortable furnishings, they will be adorned
with bracelets of gold, and will wear green
garments of silk and brocade. What a won-
derful reward, and what an excellent resting-
place. -->


<sup>32</sup> Cite for them the parable of two men.

To one of them We gave two gardens of vine, and We surrounded them with palm-trees, and We placed between them crops.

<sup>33</sup> Both gardens produced their harvest in full, and suffered no loss. And We made a river flow through them.

<sup>34</sup> Thus he had abundant fruits. He said to his friend, as he conversed with him, “I am wealthier than you, and greater in manpower.”

<sup>35</sup> He entered his garden, wronging himself. He said, “I do not think this will ever perish.”

<sup>36</sup> “And I do not think the Hour is coming. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find something better than this in return.”

<sup>37</sup> His friend said to him, as he conversed with him, “Are you being ungrateful to Him who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then evolved you into a man?

<sup>38</sup> But as for me, He is Enki, my Lord, and I never associate with my Lord anyone.

<sup>39</sup> When you entered your garden, why did you not say, “As Enki wills; there is no power except through Enki”? Although you see me inferior to you in wealth and children.

<sup>40</sup> Perhaps my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and release upon it thunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes barren waste.

<sup>41</sup> Or its water will sink into the ground, and you will be unable to draw it.”

<sup>42</sup> Ruin closed in on his crops, and so he began wringing his hands over what he had invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises.

He was saying, “I wish I never associated anyone with my Lord.”

<sup>43</sup> He had no faction to help him besides Enki, and he was helpless.

<sup>44</sup> That is because authority belongs to Enki, the True.
 <!-- He is Best in rewarding, and Best in requiting. -->

<sup>45</sup> Cite for them the parable of the present life: it is like water that We send down from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it but then it becomes debris, scattered by the wind. Enki has absolute power over everything.

<sup>46</sup> Wealth and children are the adornments of the present life. But the things that last, the virtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for reward, and better for hope.

<sup>47</sup> On the Day when We set the mountains in motion; and you see the earth emerging. We gather them together, and leave none of them behind.

<sup>48</sup> They will be presented before your Lord in a row. “You have come to Us as We created you the first time. Although you claimed We would not set a meeting for you.”

<sup>49</sup> The book will be placed, and you will see the sinners fearful of its contents. 

They will say, “Woe to us! What is with this book that leaves nothing, small or big, but it has enumerated it?” They will find everything they had done present. Your Lord does not wrong anyone.

<sup>50</sup> We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” 

So they bowed down, except for Satan. He was of the jinn [Igigi]. He defied the command of his Lord.

Will you take him and his offspring as lords instead of Me, when they are an enemy to you? Evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.

<sup>51</sup> I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I do not take the misleaders for assistants.

<sup>52</sup> On the Day when He will say, “Call on My partners whom you have claimed.” They will call on them, but they will not answer them.

And We will place between them a barrier.

<sup>53</sup> The sinners will see the Fire, and will realize that they will tumble into it. They will find no deliverance from it.

<sup>54</sup> We have elaborated in this Quran for the people every kind of example, but the human being is a most argumentative being.

<sup>55</sup> What prevented people from accepting faith, when guidance has come to them, and from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness? 

Unless they are waiting for the precedent of the ancients to befall them, or to have the punishment come upon them face to face.

<sup>56</sup> We send the messengers only as deliverers of good news and warners. Those who disbelieve argue with false argument, in order to defeat the truth thereby. They take My Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.

<sup>57</sup> Who does greater wrong than he, who, when reminded of his Lord’s revelations, turns away from them, and forgets what his hands have put forward? We have placed coverings over their hearts, lest they understand it, and heaviness in their ears. 

If you call them to guidance, they will not be guided, ever.

<sup>58</sup> Your Lord is the Forgiver, Possessor of Mercy. Were He to call them to account for what they have earned, He would have hastened the punishment for them. But they have an appointment from which they will find no escape.

<sup>59</sup> We destroyed these towns when they committed injustices<!-- , and We set for their destruction an appointed time -->.
