<!-- {{< s v="1" >}}  Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad A mention of the mercy of your Lord towards His servant .{{< s v="3" >}}  When he called on his Lord, a call in seclusion. -->

{{< s v="1-8" >}}  Zechariah called to the Lord in seclusion: 

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“My Lord, my bones have become feeble. My hair is gray. I have never been disappointed in my prayer to you. I fear for my dependents after me. My wife is barren. So grant me an heir from Yourself, and to inherit the House of Jacob and make him pleasing."
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
“O Zechariah, We give you good news of a son, whose name is John, a name We have
never given before."
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I am old?"
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="9" >}} 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
“It is easy for me. I created you before, when you were nothing."
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="10" >}}

{{< r a="Zechariah" >}}
“My Lord, give me a sign."
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
“Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for 3 nights straight.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="11" >}} So he came out from the sanctuary, and sign-languaged to them to praise morning and evening.


<!-- 12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,”
and We gave him wisdom in his youth.

13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence.
He was devout.

14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a
disobedient tyrant.

15. And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is raised alive. -->

{{< s v="16" >}} Mary withdrew from her family to move to an eastern location.
<!-- - She screened herself away from them. -->
- We sent to her Our spirit which appeared to her as an immaculate human.

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
<sup>18</sup> I take refuge from you should you be righteous.”
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I am only the messenger of your Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
<sup>20</sup> How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I was never unchaste?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Man" >}}
<sup>21</sup> Your Lord said `It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign for humanity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decided.'
{{< /r >}}


<sup>22</sup> So she carried him, and secluded herself with him in a remote place.

<sup>23</sup> The labor-pains came upon her, by the trunk of a palm-tree.

{{< l a="Mary" >}}
I wish I had died before this, and been completely forgotten.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>24-26</sup> [from inside her]: “Do not worry. Your Lord has placed a stream beneath you. Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you. So eat, and drink, and be consoled.

If you see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast so I will not speak to any human today.'
{{< /r >}}


<sup>27</sup> Then she came to her people, carrying the baby Jesus.


{{< r a="People" >}}
O Mary, sister of Aaron, you have done something terrible. Your father was not an evil man, and your mother was not a whore.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>29</sup> Mary pointed to baby Jesus.

{{< r a="People" >}}
How can we speak to a baby?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>30-32</sup> I am the servant of Enki. He has:
- given me the Scripture, and made me a prophet.
- made me blessed wherever I may be
- enjoined on me prayer and charity, so long as I live.

Be kind to my mother. Enki did not make me a disobedient rebel.


<sup>33</sup> So Peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the Day I get resurrected alive.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 34. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of truth about which they doubt. -->


### Enki has no sons

<sup>35</sup> It is not for Enki to have a son because to have anything done, He says “Be” and it becomes.


{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Enki is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>37</sup> But the various factions differed among themselves. <!-- So woe to those who disbelieve
from the scene of a tremendous Day.  -->
- <sup>38</sup> Listen to them and watch for them the Day they come to Us. <!-- But the wrongdoers today
are completely lost. -->
- <sup>39</sup> Warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. Yet they are
heedless, and they do not believe.

<sup>40</sup> It is We who will inherit the earth and everyone on it, and to Us they will be returned.
