<!-- 1. Ta, Ha. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  We did not reveal the Quran for you to suffer, but only as a reminder for those who fear Enki.

<!-- revelation from He who created the earth and the high heavens. -->
<!-- 4. A
The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set-
tled. -->
<!-- 6. To Enki belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth, and everything between them,
and everything beneath the soil.
7. If you speak aloud—He knows the secret,
and the most hidden.

8. Enki, there is no god but He, His are the
Most Beautiful Names.{{< s v="5" >}} {{< s v="9" >}}  Has
the story of Moses reached you? -->

Moses saw a fire so he said to his family,

“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can bring you a torch therefrom, or find some guidance by the fire.”

{{< s v="11" >}}  Then, when he reached it, It said: 

{{< s v="12" >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
I am your Lord. Take off your shoes. You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.

I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed.

I am Enki. There is no God but I. So serve Me, and practice the prayer for My remembrance.

15. The Hour is coming—but I keep it almost hidden—so that each soul will be paid for what it endeavors.

{{< s v="16" >}}And do not let him who denies it and follows his desire turn you away from it, lest you fall.

17. And what is that in your right-hand, O Moses?”
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Moses" >}}
This is my staff. I lean on it, herd my sheep with it, and use it for other things.
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="10" >}} 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Throw it, O Moses.”
{{< /l >}}

So he threw it and it became a moving serpent.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Grab it and do not fear. We will restore it to its original condition.

Press your hand to your side; it will come out white, without a blemish—another
sign.

<!-- 20.
23. That We may show you some of Our greatest signs. -->

Go to Pharaoh; He has transgressed.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Moses" >}}
My Lord, put my heart at peace for me and ease my task for me. untie the knot from my tongue so they can understand my  speech.
appoint an assistant for me, from my family. Strengthen me and Aaron, my brother who will share in my mission.
{{< /r >}}
<!-- 33. That we may glorify You much.
34. And remember You much.
35. You
are always watching over us.” -->

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Your request is granted. 

37. We had favored you previously when We inspired your mother to cast you into the river. The river will wash him to shore, where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will pick him up so that you may be reared before My eye.

40. Your sister walked along and said, ‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take care of him?' 

So We returned you to your mother, that she may not be sad. 

You killed someone, but We saved you from stress. We tested you thoroughly. You stayed years among the people of Median. Then you came back, as ordained.

43. Go to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized But speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will remember, or have some fear.”

Do not fear, I am with you

Tell Pharaoh `We are the messengers of your Lord; so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not torment them.
We bring you a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon him who follows guidance.

48. It was revealed to us that the punishment falls upon him who disbelieves and turns away.'
