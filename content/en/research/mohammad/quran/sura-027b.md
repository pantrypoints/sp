<sup>45</sup> We sent to Thamood their brother Saleh: “Worship Enki.” But they became 2 disputing factions.


<sup>46</sup> He said:

{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
O my people, why are you quick to do evil rather than good? If only you would seek Enki’s forgiveness, so that you may be shown mercy.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>47</sup> We consider you an ill omen, and those with you.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Saleh" >}}
Your omen is with Enki. In fact, you are a people being tested.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>48</sup> In the city was a gang of nine who made mischief in the land and did no good.

<sup>49</sup> They said:

{{< r a="Gang" >}}
Swear by Enki to one another that we will attack him and his family by night. Tell his guardian that we did not witness the murder of his family, and we are being truthful.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>50</sup> They made a plan, and We made a plan, but they did not notice.

<sup>51</sup> So note the outcome of their planning; We destroyed them and their people.

<sup>52</sup> Here are their homes, in ruins, on account of their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for people who know. 

<sup>53</sup> We saved those who believed and were pious.

<sup>54</sup> Lot said to his people:

{{< l a="Lot" >}}
Do you commit lewdness with open eyes? 55. Do you lust after men instead of women? You are truly ignorant people.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>56</sup> Expel the family of Lot from the town. They are purist people.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>57-58</sup> So We saved him and his family, except for his wife, whom We destined to be among the laggards.

<sup>59</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Praise Enki, and peace be upon His servants whom He has selected. Is Enki better, or what they associate?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>60</sup> Or, who created the heavens and the earth, and rains down water from the sky for you? With it We produce gardens full of beauty, whose trees you could not have produced. Is there another god with Enki? But they are a people who equate.

<sup>61</sup> Or, who made the earth habitable, and made rivers flow through it, and set mountains on it, and placed a partition between the two seas?

<sup>62</sup> Or, who answers the one in need when he prays to Him, and relieves adversity, and makes you successors on earth? Is there another god with Enki? How hardly you pay attention.

<sup>63</sup> Or, who guides you through the darkness of land and sea, and who sends the winds as heralds of His mercy?

<sup>64</sup> Or, who originates the creation and then repeats it, and who gives you livelihood from the sky and the earth? Is there another god with Enki? 

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Produce your evidence, if you are truthful. 65. No one in the heavens or on earth knows the future except Enki; and they do
not perceive when they will be resurrected.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>66</sup> In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter is confused. In fact, they are in doubt about it. In fact, they are blind to it.

<sup>67</sup> Those who disbelieve say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
When we have become dust, and our ancestors, shall we be brought out? 68. We were promised that before, we and our ancestors—these are nothing but legends of the ancients.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>69</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Travel through the earth, and observe the fate of the guilty.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>70</sup> But do not grieve over them, and do not be troubled by what they plot.

<sup>71</sup> They say:

{{< r a="People" >}}
When is this promise?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>72-73</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Perhaps some of what you are impatient for has drawn near.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>75</sup> There is no mystery in the heaven and the earth, but it is in a Clear Book.

<sup>76-79</sup> This Quran relates to the Jews most of what they differ about.

<sup>80</sup> You cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call if they turn their backs and flee.

<sup>81</sup> Nor can you guide the blind out of their straying. You can make no one listen, except those who believe in Our verses; for they are Muslims.

<sup>82</sup> When the Word has fallen on them, We will bring out for them from the earth a creature which will say to them that the people are uncertain of Our revelations.

<sup>83</sup> On the Day when We gather from every community a group of those who rejected Our revelations, they will be restrained. <sup>84</sup> Until, when they arrive, He will say:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Did you reject My revelations without comprehending them? Or what is it you were doing?”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>85</sup> The Word will come down on them for their wrongdoing, and they will not speak.

<sup>86</sup> Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest therein, and the day for visibility? Surely in that are signs for people who believe.

<sup>87</sup> On the Day when the Trumpet is blown, everyone in the heavens and the earth will be horrified, except whomever Enki wills. Everyone will come before Him in humility.

<sup>88</sup> You see the mountains, and imagine them fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the clouds—the making of Enki, who has perfected everything. 

<sup>89</sup> Whoever brings a virtue will receive better than it—and they will be safe from the horrors of that Day.

<sup>90</sup> But whoever brings evil—their faces will be tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded except for what you used to do? 


{{< r a="Mohammad" >}}
<sup>91-92</sup> “I was commanded to worship the Lord of this town, who has sanctified it, and to Whom everything belongs. I was commanded to be of those who submit. I am one of the warners.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- 92. Whoever is guided—is guided to his own advantage. And whoever goes astray, then say, ”

93. And say, “Praise belongs to Enki; He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you do.” -->
