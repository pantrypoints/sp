43. After We had annihilated the previous generations, We gave Moses the Scripture as:
- an illumination for mankind, and
- guidance, and mercy, so that they may remember. 

44. You were not on the Western Side when We decreed the command to Moses, nor were you among the witnesses.

45. But We established many generations, and time took its toll on them. Nor were you among the people of Median, reciting Our revelations to them. But We kept sending messengers.

46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn people who received no warner before you, so that they may take heed.

47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a result of what their hands have perpetrated, they would say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations, and been among the believers.
{{< /r >}}


48. But when the truth came to them from Us, they said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If only he was given the like of what was given to Moses.
{{< /r >}}

Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses in the past? 

They said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Two works of magic backing one another. We are disbelieving in both.
{{< /r >}}


49. Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Then bring a scripture from Enki, more conductive to guidance than both, and I will follow it, if you are truthful.
{{< /l >}}


50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that they follow their fancies. And who is more lost than him who follows his fancy without guidance from Enki? Enki does not guide the unjust people.

51. We have delivered the Word to them, that they may remember.

52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it believe in it.

53. When it is recited to them, they say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
We have believed in it; it is the truth from our Lord; we were Muslims prior to it.
{{< /r >}}


54. These will be given their reward twice, because they persevered; and they counter evil with good; and from Our provisions to them, they give.

55. When they hear vain talk, they avoid it, and say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
We have our deeds, and you have your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not desire the ignorant.
{{< /r >}}

56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Enki guides whom He wills, and He knows best those who are guided.

57. They say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched from our land.
{{< /r >}}

Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctuary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits, as provision from Ourselves? But most of them do not know.

58. We destroyed many cities for turning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here are their homes, uninhabited after them, except for a few. And We became the Inheritors.

59. Your Lord never destroys cities without first sending a messenger in their midst, reciting to them Our revelations. And We never destroy the cities, unless their people are wrongdoers.

Whatever thing you are given is but the material of this world, and its glitter. But what is with Enki is better, and longer lasting. Do you not comprehend?

61. Can someone to whom We have made a fine promise—which he will attain—be equal to someone to whom We have given enjoyments in this world, but who will be, on Resurrection Day, among the arraigned?

62. On the Day when He will call to them, and say:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Where are My associates whom you used to claim?
{{< /l >}}


63. Those against whom the sentence is justified will say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Lord, these are they whom we misled. We misled them, as we were misled. We beg Your forgiveness; it was not us they used to worship.
{{< /r >}}

64. And it will be said, “Call on your partners.”

They will call on them, but they will not respond to them. And they will see the suffering. If only they were guided.

65. On the Day when He will call to them, and say:

“What did you answer the Messengers?”

66. They will be blinded by the facts on that Day, and they will not question each other.

67. But he who repents, and believes, and does righteous deeds, may well be among the winners.

<!-- 68. Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and He chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be to Enki, and exalted be He above the associations they make.

69. Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and what they reveal.

70.  He is Enki. There is no god but He. To Him belongs all praise in this life, and in the next. And His is the decision, and to Him you will be returned. -->


71. Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Have you considered? Had Enki made the night perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Enki will bring you illumination? Do you not hear?

72. Have you considered? Had Enki made the day perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, which god other than
Enki will bring you night to rest in?
{{< /l >}}


73. It is out of His mercy that He made for you the night and the day, that you may rest in it, and seek some of His bounty; and that you may give thanks.

74. On the Day when He will call to them, and say:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Where are My associates whom you used to claim?
{{< /l >}}


75. We will draw out from every community a witness, and say: “Produce your evidence.” 

Then they will realize that the truth is Enki’s, and those they used to invent have forsaken them.

76. Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses, but he oppressed them. 

We had given him treasures, the keys of which would weigh down a group of strong men. His people said to him, 

{{< r a="People" >}}
Do not exult; Enki does not love the exultant. 77. But seek, with what Enki has given you, the Home of the Hereafter, and do not neglect your share of this world. Be charitable, as Enki has been charitable to you. 

Do not seek corruption in the land. Enki does not like the seekers of corruption.
{{< /r >}}



78. He said:

{{< l a="Quaroon" >}}
I was given all this on account of knowledge I possess.
{{< /l >}}

Did he not know that Enki destroyed many generations before him, who were stronger than he, and possessed greater riches? But the guilty will not be asked about their sins.

79. He went out before his people in his splendor. Those who desired the worldly life said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
If only we possessed the likes of what Quaroon was given. He is very fortunate.
{{< /r>}}
 

80. But those who were given knowledge said:

{{< l a="Knowledeable" >}}
Woe to you! The reward of Enki is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds.
{{< /l >}}

Yet none attains it except the steadfast.

81. So We caused the earth to cave in on him and his mansion. He had no company to save him from Enki, and he could not defend himself.

82. Those who had wished they were in his position the day before were saying:

{{< l a="Knowledeable" >}}
It is Enki who spreads the bounty to whomever He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had Enki not been gracious to us, He would have caved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful never prosper.
{{< /l >}}


83. That Home of the Hereafter—We assign it for those who seek no superiority on earth, nor corruption. And the outcome is for the cautious.

84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better than it. But whoever brings evil—the evildoers will be rewarded only according to what they used to do.

<!-- 85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will
return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best
who comes with guidance, and who is in
manifest error.”

86. You did not expect the Scripture to be
transmitted to you, except as mercy from
your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter
of the disbelievers.

87. And do not let them divert you from Al-
lah’s revelations after they have been revealed
to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be
of the polytheists.

88. And do not invoke with Enki any other
god. There is no god but He. All things per-
ish, except His presence. His is the judgment,
and to Him you will be returned.
