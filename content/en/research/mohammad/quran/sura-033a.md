{{< s v="1" >}}  O Prophet! Fear Enki, and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites. 

<!-- Enki is
Knowledgeable and Wise. -->

{{< s v="2" >}} Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Enki is fully aware of what you do.

{{< s v="3" >}} Put your trust in Enki. Enki is enough as a trustee.

{{< s v="4" >}} Enki did not place 2 hearts inside any man's body. Nor did He make your wives whom you equate with your mothers, your actual mothers.

Nor did He make your adopted sons, your actual sons. These are your words coming out of your mouths. 

{{< s v="5" >}}  Call them after their fathers. That is more equitable with Enki.

But if you do not know their fathers, then your brethren in faith and your friends. There is no blame on you if you err therein, barring what your hearts premeditates.

{{< s v="6" >}} The Prophet is more caring of the believers than they are of themselves. 

His wives are mothers to them. 

Blood-relatives are closer to one another in Enki’s Book than the believers or the emigrants, though you should do good to your friends. 

That is inscribed in the Book.


<sup>7</sup> Recall that We received a pledge from the prophets, and from you, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus. 

We received from them a solemn pledge.

<sup>8</sup> That He may ask the sincere about their sincerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.

{{< s v="9" >}}  Muslims, remember Enki’s blessings upon you.

When forces came against you We sent against them a wind and forces that you did not see. 

<!-- Enki is Observant of what you do. -->

{{< s v="10" >}} They came from above you and beneath you.

The eyes became dazed, and the hearts reached the throats, and you harbored doubts about Enki.

{{< s v="11" >}} There and then the believers were tested, and were shaken most severely.

<sup>12</sup> The hypocrites and those with sick hearts said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Enki and His Messenger promised us nothing but illusion.

<sup>13</sup> “O people of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so retreat.” 
{{< /r >}}


A faction of them asked the Prophet to excuse them, saying:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Our homes are exposed
{{< /r >}}

But they were not exposed. 

They only wanted to flee.

<sup>14</sup> Had it been invaded from its sides, and they were asked to dissent, they would have done so with little hesitation.

<sup>15</sup> Although they had made a pledged to Enki in the past, that they will not turn their backs. 

A pledge to Enki is a responsibility.

{{< s v="16" >}} Say:

{{< l a="Mohammad" >}}
Flight will not benefit you, if you flee from death or killing, even then you will be given only brief enjoyment.

<sup>17</sup> Who will shield you from Enki, if He intends adversity for you, or intends mercy for you?
{{< /l >}}

Besides Enki, they will find for themselves neither friend nor helper.

<sup>18</sup> Enki already knows the hinderers among you, and those who say to their brethren, “Come and join us.” 

Rarely do they mobilize for battle.

<sup>19</sup> Being stingy towards you. And when fear approaches, you see them staring at you—their eyes rolling—like someone fainting at death. 

Then, when panic is over, they whip you with sharp tongues. They resent you any good.

These have never believed, so Enki has nullified their works; a matter easy for Enki.


<sup>20</sup> They assumed that the confederates had not withdrawn. 

But were the confederates to advance, they would wish they were in the desert with the Bedouins, inquiring about your news.

If they were among you, they would have done little fighting.

<sup>21</sup> You have an excellent example in the Messenger of Enki. 

<!-- For anyone who seeks Enki and the Last Day, and remembers Enki frequently. -->

<sup>22</sup> When the believers saw the confederates, they said:


 “This is what Enki and His messenger have promised us; and Enki and His messenger have told the truth.” 

It only increased them in faith and submission.

<sup>23</sup> Of the believers are men who are true to what they pledged to Enki. 

Some of them have fulfilled their vows; and some are still waiting, and never wavering.

<sup>24</sup> That Enki may reward the truthful for their truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites, if He wills, or pardon them. Enki is Forgiving and Merciful.

<sup>25</sup> Enki repelled the disbelievers in their rage; they gained no advantage. Enki thus spared the believers combat.

<sup>26</sup> He brought down from their strongholds those of the People of the Book who backed them, and He threw terror into their hearts.

Some of them you killed, and others you took captive.

<sup>27</sup> He made you inherit their land, and their homes, and their possessions, and a region you have never stepped on. 

<!-- Enki has power over all things. -->

<sup>28</sup> O Prophet! Say to your wives:

“If you desire the life of this world and its finery, then let me compensate you, and release you kindly. 

<sup>29</sup> But if you desire Enki, His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then Enki has prepared for the righteous among you a magnificent compensation.”


<sup>30</sup> O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits a proven indecency, the punishment for her will be doubled. 

<!-- And that would
be easy for Enki. -->

But whoever of you remains obedient to Enki and His Messenger, and acts righteously, We will give her a double reward; and
We have prepared for her a generous provision.


<!-- 31.
has ended. The command of Enki was fulfilled. -->

<sup>32</sup> O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women, if you observe piety. So do not speak too softly, lest the sick at heart lusts after you, but speak in an appropriate manner.

<sup>33</sup> Settle in your homes.

Do not display yourselves, as in the former days of ignorance. 

Perform the prayer, and give regular charity, and obey Enki and His Messenger. Enki desires to remove all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and to purify you thoroughly.

<sup>34</sup> Remember what is recited in your homes of Enki's revelations and wisdom. 

<sup>35</sup> Muslim men and Muslim women, believing men and believing women, obedient men and obedient women, truthful men and truthful women, patient men and patient women, humble men and humble women, charitable men and charitable women, fasting men and fasting women, men who guard their chastity and women who guard, men who remember Enki frequently and women who remember—Enki has prepared for them a pardon, and an immense reward.

<sup>36</sup> It is not for any believer, man or woman, when Enki and His Messenger have decided a matter, to have liberty of choice in their decision. 


Whoever disobeys Enki and His Messenger has gone far astray.

<sup>37</sup> When you said to him whom Enki had blessed, and you had favored, “Keep your
wife to yourself, and fear Enki.” But you hid within yourself what Enki was to reveal. 

You feared the people, but it was Enki you were supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid ended his relationship with her, We gave her to you in marriage, that there may be no restriction for believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons, when their relationship

<sup>38</sup> There is no blame on the Prophet regarding what Enki has ordained for him. Such is the pattern of Enki among those who passed before. The command of Enki is an absolute decree.

<sup>39</sup> Those who deliver the messages of Enki, and fear Him, and never fear anyone except Enki. 

<!-- Enki is sufficient as a reckoner. -->

<sup>40</sup> Muhammad is not the father of any of your men; but he is the Messenger of Enki, and the seal of the prophets.

 <!-- Enki is Cognizant of everything. -->

<!-- <sup>4. O you who believe, remember Enki with frequent remembrance.

42. And glorify Him morning and evening. -->

<sup>42</sup> Enki and His angels reaches out to you to bring you out of darkness into the light. 

<!-- He is Ever-Merciful towards the
believers. -->

<sup>44</sup> Their greeting on the Day they meet Him is, “Peace,” and He has prepared for them a generous reward.

<sup>45</sup> O prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of good news, and a warner.

<sup>46</sup> And a caller towards Enki by His leave, and an illuminating beacon.

<sup>47</sup> Give the believers the good news that for them is a great reward.

<sup>48</sup> And do not obey the blasphemers and the hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely
on Enki. Enki is a sufficient protector.

<sup>49</sup> Muslims,  When you marry believing women, but then divorce them before you have touched them, there is no waiting period for you to observe in respect to them; 

But compensate them, and release them in a graceful manner.

<sup>50</sup> O Prophet! We have permitted to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries, and those you already have, as granted to you by Enki, and the daughters of your paternal uncle, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncle, and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you, and a believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her, exclusively for you, and not for the believers.

We know what We have ordained for them regarding their wives and those their righthands possess. This is to spare you any difficulty. Enki is Forgiving and Merciful.

<sup>51</sup> You may defer any of them you wish, and receive any of them you wish. Should you desire any of those you had deferred, there is no blame on you.

This is more proper, so that they will be comforted, and not be grieved, and be content with what you have given
each one of them. 

<!-- Enki knows what is within your hearts.  -->

<sup>52</sup> Beyond that, no other women are permissible for you, nor can you exchange them for other wives, even if you admire their beauty, except those you already have. 

<!-- Enki is Watchful over all things. -->

<sup>53</sup> Muslims, do not enter the homes of the Prophet, unless you are given permission to come for a meal.

Do not wait for its preparation. 

When you are invited, go in.

When you have eaten, disperse, without lingering for conversation. This irritates the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but Enki does not shy away from the truth. 

When you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. You must never offend the Messenger of Enki, nor must you ever marry his wives after him, for that would be an enormity with Enki. 


<sup>54</sup> Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, Enki is Aware of all things.

<sup>55</sup> There is no blame on them concerning their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their women, or their female servants. 

<!-- But they should remain conscious of Enki. Enki
is Witness over all things. -->

<sup>56</sup> Enki and His angels give blessings to the Prophet. O you who believe, call for blessings
on him, and greet him with a prayer of peace.

<sup>57</sup> Those who insult Enki and His Messenger, Enki has cursed them in this life and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a demeaning punishment.

<sup>58</sup> Those who harm believing men and believing women, for acts they did not commit, bear the burden of perjury and a flagrant sin.

<sup>59</sup> O Prophet! Tell your wives, and your daughters, and the women of the believers, to lengthen their garments. That is more proper, so they will be recognized and not harassed. 

<!-- Enki is Forgiving and Merciful. -->

<sup>60</sup> If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the City, do not desist, We will incite you against them; then they will not be your neighbors there except for a short while. 

<sup>61</sup> They are cursed; wherever they are found, they should be captured and killed outright.

<sup>62</sup> Such has been Enki’s precedent with those who passed away before. You will find no change in Enki’s system.

<sup>63</sup> The people ask you about the Hour. Say, “The knowledge thereof rests with Enki. But what do you know? Perhaps the hour is near.”

<sup>64</sup> Enki has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a Blaze. 

<sup>65</sup> Dwelling therein forever, not finding a protector or a savior.

<sup>66</sup> The Day when their faces are flipped into the Fire, they will say:

“If only we had obeyed Enki and obeyed the Messenger.”

<sup>67</sup> They will say:

“Lord, we have obeyed our superiors and our dignitaries, but they led us away from the way.

<sup>68</sup> Lord, give them double the punishment, and curse them with a great curse.”

<sup>69</sup> Muslims,  Do not be like those who abused Moses; but Enki cleared him of what they said. 

<!-- He was distinguished with Al-
lah. -->

<sup>70</sup> Speak in a straightforward manner.

<!-- 71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and will forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Al-
lah and His Messenger has won a great victory.

72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains; but they re-
fused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it; but the human being accepted it. He was un-
fair and ignorant.

73. Enki will punish the hypocrites, men and
women, and the idolaters, men and women.
And Enki will redeem the believers, men and
women. Enki is Ever-Forgiving, Most Mer-
ciful. -->
