{{< s v="1-3" >}}  You {{< s v="4" >}} are one of the messengers. a straight path.

<sup>6</sup> To warn a people whose ancestors were not warned, and so they are unaware.

<sup>7</sup> The Word was realized against most of them, for they do not believe.

<sup>8</sup> We placed shackles around their necks, up to their chins, so they are stiff-necked. {{< s v="9" >}} We placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them, and We have enshrouded them, so they cannot see.

{{< s v="10" >}}  It is the same for them, whether you warn them, or do not warn them—they will not believe. {{< s v="11" >}}  You warn only him who follows the Message, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly.

So give him good news of forgiveness, and a generous reward.

<sup>12.</sup> It is We who revive the dead. We write down what they have forwarded, and their traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear Record.

<sup>13.</sup> And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town—when the messengers
came to it.

<sup>14.</sup> We sent them 2 messengers. But they denied them both, so We reinforced them with
a third. They said:

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
We are messengers to you.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>15.</sup> You are nothing but humans like us. The Gracious did not send down anything. You are only lying.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
<sup>16</sup> Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you. <sup>17.</sup> Our only duty is clear communication.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>18.</sup> We see an evil omen in you. If you do not give up, we will stone you. A painful punishment from us will befall you.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Prophet" >}}
<sup>19.</sup> Your evil omen is on you. Is it because you were reminded? But you are an extravagant people
{{< /l >}}


<sup>20.</sup> Then a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
O my people, follow the messengers. <sup>21.</sup> Follow those who ask you of no wage, and are themselves guided.

<sup>22.</sup> Why should I not worship Him Who created me, and to Whom you will be returned?

<sup>23.</sup> Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If the Merciful desires harm for me, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor will they save me.

<sup>24.</sup> In that case, I would be completely lost. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>26.</sup> It was said, “Enter Paradise.” 

{{< r a="Man" >}}
If only my people knew. <sup>27.</sup> How my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honored.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>28.</sup> After that messenger, We sent down no hosts from heaven to his people; nor would We ever send
any down. 

<sup>29.</sup> It was just one Cry, and they were stilled.

Alas for the servants. No messenger ever came to them, but they ridiculed him.

<sup>31.</sup> Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them? And that unto them they will not return?

<sup>32.</sup> All of them, every single one of them, will be arraigned before Us.

<sup>33</sup> There is a sign for them in the dead land: We give it life, and produce from it grains from which they eat. 

<sup>34</sup> We place in it gardens of palm-trees and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.

<sup>35-36</sup> That they may eat from its fruits, although their hands did not make it. Will they not be appreciative?

<!-- <sup>36</sup> Glory be to Him who created all the pairs; of what the earth produces, and of their own selves, and of what they do not know. -->
