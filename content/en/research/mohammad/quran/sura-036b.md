<sup>37</sup> Another sign for them is the night: We strip the day out of it—and they are in darkness.

<sup>38</sup> The sun runs towards its destination. Such is the design of the Almighty, the All-
Knowing.

<sup>39</sup> We have disposed the moon in phases, until it returns like the old twig.

<sup>40</sup> The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an orbit.

<sup>41</sup> Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring in Noah's Ark.

<!-- the laden -->

<sup>42</sup> We created for them the like of it, in which they ride.

<sup>43</sup> If We will, We can drown them—with no screaming to be heard from them.*

{{< n n="The Anunnaki created the Deluge to destroy all humans who had rebelled and wanted freedom" >}}

<!-- , nor will they be saved.  -->

<sup>44</sup> Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment for a while.

<sup>45</sup> Yet when it is said to them:

{{< q a="Enki" >}}
Beware of what lies before you, and what lies behind you, that you may receive mercy.
{{< /q >}}

<sup>46</sup> Yet never came to them a sign of their Lord’s signs, but they turned away from it.

<sup>47</sup> We say to them:

{{< q a="Enki" >}}
Spend of what Enki has provided for you
{{< /q >}}

The disbelievers say to the believers:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Shall we feed someone whom Enki could feed, if He so willed? You must be deeply misguided.

<sup>48</sup> When will this promise be, if you are truthful?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>49</sup> All they can expect is a single blast, which will seize them while they feud.

<sup>50</sup> They will not be able to make a will, nor will they return to their families.

<sup>51</sup> The Trumpet will be blown, then behold, they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.

<sup>52</sup> They will say:

{{< l a="Believers" >}}
Woe to us! Who resurrected us from our resting-place?” This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the messengers have spoken the truth.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>53</sup> It will be but a single scream. They will all be brought before Us.

<sup>54</sup> On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the least. You will be recompensed only for what you used to do.

<sup>55</sup> The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day, will be happily busy.

<sup>56</sup> They and their spouses, in shades, reclining on couches.

<sup>57</sup> They will have therein fruits. They will have whatever they call for.

<sup>58</sup> Peace—a saying from a Most Merciful Lord.*

{{< n n="Here Enki bribes the rebellious human slaves into making them masters in exchange for peace" >}}


<sup>59</sup> But step aside today, you criminals. O Children of Adam, that you shall not serve the devil? That he is your sworn enemy?

<sup>60</sup> Did I not covenant with you <sup>61</sup> that you shall serve Me?* This is a straight path.

{{< n n="This is proof that Allah is Enki who created humans from Homo Erectus to be his slaves. The devil here is the rebel leaders" >}}

<sup>62</sup> He has misled a great multitude of you. Did you not understand?

<sup>64</sup> This is Hellfire, which you were promised. 

Roast in it today, because you persistently disbelieved.

<sup>65</sup> On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to everything they had done.

<sup>66</sup> If We will, We can blind their eyes as they rush towards the path—but how will they see?

<sup>67</sup> If We will, We can cripple them in their place. So they can neither move forward, nor go back. 

<sup>68</sup> Whomever We grant old age, We reverse his development*. Do they not understand?

{{< n n="The Anunnaki had mastered the human DNA" >}}


<sup>69</sup> We did not teach him poetry, nor is it proper for him. It is only a reminder, and a Clear Quran.

<sup>70</sup> That he may warn whoever is alive, and prove the Word against the faithless.

<sup>71</sup> Have they not seen that We created for them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they own?

<sup>72</sup> We subdued them for them. Some they ride, and some they eat.

<sup>73</sup> They have in them other benefits, and drinks. Will they not give thanks?

<sup>74</sup> Yet they have taken to themselves gods other than Enki, that perhaps they may be helped. 

<sup>75</sup> They cannot help them, although they are arrayed as troops for them.

<sup>76</sup> So let their words not sadden you. We know what they conceal, and what they reveal.

<sup>77</sup> Does the human being not consider that We created him from a seed?*  Yet he becomes a fierce adversary.

{{< n n="Here Enki complains that the Anunnaki did so much hard work to create human slaves, yet humans rebel and want freedom" >}}

<sup>76</sup> He produces arguments against Us, and he forgets his own creation. He says:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Who will revive the bones when they have decayed?
{{< /r >}}

<sup>79</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
He who initiated them in the first instance will revive them. He has knowledge of every creation.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>80</sup> He who produced fuel for you from the green trees, with which you kindle a fire.



<!-- <sup>81</sup> Is not He who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Certainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Creator.

<sup>82</sup> His command, when He wills a thing, is to say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.

<sup>83</sup> So glory be to Him in whose hand is the dominion of everything, and to Him you will be returned.  -->
