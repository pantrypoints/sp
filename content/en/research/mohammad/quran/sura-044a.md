<!-- {{< s v="1" >}}  Ha, Meem. -->

{{< s v="2" >}}  By the Enlightening Scripture.{{< s v="3" >}}  We have revealed it on a Blessed Night—We have warned.

{{< s v="4" >}}  In it is distinguished every wise command. A decree from Us. We have been sending messages.

<sup>6</sup> As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, the Knower.

<sup>7</sup> Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you know for sure.

<sup>8</sup> There is no god but He. He gives life and causes death—your Lord and Lord of your ancestors of old. Yet they play around in doubt.

{{< s v="10" >}} So watch out for the Day when the sky produces a visible smoke. {{< s v="11" >}}  Enveloping mankind; this is a painful punishment.


{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>12</sup> Our Lord, lift the torment from us, we are believers.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>13.</sup> But how can they be reminded? An enlightening messenger has already come to them.

<sup>14.</sup> But they turned away from him, and said, “Educated, but crazy!”

<sup>15.</sup> We will ease the punishment a little, but you will revert.

{{< s v="16" >}} The Day when We launch the Great Assault—We will avenge.

<sup>17.</sup> Before them We tested the people of Pharaoh; a noble messenger came to them.

<sup>18</sup> Saying:

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
Hand over Enki’s servants to me. I am an honest messenger to you. <sup>19</sup> Do not exalt yourselves above Enki. I come to you with clear authority. <sup>20</sup> I have taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me. <sup>21</sup> But if you do not believe in me, keep away from me.”
{{< /r >}}


<sup>22</sup> He appealed to his Lord: 

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
These are a sinful people.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>23</sup> Set out with My servants by night—you will be followed <sup>24</sup> and cross the sea quickly; they are an army to be drowned.
{{< /l >}}



<sup>25.</sup> How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind? <sup>26.</sup> And plantations, and splendid buildings. <sup>27.</sup> And comforts they used to enjoy.

<sup>28.</sup> So it was; and We passed it on to another people.

<sup>29.</sup> Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor were they reprieved.

<sup>30.</sup> We delivered the Jews from the humiliating persecution.

<sup>31.</sup> From Pharaoh. He was a transgressing tyrant.

<sup>32.</sup> We chose them knowingly over all other people.

<sup>33.</sup> We gave them many signs, in which was an obvious test.

<sup>34.</sup> These people say:

<sup>35</sup> “There is nothing but our first death, and we will not be resurrected. <sup>36</sup> Bring back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”

<sup>37.</sup> Are they better, or the people of Tubba and those before them? We annihilated them.

<sup>38</sup> We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them to play.

<sup>39</sup> We created them only for a specific purpose, but most of them do not know.

<sup>40</sup> The Day of Sorting Out is the appointed time for them all.

<sup>41</sup> The Day when no friend will avail a friend in any way, and they will not be helped.

<sup>42</sup> Except for him upon whom Enki has mercy. He is the Mighty, the Merciful.

<sup>43</sup> The Tree of Bitterness.

<sup>44</sup> The food of the sinner.

<sup>45</sup> Like molten lead boiling inside the bellies.

<sup>46</sup> Like the boiling of seething water.

<sup>47</sup> Seize him and drag him into the midst of Hell!

<sup>48</sup> Then pour over his head the suffering of the Inferno!

<sup>49</sup> Taste! You who were powerful and noble.

<sup>50</sup> This is what you used to doubt.

<sup>51</sup> As for the righteous, they will be in a secure place.

<sup>52</sup> Amidst gardens and springs.

<sup>53</sup> Dressed in silk and brocade, facing one another.

<sup>54</sup> So it is, and We will wed them to lovely companions.

<sup>55</sup> They will call therein for every kind of fruit, in peace and security.

<sup>56</sup> Therein they will not taste death, beyond the first death; and He will protect them from
the torment of Hell.

<sup>57</sup> A favor from your Lord. That is the supreme salvation.

<sup>58</sup> We made it easy in your language, so that they may remember.

<sup>59</sup> So wait and watch. They too are waiting and watching.
