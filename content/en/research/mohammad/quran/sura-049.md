{{< s v="1" >}}  Do not place your opinions above that of Enki and His Messenger. 

{{< s v="2" >}}  Muslims, do not:
- speak louder than the voice of the Prophet
- speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another


{{< s v="3" >}}  Those who lower their voices before the Propphet Mohammad have hearts which Enki have tested for piety. 

{{< s v="4" >}}  Those who call you from behind the chambers—most of them do not understand.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Had they remained patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. 

<sup>6</sup> Muslims,  If a troublemaker brings you any news, investigate, lest you harm people out of ignorance, and you become regretful for what you have done.

<sup>7-8</sup> Among you is the Messenger of Enki. Had he obeyed you in many things, you would have suffered hardship. 

But Enki has given you the love of faith, and adorned it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mischief, and rebellion hateful to you. These are the rightly guided.

<!-- <sup>8</sup> A Grace and Favor from Enki. Enki is Knowing and Wise. -->

<sup>9</sup> If two groups of believers fight each other, reconcile between them. 

But if one group aggresses against the other, fight the aggressing group until it complies with Enki’s command.

Once it has complied, reconcile between them with justice, and be equitable. 

{{< s v="10" >}}  The believers are brothers, so reconcile between your brothers, and remain conscious of Enki, so that you may receive mercy.

{{< s v="11" >}}  Muslims,  No people shall ridicule other people, for they may be better than they. Nor shall any women ridicule other women, for they may be better than they. 

Nor shall you slander one another, nor shall you insult one another with names. Evil is the return to wickedness after having attained faith. Whoever does not repent—these are the wrongdoers.

<sup>12</sup> Muslims, avoid most suspicion—some suspicion is sinful. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another. 

Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it.

<sup>13</sup> O people! We created you from a male and a female, and made you races and tribes, that
you may know one another. <!-- The best among you in the sight of Enki is the most righteous.
Enki is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced. -->

<sup>14</sup> The Desert-Arabs say, “We have believed.”

Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered into your hearts. But if you obey Enki and His Messenger, He will not diminish any of your deeds.”

<sup>15</sup> The believers are those who believe in Enki and His Messenger, and then have not doubted, and strive for Enki’s cause with their wealth and their persons. These are the sincere.

{{< s v="16" >}} Say, “Are you going to teach Enki about your religion, when Enki knows everything
in the heavens and the earth, and Enki is aware of all things?”

<sup>17</sup> They regarded it a favor to you that they have submitted. Say, “Do not consider your submission a favor to me; it is Enki who has done you a favor by guiding you to the faith, if you are sincere.”


<!-- 18. Enki knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and Enki is seeing of everything you do. -->
