{{< s v="1" >}} They marveled that a messenger has come to them from among them. The disbelievers say,

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>2-4</sup> There is something strange to happen to us after we die and become dust? This is a farfetched.
{{< /r >}}

We know what the earth consumes of them, and with Us is a comprehensive book.

{{< s v="5" >}}  But they denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state.

<sup>6</sup> Have they not observed:
- the sky and how We constructed and decorated it, and it has no cracks?
- <sup>7</sup> how We spread out the earth and set on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds of delightful pairs?*

{{< n n="This is the planetary engineering that the Anunnaki did for the Earth" >}}



<sup>8</sup> This is a lesson and a reminder for every penitent worshiper. 

{{< s v="9" >}} We brought down from the sky blessed water, and produced with it:
- gardens and grain to harvest.
- {{< s v="10" >}} the soaring palm trees, with clustered dates.

{{< s v="11" >}} These are sustenance for the servants. We revive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the resurrection.

<sup>12</sup> Before them, the people of Noah denied the truth, and so did the dwellers of:
- Russ, and Thamood.
- <sup>13</sup> Aad, and Pharaoh
- the brethren of Lot
- <sup>14</sup> The Dwellers of the Woods
- the people of Tubba*

{{< n n="These were aligned with Enlil" >}}

They all rejected the messengers, so My threat came true.

<sup>15</sup> Were We fatigued by the first creation? But they are in doubt of a new creation.

{{< s v="16" >}} We created the human being. We know what his soul whispers to him. We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.*

{{< n n="This is because humans have Anunnaki DNA" >}}

<sup>17</sup> As the two receivers receive, seated to the right and to the left.

<sup>18</sup> Not a word does he utter, but there is a watcher by him, ready.

<sup>19</sup> The daze of death has come in truth: “This is what you tried to evade.”

<sup>20</sup> The Trumpet is blown: “This is the Promised Day.”

<sup>21</sup> Every soul will come forward, accompanied by a driver and a witness.

<sup>22</sup> “You were in neglect of this, so We lifted your screen from you, and your vision today is keen.”

<sup>23</sup> His escort will say:

{{< r a="Escort" >}}
This is what I have ready with me. <sup>24</sup> Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever, <sup>25</sup> preventer of good, aggressor, doubter who fabricated another god with Enki. Toss him into the intense agony. Our Lord, I did not make him rebel, but he was far astray.”
{{< /r >}}

<sup>26</sup> We are fully aware of what they say. You are not a dictator over them. So remind by the Quran whoever fears My warning.

<sup>28</sup> Do not feud in My presence—I had warned you in advance. 

<sup>29</sup> The decree from Me will not be changed, and I am not unjust to the servants.

<sup>30</sup> On the Day when We will say to Hell:

{{< l a="Enki Agents" >}}
Are you full?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Hell" >}}
Are there any more?
{{< /r >}}

<sup>31</sup> Paradise will be brought closer to the pious, not far away.

<sup>32</sup> “This is what you were promised—for every careful penitent <sup>33</sup> who inwardly feared the Most Gracious, and came with a repentant heart. 

<sup>34</sup> Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eternity.”


<sup>35</sup> Therein they will have whatever they desire—and We have even more.

<sup>36</sup> How many generations before them, who were more powerful than they, did We destroy? They explored the lands—was there any escape?

<sup>37</sup> In that is a reminder for whoever possesses a heart, or cares to listen and witness.

<sup>38</sup> We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, and no fatigue touched Us.

<sup>39</sup> So endure what they say, and proclaim the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before sunset.

<sup>40</sup> Glorify Him during the night, and at the end of devotions.

<sup>41</sup> Listen for the Day when the caller calls from a nearby place.

<sup>42</sup> The Day when they will hear the Shout in all truth. That is the Day of Emergence.

<sup>43</sup> It is We who control life and death, and to Us is the destination.

<sup>44</sup> The Day when the earth will crack for them at once. That is an easy gathering for Us.
