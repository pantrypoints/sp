{{< s v="1-3" >}}  When the inevitable occurs, the low will be raised high. 

<sup>4-5</sup> The earth will be shaken with a shock. The mountains are crushed and crumbled.

<sup>6</sup> They become scattered dust. 

{{< s v="7" >}} And you become 3 classes.

<sup>8</sup> Those on the Right—what of those on the Right?

<sup>9-10</sup> Those on the Left—what of those on the Left? 

{{< s v="11" >}}  The forerunners are the nearest.

<sup>12</sup> The Gardens of Bliss with luxurious furnishings throng with the ancients and a small band of the latecomers.

<sup>15</sup> They recline on those furnishings, facing each other. 

The immortalized youth will serve them with:
- cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks causing them neither headache nor intoxication
- <sup>20</sup> fruits of their choice
- <sup>21</sup> meat of birds that they may desire.
- <sup>22</sup> lovely companions 23 like treasured pearls.

<sup>24</sup> These are reward for what they used to do.

<sup>25</sup> Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no accusations <sup>26</sup> only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”

<sup>27</sup> Those on the Right—what of those on the Right?

<sup>28</sup> In lush orchards sweet-smelling plants <sup>30</sup> extended shade <sup>31</sup> outpouring water,  <sup>32</sup> and abundant fruit, uplifted mattresses.

<sup>35</sup> We have created them of special creation and made them virgins that are tender and unaging for those on the Right, a throng from the ancients and a throng from the latecomers.

What of those on the Left?

<sup>45</sup> They had lived before that in luxury in immense wrongdoing.

<sup>47</sup> They used to say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
When we are dead, are we to be resurrected? And our ancient ancestors too?
{{< /r >}}

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
The first and the last will be gathered for the appointment of a familiar Day
{{< /l >}}

Then the misguided will <sup>52</sup> be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.

<sup>56</sup> That is their hospitality on the Day of Retribution.

<!-- <sup>57. We created you—if only you would believe! -->

<sup>58-59</sup> Did you create what you ejaculate? Or are We the Creator?

<!-- Have you seen 

59. Is it you who created it,  -->

<sup>60</sup> We have decreed death among you. We will not be outstripped <sup>61</sup> in replacing you with your likes, and transforming you into what you do not know.

<sup>62</sup> You have known the first formation; if only you would remember.

<sup>63</sup> Have you seen what you cultivate?

<sup>64</sup> Is it you who make it grow, or are We the Grower?

<sup>65</sup> If We will, We can turn it into rubble. Then you will lament.

<sup>66</sup> “We are penalized. No, we are being deprived.”

<sup>68-69</sup> Did you send from the sky the water that you drink? Or are We the Sender?

<sup>70</sup> If we want we can make is salty. Will you not be thankful?

<sup>77-78</sup> It is a noble Quran, a well-protected Book.

<sup>79</sup> Only the purified can grasp it, a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.

<sup>81</sup> Do you take this discourse so lightly and make it your livelihood to deny it?

<sup>83</sup> So when it has reached the throat.

<sup>84</sup> As you are looking on.

We are nearer to it than you are, but you do not see.

<sup>86</sup> If you are not held to account.
