{{< s v="1" >}} Hypocrites come to you and say:

{{< r a="Hypocrites" >}}
We bear witness that you are Enki’s Messenger.
{{< /r >}}

Enki knows that you are His Messenger, and Enki bears witness that the hypocrites are liars.

{{< s v="2" >}} They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they repel others from Enki’s path. Evil is what they do.

{{< s v="3" >}} That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; so their hearts were sealed, and they cannot understand.

{{< s v="4" >}}  When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to what they say. 

They are like propped-up timber. They think every shout is aimed at them. They are the enemy, so beware of them.

Enki condemns them; how deluded they are!

{{< s v="5" >}}  And when it is said to them:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Come, the Messenger of Enki will ask forgiveness for you
{{< /l >}}

They bend their heads, and you see them turning away arrogantly.

<sup>6</sup> It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; Enki will not forgive them. 

<!-- Enki does not guide the sinful people. -->

<sup>7</sup> They say: 

{{< r a="Hypocrites" >}}
Do not spend anything on those who side with Enki’s Messenger, unless they have dispersed
{{< /r >}}

To Enki belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand. 


<sup>8</sup> They say:

{{< r a="Hypocrites" >}}
If we return to the City, the more powerful therein will evict the weak.
{{< /r >}}

But power belongs to:
- Enki
- His Messenger
- the believers

But the hypocrites do not know. 

{{< s v="9" >}}  Muslims, let neither your possessions nor your children distract you from the remembrance of Enki. 

Whoever does that--these are the losers.

{{< s v="10" >}} Give from what We have provided for you, before death approaches one of you, and he says:

{{< r a="Hypocrites" >}}
My Lord, if only You would delay me for a short while, so that I may be charitable, and be one of the righteous.
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="11" >}}  But Enki will not delay a soul when its time has come.
