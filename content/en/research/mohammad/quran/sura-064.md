Everything in the heavens and the earth praises Enki. To Him belongs the Kingdom, and to Him all praise is due, and He is  Able to do all things. 


{{< s v="2" >}}  It is He who created you. Some of you are unbelievers, and some of you are believers.

Enki perceives what you do.

{{< s v="3" >}} He created the heavens and the earth with truth. He designed you, and designed you well, and to Him is the final return.

{{< s v="4" >}} He knows everything in the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. 

Enki knows what is within the hearts. {{< s v="5" >}}  Has the news not reached you, of those who disbelieved before? 

They tasted the ill consequences of their conduct, and a painful torment awaits them.

{{< s v="6" >}} That is because their messengers came to them with clear explanations, but they said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Are human beings going to guide us?
{{< /r >}}


So they disbelieved and turned away. But Enki is in no need. Enki is Independent and Praiseworthy.

<sup>7-8</sup> Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Yes, by my Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be informed of everything you did; and that is easy for Enki.
{{< /l >}}

<!-- 8. So believe in Enki and His Messenger, and the Light which We sent down.  -->

{{< s v="9" >}} The Day when He gathers you for the Day of Gathering—that is the Day of Mutual Exchange. 

Whoever believes in Enki and acts with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, and will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever.

That is the supreme achievement. 

{{< s v="10" >}} Those who disbelieve are the inmates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever. What a miserable fate!

{{< s v="11-13" >}}  No disaster occurs except by Enki’s leave. Whoever believes in Enki, He guides his heart.

<!-- 12. So obey Enki, and obey the Messenger. But
if you turn away—it is only incumbent on
Our Messenger to deliver the clear message. -->

<!-- 13. Enki, there is no god but He; and in Enki
let the believers put their trust. -->

<sup>14</sup> Among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. 

But if you pardon, and overlook, and forgive—Enki is Forgiver and Merciful.

<sup>15</sup> Your possessions and your children are a test, but with Enki is a splendid reward.

{{< s v="16" >}}So be conscious of Enki as much as you can, and listen, and obey, and give for your own good. He who is protected from his stinginess—these are the prosperous.

<sup>17</sup> If you lend Enki a good loan, He will multiply it for you, and will forgive you. Enki is Appreciative and Forbearing.

<!-- 18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen,
the Almighty, the Wise.
