{{< s v="1" >}}  O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity, and calculate their term.

Be pious. Do not evict them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven adultery. 

These are the limits of Enki. 
- Whoever oversteps Enki’s limits has wronged his own soul.

You never know. Enki may afterwards bring about a new situation.


{{< s v="2" >}}  Once they have reached their term, either retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably.

Call to witness 2 just people from among you, and give upright testimony for Enki. 

By that is exhorted whoever believes in Enki and the Last Day. 

Whoever fears Enki—He will make a way out for him.

{{< s v="3" >}}  And will provide for him from where he never expected. Whoever relies on Enki—He will suffice him. Enki will accomplish His purpose.

Enki has set a measure to all things.

{{< s v="4" >}}  As for those of your women who have reached menopause, if you have any doubts, their term shall be 3 months—and also for those who have not menstruated. 

As for those who are pregnant, their term shall be until they have delivered. 

Whoever fears Enki—He will make things easy for him.

{{< s v="5" >}}  This is the ordinance of Enki, which He sent down to you. 

Whoever fears Enki—He will remit his sins, and will amplify his reward.

<sup>6</sup> Allow them to reside where you reside, according to your means. Do not harass them or make things difficult for them.

If they are pregnant, spend on them until they give birth. 

If they nurse your infant, give them their payment. 

Conduct your relation in amity. 

But if you disagree, then let another woman nurse him. 


<sup>7</sup> The wealthy shall spend according to his means.

He whose resources are restricted shall spend according to what Enki has given him.

Enki never burdens a soul beyond what He has given it. 

Enki will bring ease after hardship.


<sup>8</sup> How many a town defied the command of its Lord and His messengers? So We held it strictly accountable, and We punished it with a dreadful punishment.

{{< s v="9" >}}  It tasted the result of its decisions, and the outcome of its decisions was perdition.

{{< s v="10" >}}  Enki has prepared for them a severe retribution. 

So beware of Enki, O you who possess intellect and have faith. 

Enki has sent down to you a Reminder.

{{< s v="11" >}}  A messenger who recites to you Enki’s Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring those who believe and work righteousness from darkness into light. 

Whoever believes in Enki and acts with integrity, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide forever. 

Enki has given him an excellent provision.

<sup>12</sup> Enki is He Who created seven heavens, and their like of earth. 

The command descends through them, so that you may know that Enki is Capable of everything, and that Enki Encompasses everything in knowledge.
