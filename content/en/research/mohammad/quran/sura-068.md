{{< s v="1" >}}  Noon. By the pen, and by what they inscribe.

{{< s v="2" >}}  Mohammad, you are not insane.

{{< s v="3" >}}  In fact, you will have a reward that will never end.

{{< s v="4" >}}  You are of a great moral character.
- {{< s v="5-6" >}}  You will see, and they will see which of you is afflicted by the devil.

{{< s v="7">}} Your Lord knows best:
- who has strayed from His path, and
- who is the well-guided.

{{< s v="8">}} So do not obey the deniers.
- {{< s v="9" >}}  They would like you to compromise, so that they would compromise too.

{{< s v="10" >}}  Do not obey:
- any vile swearer.
- {{< s v="11" >}} the backbiter, spreader of slander
- {{< s v="12">}} the cruel, illegitimate pretender

{{< s v="14" >}} Just because he has money and children, he says that Our Verses are “Myths of the ancients!” {{< s v="16" >}} We will brand him on his snout. 

{{< s v="17-18" >}} We have tried them as We tried the companions of the garden, when they swore to cut its fruit in the [early] morning without any reservation.

{{< s v="19" >}} This is why a calamity from your Lord came upon the garden while they slept. <sup>20</sup> In the morning it was as if picked.

<sup>21-22</sup> In the morning, they called to one another:

{{< r a="People" >}}
Go early to your plantation, if you are going to harvest.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>23</sup> So off they went, murmuring to one another.

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>24</sup> No poor person is to enter it upon you today.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>25</sup> So they went early.

<sup>26</sup> But when they saw it, they said::

{{< r a="People" >}}
We were wrong. 27. We are now deprived.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>28</sup> The most reasonable of them said:

{{< l a="Someone" >}}
Did I not say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’
{{< /l>}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>29</sup> Glory to our Lord! We were indeed in the wrong.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>30</sup> Then they turned to one another, blaming one another.

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>31</sup> Woe to us—we were domineering. 32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better substitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>33</sup> Such is the punishment. But the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.

<sup>34</sup> For the righteous are Gardens of Delight with their Lord.

<sup>35</sup> Shall We treat the Muslims like the villains?

<sup>36</sup> What's the matter with you [Mohammad]? How do you judge?

<sup>37</sup> Do you have a scripture which you study 38. Wherein there is whatever you choose?

<sup>39</sup> Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand?

<sup>40</sup> Ask them, which of them will guarantee that.

<sup>41</sup> Do they have partners? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful.

<sup>42</sup> On the Day when the Shin will be exposed. They will be called to bow down, but they will be unable.

<sup>43</sup> Their eyes subdued, shame will cover them. They were invited to bow down when they were sound.

<sup>44</sup> So leave Me to those who reject this discourse. We will proceed against them gradually, from where they do not know.
 
<sup>45</sup> I will give them respite. My plan is firm.

<sup>46</sup> Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are burdened with debt?

<sup>47</sup> Or do they know the future, and so they write it down?

<sup>48</sup> So wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish who cried out in despair.

<sup>49</sup> Were it not for his Lord’s favor that reached him, he would have been thrown into the wilderness, fully despised.

<sup>50</sup> But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous.

<sup>51</sup> Those who disbelieve almost stab you with their glances when they hear the message and say “He [Prophet Mohammad] is crazy!”

<sup>52</sup> But it is no less than a reminder to all the Worlds.
