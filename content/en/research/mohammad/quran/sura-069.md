{{< s v="2" >}}  What is the Inevitable Reality?

{{< s v="4" >}} The Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe.
- {{< s v="5" >}} The Thamood were annihilated by the Overwhelming.
- {{< s v="6" >}} The Aad were annihilated by a furious, roaring wind.

{{< s v="7" >}} Enki unleashed it on them for 7 nights and 8 days, in succession. You could see the people tossed around, as though they were stumps of hollow palm-trees.

{{< s v="8" >}} Can you see any remnant of them?

{{< s v="9" >}} Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, and the Overturned Cities steeped in sin. 

{{< s v="10" >}} They disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an overpowering grip.

{{< s v="11-12" >}}  When the waters overflowed, We carried you in the cruising ship to remind you and make you remember it.

{{< s v="13-17" >}}
The Event will happen when:
- the Trumpet is sounded a single time.
- the earth and the mountains are lifted up, and crushed with a single crush.
- the heaven will crack so on that Day it will be frail.
- the angels will be ranged around its borders, while 8 will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day. 

{{< s v="18-20" >}} On that Day you will be exposed, and no secret of yours will remain hidden. 
- Those who believe will be given his record in their right hand and say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Here, read my record! I was certain that I would be meeting my account.
{{< /l >}}

{{< s v="21-24" >}} They will be in a pleasant life in an elevated garden, with low-hanging fruits. 

They will be told: 

{{< r a="Enki Agents" >}}
Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put done in the past.
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="25-" >}} But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he will say:

{{< r a="Sinner" >}}
I wish I was never given my book. And never knew what my account was. I wish that there were no eternity. My money and worldly power are gone. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Take him and shackle him. Then burn him in the Blaze. Then tie him up in a chain 70 cubits long. 
{{< /l >}}

He did not:
- believe in Enki
- feed the poor

He does not have any friend here today.
- His food is the pus from his wounds. This is the food for sinners. 


{{< s v="40-52" >}} The Quran is the speech of a noble messenger, not of a poet or a soothsayer. 
- It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
- If the Prophet Muhammad had made up some false statements about Us, We would have cut his from the aorta causing immediate death. 
- The Quran is a reminder for the righteous.
