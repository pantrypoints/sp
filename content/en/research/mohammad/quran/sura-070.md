{{< s v="1" >}}  Someone asked about the imminent torment. 

The disbelievers cannot repel it.

<!-- Enki, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. -->
The angels and the Spirit ascend to Enki on a Day lasting 50,000 years. {{< s v="4" >}} So be graciously patient. 

<sup>6</sup> They see it not coming soon. But We see it as coming very soon. 

<sup>8</sup> On that Day:
- the sky will be like molten brass.{{< s v="9" >}} 
- the mountains will be like tufted wool.{{< s v="10" >}}  
- No friend will care about his friend. They will be shown each other.
- The criminal will wish that he could be redeemed from the punishment by:
  - his children.
  - spouse
  - his brother.
  - his family that sheltered him.
  - everyone on earth


But no! It will be a Raging Fire that will burn them. It is meant for those who have hoarded wealth. 


{{< s v="19" >}} Mankind was created to be anxious about wealth. 
- He is impatient with it when evil touches him. 
- He withholds it when good touches him. 

This does not afflict those who:
- are constant in their prayer
- are meant to receive rightful donations, such as:
  - the beggars and the deprived.
- affirm the Day of Judgment.
- fear the punishment of their Lord.

No one is safe from their Lord’s punishment except for:
- the wives or female slaves who guard their chastity.
  - But whoever seeks to go beyond that are the transgressors.
- those who honor their trusts and their pledges.
- those who stand by their testimonies.

<sup>35</sup> These will be honored in Gardens.

<sup>37</sup> The disbelievers mocked the Prophet Mohammad saying that they will enter paradise before the believers do. 

<sup>38</sup> They think they will be admitted into the Garden of Bliss. 

<sup>39</sup> No! They will be replaced with people better than they. 

<sup>42</sup> So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day. 

<!-- 43. The Day when they will emerge from the
tombs in a rush, as though they were hurry-
ing towards a target.
44. Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by hu-
miliation. This is the Day which they were
promised.
