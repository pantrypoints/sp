{{< s v="1-2" >}} We sent Noah to his people: 

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Warn your people before the painful punishment comes.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Noah" >}}
O my people, I am to you a clear warner. Worship Enki and obey me. He will forgive you of your sins, and reprieve you until a stated term. Enki’s term cannot be deferred once it has arrived.

My Lord, I have called my people night and day. But my call added only to their flight.

Whenever I called them to Your forgiveness, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrapped themselves in their garments, and insisted, and became more and more arrogant.

I called them openly. Then I appealed to them publicly. Then I spoke to them privately telling them to ask You for forgiveness for He will let loose torrents on you. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="14" >}} Enki created you in stages. He created 7 heavens in layers.*

{{< n n="This is the 7 Chakras which we assign to be part of the 5 Strata or Layers" >}}

{{< s v="16" >}} He set the moon in their midst for light, and He made the sun a lamp.

{{< s v="17" >}} Enki germinated you from the earth like plants.

{{< s v="18" >}} Then He will return you into it, and will bring you out again.

12. And provide you with wealth and children, and allot for you gardens, and allot for you
rivers.

Enki made the earth large for you to travel its diverse roads.

Noah said:

{{< r a="Noah" >}}
My Lord, they have defied me, and followed him whose wealth and children increase him only in perdition.

They schemed against me, saying: “Do not give up your gods; do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr.

They have misled many, so do not increase the wrongdoers except in confusion.
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="25" >}} Because of their wrongs, they were drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. 

{{< s v="26" >}} Noah said:

{{< r a="Noah" >}}
My Lord, do not leave a single unbeliever alive. If You leave them, they will mislead your servants, and will breed only wicked unbelievers.

Forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home in faith, and all the believing men and believing women; and do not increase the wrongdoers except in perdition.”
