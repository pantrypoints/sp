{{< s v="4" >}}  Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmically.

{{< s v="5" >}}  We are about to give you a heavy message.

<sup>6</sup> The vigil of night is more effective, and better suited for recitation.

<sup>7</sup> In the daytime, you have lengthy work to do.

<!-- 8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. -->

{{< s v="9" >}} He is the  Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.

{{< s v="10" >}} Endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely.

Enki designed the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you.

<!-- So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking Enki’s bounty; and others fighting in Enki’s cause. So read of it what is possible for you, and observe the prayers, and
give regular charity, and lend Enki a generous loan. -->

<!-- Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with Enki, better
and generously rewarded. And seek Enki’s
forgiveness, for Enki is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful. -->
