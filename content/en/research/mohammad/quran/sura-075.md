I swear by:
- the Day of Resurrection.
- the blaming soul.

Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones?

{{< s v="4" >}}  Yes, We are Able to reconstruct his fingertips.

{{< s v="5" >}}  But man wants to deny what is ahead of him.

{{< r a="Man" >}}
<sup>6</sup> When is the Day of Resurrection?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>7</sup> When vision is dazzled.

<sup>8</sup> The moon is eclipsed.

The sun and the moon are joined together. {{< s v="10" >}}  On that Day, man will say:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Where is the escape?
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="11" >}}  None! There is no refuge.

<sup>12</sup> To your Lord on that Day is the settlement.

<sup>13</sup> On that Day man will be informed of everything he put forward, and everything he left behind.

<sup>14</sup> Man will be evidence against himself <sup>15</sup> even as he presents his excuses.

{{< s v="16" >}} Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry on with it.

<sup>17</sup> Upon Us is its collection and its recitation. <sup>18</sup> Then, when We have recited it, follow its recitation.

<sup>19</sup> Then upon Us is its explanation.

<sup>20</sup> Alas, you love the fleeting life <sup>21</sup> and disregard the Hereafter.

<sup>22</sup> Faces on that Day will be radiant <sup>23</sup> looking towards their Lord.

<sup>24</sup> Faces on that Day will be gloomy 25. realizing that a back-breaker has befallen them 26. when it has reached the breastbones.

<sup>27</sup> And it is said, “Who is the healer?”

<sup>28</sup> And He realizes that it is the parting.

<sup>29</sup> And leg is entwined with leg.

<sup>30</sup> To your Lord on that Day is the drive.

<sup>31</sup> He neither believed nor prayed.

<sup>32</sup> But he denied and turned away.

<sup>33</sup> Then he went to his family, full of pride.

<sup>36</sup> Does man think that he will be left without purpose?

<sup>37</sup> Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen?

<sup>38</sup> Then he became a clot. He created and proportioned? <sup>39</sup> and made of him the two sexes, the male and the female?

<sup>40</sup> Is He not Able to revive the dead?
