[The Prophet Mohammad was trying to spread Islam to an influential member of the Quraysh]

Abdullah, the son of Umm Makt´m asked him: "How do you know that he would be purified? He thinks he does not need Islam. Do not blame yourself if he will not be purified."

The Prophet Mohammad frowned and turned away.

But to those who came to you striving for knowledge, you were inattentive. 

These verses are a reminder. 

<sup>12</sup> So whoever wills may remember it.

<sup>13-16</sup> [It is recorded] in honored sheets, exalted and purified, [carried] by the hands of messenger-agents, noble and dutiful. 

<sup>17</sup>  Cursed is disbelieving man.

<!-- 1725ÔAbdullŒh, the son of Umm Makt´m. -->

<sup>18</sup> From what substance did Enki create him?

<sup>19</sup>  From a sperm-drop. 

<sup>20-21</sup> Then He eased the way for man and causes his death and provides a grave for him.

<sup>22</sup> Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.

<sup>23</sup> But No! Man has not yet accomplished what Enki commanded him.

<sup>24</sup> Then let mankind look at his food

<sup>25</sup> How We poured down water in torrents,

<sup>26</sup> Then We broke open the earth and caused:
- <sup>27</sup> grain to grow
- <sup>28</sup> grapes and herbage
- <sup>29</sup>  olive and palm trees
- <sup>30</sup> gardens of dense shrubbery
- <sup>31</sup> fruit and grass
- <sup>32</sup> as enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock.

<sup>33-36</sup> But when there comes the Deafening Blast, man will flee from his brother, mother and father, his consort and his children

<sup>37</sup> For every man, on that Day, will be a matter adequate for him.

<sup>38-39</sup> Some faces, that Day, will be bright, laughing, rejoicing at good news.

<sup>40-41</sup> Other faces, that Day, will have on them dust, covered by blackness

<sup>42</sup> Those are the disbelievers, the wicked ones.
