{{< s v="1-3" >}} The defrauders are those who take a full measure from people. 
- But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat.
- Woe to them!

{{< s v="7" >}} The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen, a numerical book.

<sup>13</sup> When our Our revelations are recited to the sinful aggressor, he says, “Legends of the ancients.”
- Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to earn.

{{< s v="15" >}} On that Day:
- they will roast in Hell.
- It will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”

{{< s v="18-20" >}} The record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen, a numerical book.

<sup>21</sup> It is witnessed by those brought near.

<sup>22</sup> The righteous will be amid bliss 23. on thrones, looking on.

<sup>24</sup> You will recognize on their faces the radiance of bliss.

<sup>25</sup> They will be given to drink a sealed wine with a musk as a seal—this is what competitors should compete for.

<sup>27</sup> Its mixture is of Tasneem, <sup>28</sup> a spring from which those brought near drink.

<sup>29</sup> Those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.

<sup>30</sup> And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another.

<sup>31</sup> And when they went back to their families, they would go back exulting.

<sup>32</sup> And if they saw them, they would say, “These people are lost.”

<sup>33</sup> Yet they were not sent as guardians over them.

<sup>34</sup> But on that Day, those who believed will laugh at the unbelievers.

<sup>35</sup> On luxurious furnishings, looking on. 

<sup>36</sup> Have the unbelievers been repaid for what they used to do?
