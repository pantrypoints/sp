{{< s v="1" >}}  By the sky and the nightly visitor which is the star which has a light that pierces through the darkness. 

{{< s v="4" >}}  There is no soul without a Protector over it.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Let man consider what he was created from.
- {{< s v="6-7" >}} He was created from gushing liquid, coming from between the backbone and the breastbones.

{{< s v="8" >}} Enki is certainly able to return him to life.

{{< s v="9" >}} On the Day when the secrets are disclosed, {{< s v="10" >}} man will have no strength, and no supporter.

{{< s v="11" >}} By the sky that rains and the earth that cracks open, that Day is decisive and is not a joke. 

{{< s v="15" >}} They are preparing a plan, but I am also preparing a plan. 

{{< s v="17" >}} Therefore, give the blasphemers some time. Do not be in haste for revenge, for you will see what will become of
them.



## 87. The Most High (al-a’la)

{{< s v="2" >}}  Enki creates and regulates, {{< s v="3" >}} measures and guides {{< s v="4" >}} produces the pasture.{{< s v="5" >}} then turns it into light debris.

<sup>6</sup> We will make you read, so do not forget.

<sup>7</sup> Except what Enki wills. He knows what is declared, and what is hidden.

<sup>8</sup> We will ease you into the Easy Way.

{{< s v="9" >}}  So remind, if reminding helps. 

{{< s v="10" >}}  The reverent will remember.

{{< s v="11-13" >}}  But the wretched will avoid it.
- He will enter the Gigantic Fire where he will neither die, nor live.

{{< s v="14-15" >}} Successful is he who:
- purifies himself
- mentions the name of his Lord, and
- prays. 

{{< s v="16-18" >}} But you prefer the worldly life even if the Hereafter is better, and more lasting. This is in the former scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
