{{< s v="1" >}} Have you heard of the news of the overwhelming?

{{< s v="2-5" >}} On that Day,
- faces will be shamed, laboring and exhausted, roasting in a scorching Fire, given  to drink from a flaming spring.

<sup>6-7</sup> They will have no food except thorns that neither nourishes, nor satisfies hunger.

<sup>8</sup> Faces on that Day will be joyful, satisfied with their endeavor.

{{< s v="9" >}}  In a lofty Garden, you will hear no nonsense.

<sup>12</sup> In it is a flowing spring, <sup>13</sup> there are raised beds, <sup>14</sup> cups set in place, <sup>15</sup> cushions are set in rows, <sup>16</sup> carpets spread around.

<sup>17</sup> Do they not look at:
- the camels—how they are created?
- <sup>18</sup> how the sky is raised? 
- <sup>19</sup> how the mountains are installed?
- <sup>20</sup> how the earth is spread out?

<sup>22</sup> You have no control over them.


## 89. The Dawn (al-Fajr)

{{< s v="1" >}}  By:
- the daybreak
- 10 nights
- the even and odd number
- the passing night.

Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Aad?

The people of Iram had lofty pillars, the likes of which had never been created in the land. 

{{< s v="9" >}} The Thamood carved the rocks in the valley and the Pharaoh had Stakes.

They all oppressed the lands and increased the corruption in it. 

So your Lord poured down upon them a scourge of punishment.

When the Lord tries humans and is generous to him and favors him, he says  “My Lord has honored me”.

{{< s v="16" >}} But whenever He tests him, and restricts his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.

<sup>17</sup> No! But you:
- do not honor Muhammad  <!-- the orphan. -->
- do not urge the feeding of the poor
- devour inheritance with all greed. 
- love wealth immensely. 

<sup>21</sup> No! When the earth is leveled, pounded, and crushed, and your Lord comes, with the angels, row after row.

<sup>23</sup> On that Day:
- Hell is brought forward.
- man will remember, but how?

<sup>24</sup> He will say:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
If only I had forwarded for my life.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- 25. On that Day, none will punish as He punishes. 
    
15. An orphan near of kin.

to your Lord, pleased and accepted. 
among My servants.
30. Enter My Paradise.
