By the morning brightness <sup>2</sup> and by the night when it covers with darkness.

<sup>3</sup> Your Lord has not taken leave of you, O Muhammad, nor has He detested you.

<sup>4</sup> The Hereafter is better for you than the first life.

<sup>5</sup> Your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.

<sup>6</sup> Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?

<sup>7</sup> He found you:
- lost and guided you
- <sup>8</sup> poor and made you self-sufficient

<sup>9</sup> So as for the orphan, do not oppress him.

<sup>10</sup> As for the petitioner, do not repel him.

<sup>11</sup> But as for the favor of your Lord, report it.


## 94. The Soothing (ash-Sharh)

Oh Mohammad, we:
- expanded your breast for you, 
- removed from you your burden
- raised your reputation high.

With hardship comes relief. Your hardship ease, so that when you have finished your duties, then stand up for worship and to your Lord direct our longing.



## 95. The Fig (at-Tin)

By:
- {{< s v="1" >}} the fig and the olive
- {{< s v="2" >}} Mount Sinai 
- {{< s v="3" >}} this secure city [i.e., Makkah]

{{< s v="4" >}} We have certainly created man in the best of stature, then returned him to the lowest of the low, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have a reward uninterrupted.

Why do you still deny the Recompense?
