Your Lord created man from a clinging substance.

<!-- 3. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous –
4. Who taught by the pen –
5. Taught man that which he knew not. -->

<sup>6</sup> Man transgresses because he sees himself self-sufficient.

<sup>8</sup> To your Lord is the return.

<sup>9</sup> Have you seen the one who forbids

<sup>10</sup> A servant when he prays?

<sup>11</sup> Have you seen if he is upon guidance <sup>12</sup> or enjoins righteousness?

<sup>13</sup> Have you seen if he denies and turns away –

<sup>14</sup> Does he not know that Enki sees?

<sup>15</sup> No! If he does not desist, We will surely drag him by the forelock 

<sup>16</sup> A lying, sinning forelock.

<sup>17</sup> Then let him call his associates;

<sup>18</sup> We will call the angels of Hell.

<sup>19</sup> No! Do not obey him. But prostrate and draw near [to Enki].
