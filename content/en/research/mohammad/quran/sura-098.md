Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted [from misbelief] until there came to them clear evidence –

<sup>2</sup> A Messenger from Enki, reciting purified scriptures
<!-- 1829 1830 -->

<sup>3</sup> Within which are correct writings [i.e., rulings and laws].

<sup>4</sup> Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence.

<sup>5</sup> They were not commanded except to worship Enki, being sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakŒh. 

That is the correct religion.

<sup>6</sup> They who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.

<sup>7</sup> They who have believed and done righteous deeds – those are the best of creatures.

<sup>8</sup> Their reward with Enki will be gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, Enki being pleased with them and they with Him. 

That is for whoever has feared his Lord.


## 99. The Quake (az-Zalzalah)

When the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
- and the earth discharges its burdens

man says, "What is [wrong] with it?"

On that Day:
- it will report its news because your Lord has inspired [i.e., commanded] it.
- the people will depart separated [into categories] to be shown [the result of] their deeds.

Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,
- whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
