<!-- It is not my intent to excuse or extenuate any the least excess or evil in the Commonwealth, but rather highly to approve and commend that which by others hath been spoken and written against such abuses.
Yet in this discourse of Treasure, as I have already set down affirmatively, which are the true causes that may either augment or decrease the same= 
so is it not impertinent to continue my negative declarations of those enormities and actions which cannot work these effects as some men have supposed.

For in redress of this important business,  -->

If we mistake the nature of the disease, then we will not be able to have cures. 

People want to to turn lending into charity and make the Rich lend to the poor freely because it would please God, and be profitable to the Commonwealth. What is the proof that trade decreases as interest rates increase?

It is true that some men overtrade. They buy Lands or lend their Money when they are grown rich, old, or some other occasion at high interest. This lets the rich give opportunity to the younger & poorer Merchants to rise in the world, and enlarge their dealings. It does not follow that trade must lessen as consequence.  

<!-- ; to the performance whereof, if they want means of their own, they may, and do,take it up at interest=  so that our money lies not dead, it is still traded. -->
Many Merchants and Shop-keepers have begun with nothing of their own. Yet they have grown very rich by trading with other men's money. When the economy is good, experienced credit-worthy people can borrow at high interest. Their diligence increases the affairs of the Commonwealth. The use the money of Widows, Orphans, Lawyers, Gentlemen and others for Foreign Trade

<!-- do we not know, that when trading is quick and good, many men, by means of their experience, and having credit to take up money at interest, do trade for much more than they are worth of their own stock?  -->

<!-- by which diligence of the industrious, the  are increased, 

, which themselves have no skill to perform. We find at this present, that notwithstanding the Poverty we are fallen into by the Excesses and Losses of late times, yet that  -->

Many men have much money in their chests and do not know how to use it. But Merchants will not borrow it even at low interest if the economy is not doing good. 

Thus, we prove on the contrary that Trade and interest rates rise and fall together. 


<!--  take the same at interest (although at low rates) in regard there is a stop of trade in Spain and in France, whereby he cannot employ his own meanes, much lesse other mens moneys. -->

So that for these, and some other reasons which might be alledged, we might conclude, contrary to those who affirm, that , for they rise and fall together. In the next place, we hear 

Our Lawyers are much condemned for the many lawsuits they create which exceed all the other Christian Kingdoms. But is this from= 
- the covetousness of lawyers, or
- the people's perverseness?

<!-- And let this be as it may, I will enquire no farther therein than our present discourse doth require, concerning the decay of our Trade, and impoverishing of the Kingdom. -->

Lawsuits make many people poor and penniless. But I cannot conceive how lawsuits reduce trade, because one man's loss is another's victory. 

<!--  should make us trade for less by one single penny, I cannot well conceive. For although amongst the great number of them who are vexed and undone by controversies, there be ever some Merchants; yet we know, that one mans necessity becomes another mans opportunity.
 -->

Our trade has never decayed from a lack of Merchants or Means to employ us. Instead, trade decays from excessive imports or reduced exports caused by wars or some peacetime changes mentioned in Chapter 3.

Lawyers are necessary for all. Their Cases, Quillets, Delayes and Charges, are mischievous to many. These things indeed are cancers in the Estates of particular men, but not of the Commonwealth, for one man's loss becomes another mans gain.

Lastly, we should not become so frugal as to not import, because it would also reduce our exports. What will become of our Ships, Mariners, Munitions, our poor Artificers, and many others? Will other Countries give us money for our goods, without buying theirs? 

It would be better to run a middle course by spending moderately, which will purchase treasure plentifully.

The pomp of Buildings, Apparel, etc in the Nobility, Gentry, and other able persons, cannot impoverish the Kingdom if it is done with costly works on our Materials and by our own people. It will maintain the poor with the purse of the rich, which is the best distribution of the Commonwealth.

But I agree that the Fishing industry would be a better employment, and far more profitable. In big business there is means enough to employ both rich and poor. <!-- , whereof there hath been much said and written; It resteth only that something might be as well effected for the honor and wealth, both of the King and his Kingdoms.
