As a summary, the rule in our forraign trade is that:
- our coin is undervalued in the foreign exchange in a country where our exports are less than the value of our imports from that country
- our coin is overvalued in the foreign exchange in a country where our exports are more than the value of our imports from that country

The foreign exchange for trade financing has a high, at par, or low rate. This is not directly affected by= 
- the central banks debasing their coins nor by adding seignorage
- the Statute for employments by foreigners
- the money markets and trade financing
- fiscal or monetary policies

<!-- taxation  meer Exchanger do his worst; Let Princes
oppress, Lawyers extort, Usurers bit, Prodigals wast, and lastly let Merchants
carry out what mony they shall have occasion to use in traffique.  -->

<!-- Yet all these actions can work no other effects in the course of trade than is declared in this
discourse.  -->

In reality, wealth can only be brought in or carried out through Foreign Trade depending on the over or under balance in value of imports to exports.

This balance must be the focus of the government. Other things are fruitless but also hurtful.

<!-- And this must come to pass by a Necessity beyond all resistance. So that all
other courses (which tend not to this end) howsoever they may seem to force
mony into a Kingdom for a time, yet are they (in the end) not only   -->

<!-- they are like to violent flouds which bear down their banks, and
suddenly remain dry again for want of waters.
Behold then the true form and worth of forraign Trade, which is, The great
Revenue of the King, The honour of the Kingdom, The Noble profession of the
Merchant, The School of our Arts, The supply of our wants, The employment
of our poor, The improvement of our Lands, The Nurcery of our Mariners, The
walls of the Kingdoms, 
 -->
<!-- The means of our Treasure, The Sinnews of our wars,
The terror of our Enemies. For all which great and weighty reasons, do so
many well governed States highly countenance the profession, and carefully
cherish the action, not only with Policy to encrease it, but also with power to
protect it from all forraign injuries=  because they know it is a Principal in
Reason of State to maintain and defend that which doth Support them and their
estates. -->
