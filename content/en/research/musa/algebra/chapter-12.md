Suppose that a man on his death-bed were to free 2 slaves. The man has a son and a daughter. 

One slave dies, leaving a daughter and property to a greater amount than his price.*

You take 2/3 of his price, and what the other slave has to return (in order to complete hisransom).

If the slave dies before the master dies, then the master's son receives as much as the 2 daughters together.

But if the slave dies before the master, then you take 2/3 of his value and what is returned by the other slave. You then distribute it between the master's son and daughter. 


the property of the slave,
ducted and paid to the master's
who
dies, is to
be de-
heirs, first, two-thirds
of
the original cost of that slave, and secondly what is wanting
to complete the ransom of the other slave. Call the amount

such a manner, that the son receives twice as
the daughter
;
and what then remains (from the
tage of the slave)
is
heri-
for the son alone, exclusive of the
daughter; for the moiety of the heritage of the slave
descends to the daughter of the slave, and the other
moiety, according to the law of succession, to the son
of the master, and there
is
nothing for the daughter (of
the master).
It
is
the same, if a
a slave, besides

whom
his
death-bed emancipates
he has no
capital,
and then the
slave dies before his master.
If a
whom
man in his illness emancipates a slave, besides
he possesses nothing, then that slave must ran-
som himself by
two-thirds of his price. If the master has
anticipated these two-thirds of his price and has spent
them, then, upon the death of the master, the slave
must pay two-thirds of what he retains.* But if the
master has anticipated from him his whole price and
spent
it,
then there
is
no claim against the
slave, since
he has already paid his entire price.
"
Suppose that a man on his death-bed emancipates
a slave, whose price is three hundred dirhems, not
having any property besides ; then the slave
dies, leav-
