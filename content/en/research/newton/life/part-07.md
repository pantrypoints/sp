Newton wrote the Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scriptures in a Letter to a Friend. 

This Treatise was first accurately published in Dr. Horsley's edition of his works. It has 2 texts:

1. 1 Epistle of St. John v. 7
2. 1 Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy iii. 16. 

This work deprived the advocates of the doctrine of the Trinity of two leading texts, Newton has been looked upon as an Arian.

But there is absolutely nothing in his writings to warrant such a conclusion.

His remaining theological works consist of:
- the Lexicon Propheticum which was left incomplete
- a Latin Dissertation on the sacred cubit of the Jews
  - This was translated into English and published in 1737 among the Miscellaneous Works of John Greaves 
- Four Letters addressed to Dr. Bentley, containing some arguments in proof of a Deity

<!-- The best faculties and the profoundest acquirements of our author are convincingly manifest in these lucid and powerful compositions.  -->

These were published in 1756, and reviewed by Dr. Samuel Johnson.

<!-- Newton's religious writings are distinguished by their absolute freedom from prejudice. Everywhere, throughout them, there glows the genuine nobleness of soul. To his whole life, indeed, we may here fitly extend the same observation. He was most richly imbued with the very spirit of the Scriptures which he so delighted to study and to meditate upon. His was a piety, so fervent, so sincere and practical, that it rose up like a holy incense from every thought and act. His a benevolence that not only willed, but endeavoured the best for all. His a philanthropy that held in the embracings of its love every brother-man. His a toleration of the largest and the truest; condemning persecution in every, even its mildest form; and kindly encouraging each striving after excellence:—a toleration that came not of indifference for the immoral and the impious met with their quick rebuke—but a toleration that came of the wise humbleness and the Christian charity, which see, in the nothingness of self and the almightiness of Truth, no praise for the ablest, and no blame for the feeblest in their strugglings upward to light and life.

In the winter of 1691-2, on returning from chapel, one morning, Newton found that a favourite little dog, called Diamond, had overturned a lighted taper on his desk, and that several papers containing the results of certain optical experiments, were nearly consumed. His only exclamation, on perceiving his loss, was, "Oh Diamond, Diamond, little knowest thou the mischief thou hast done" Dr. Brewster, in his life of our author, gives the following extract from the manuscript Diary of Mr. Abraham De La Pryme, a student in the University at the time of this occurrence.

"February, 3 1692. Mr. Newton wrote a very important book which got burned."

<!--  (whom I have very oft seen), Fellow of Trinity College, that is mighty famous for his learning, being a most excellent mathematician, philosopher, divine, &c. He has been Fellow of the Royal Society these many years; and among other very learned books and tracts, he's written one upon the mathematical principles of philosophy, which has given him a mighty name, he having received, especially from Scotland, abundance of congratulatory letters for the same; but of all the books he ever wrote, there was one of colours and light, established upon thousands of experiments which he had been twenty years of making, and which had cost him many hundreds of pounds. 

 This book which he valued so much, and which was so much talked of, had the ill luck to perish, and be utterly lost just when the learned author was almost at putting a conclusion at the same, after this manner: In a winter's morning, leaving it among his other papers on his study table while he went to chapel, the candle, which he had unfortunately left burning there, too, catched hold by some means of other papers, and they fired the aforesaid book, and utterly consumed it and several other valuable writings; and which is most wonderful did no further mischief.

 But when Mr. Newton came from chapel, and had seen what was done, every one thought he would have run mad, he was so troubled thereat that he was not himself for a month after. A long account of this his system of colours you may find in the Transactions of the Royal Society, which he had sent up to them long before this sad mischance happened unto him." -->

All of Newton's theological writings, with the exception of the Letters to Dr. Bentley, were composed before this sad event.

 <!-- which, we must conclude, from Pryme's words, produced a serious impression upon our author for about a month.  -->

<!-- But M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, relying on a memorandum contained in a small manuscript Journal of Huygens, declares this occurrence to have caused a derangement of -->

M. Biot says that this caused Newton's intellect to get deranged. 

<!-- M. Biot's opinions and deductions, however, as well as those of La Place, upon this subject, were based upon erroneous data, and have been overthrown by the clearest proof. 

There is not, in fact, the least evidence that Newton's reason was, for a single moment, dethroned; on the contrary, the testimony is conclusive that he was, at all times, perfectly capable of carrying on his mathematical, metaphysical and astronomical inquiries. Loss of sleep, loss of appetite, and irritated nerves will disturb somewhat the equanimity of the most serene; and an act done, or language employed, under such temporary discomposure, is not a just criterion of the general tone and strength of a man's mind.  -->

<!-- As to the accident itself, we may suppose, whatever might have been its precise nature, that it greatly distressed him, and, still further, that its shock may have originated the train of nervous derangements, which afflicted him, more or less, for two years afterward. Yet, during this very period of ill health, we find him putting forth his highest powers.  -->

In 1692, he prepared for, and transmitted to Dr. Wallis the first proposition of the Treatise on Quadratures, with examples of it in first, second and third fluxions. 

He investigated, in the same year, the subject of haloes; making and recording numerous and important observations relative thereto. 

Those profound and beautiful Letters to Dr. Bentley were written at the close of this and the beginning of the next year.

In October 1693, Locke was about to publish a second edition of his work on the Human Understanding. He asked Newton to reconsider his opinions on innate ideas. 

In 1694, Newton was zealously occupied in perfecting his lunar theory: visiting Flamstead, at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, in September, and obtaining a series of lunar observations; and commencing, in October, a correspondence with that distinguished practical Astronomer, which continued till 1698.


<!-- We now arrive at the period when Newton permanently withdrew from the seclusion of a collegiate, and entered upon a more active and public life. -->

Newton was appointed Warden of the Mint, in 1695, through the influence of Charles Montague, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and afterward Earl of Halifax. 

The current coin of the nation had been adulterated and debased.

Montague undertook a re-coinage.

Newton's mathematical and chemical knowledge proved useful in accomplishing this difficult and most salutary reform.

In 1699, he was promoted to the Mastership of the Mint—an office worth 1,200-1,500 pounds per annum, and which he held during the remainder of his life.

He wrote, in this capacity, an official Report on the Coinage, which has been published; he also prepared a Table of Assays of Foreign Coins, which was printed at the end of Dr. Arbuthnot's Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures, in 1727.

Newton retained his Professorship at Cambridge till 1703. 

But he had, on receiving the appointment of Master of the Mint, in 1699, made Mr. Whiston his deputy, with all the emoluments of the office; and, on finally resigning, procured his nomination to the vacant Chair.
