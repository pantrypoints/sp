## Proposition 15 Theorem 7

The periodic times in ellipses are in the sesquiplicate ratio of their greater axes.

The lesser axis is a mean proportional between the greater axis and the latus rectum. Therefore, the rectangle under the axes is in the ratio compounded of the  subduplicate ratio of the latus rectum and the sesquiplicate ratio of the greater axis.

But this rectangle (by Cor. 3, Prop 14) is

### Corollary 

Therefore the periodic times in whose diameters are equal ellipses are the same as in circles to the greater axes of the ellipses.
