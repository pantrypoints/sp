In shapes where the latera recta are equal, the velocity of a body is reciprocally as the perpendicular let fall from the focus on the tangent.

### Corollary 6

In a parabola, the velocity is  reciprocally in the subduplicate ratio.of the distance of the body from the focus of the figure; it is more variable in the ellipsis, and less in the hyperbola, than according to this
