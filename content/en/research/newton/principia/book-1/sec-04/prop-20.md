## Proposition 20 PROBLEM 12

Around a given focus to describe any trajectory given in specie which shall pass through given points, and touch right lines given by position.


### CASE 1


Case 1. About the focus S it is required to describe a trajectory ABC, passing through two points B, C. Because the trajectory is given in specie, the ratio of the principal axis to the distance of the foci will be given. In that ratio take KB to BS, and LC to CS. About the centres B, C, with the intervals BK, CL, describe two circles; and on the right line KL, that touches the same in K and L, let fall the perpendicular SG; which cut in A and a, so that GA may be to AS, and Ga to aS, as KB to BS; and with the axis Aa, and vertices A, a, describe a trajectory: I say the thing is done. For let H be the other focus of the described figure, and seeing GA is to AS as Ga to aS, then by division we shall have Ga - GA, or Aa to aS - AS, or SH in the same ratio, and therefore in the ratio which the principal axis of the figure to be described has to the distance of its foci; and therefore the described figure is of the same species with the figure which was to be described. And since KB to BS, and LC to CS, are in the same ratio, this figure will pass through the points B, C, as is manifest from the conic sections.



## CASE 2


Around the focus S it is required to describe a trajectory which shall somewhere touch two right lines TR, tr. From the focus on those tangents let fall the perpendiculars ST, St, which produce to V, v, so that TV, tv may be equal to TS, tS. Bisect Vv in O, and erect the indefinite perpendicular OH, and cut the right line VS infinitely produced in K and k, so that VK be to KS, and Vk to kS, as the principal axis of the trajectory to be described is to the distance of its foci. On the diameter Kk describe a circle cutting OH in H; and with the foci S, H, and principal axis equal to VH, describe a trajectory: I say, the thing is done. For bisecting Kk in X, and joining HX, HS, HV, Hv, because VK is to KS as Vk to kS; and by composition, as VK + Vk to KS + kS; and by division, as Vk - VK to kS - KS, that is, as 2VX to 2KX, and 2KX to 2SX, and therefore as VX to HX and HX to SX, the triangles VXH, HXS will be similar; therefore VH will be to SH as VX to XH; and therefore as VK to KS. Wherefore VH, the principal axis of the described trajectory, has the same ratio to SH, the distance of the foci, as the principal axis of the trajectory which was to be described has to the distance of its foci; and is therefore of the same species. And seeing VH, vH are equal to the principal axis, and VS, vS are perpendicularly bisected by the right lines TR, tr, it is evident (by Lem. XV) that those right lines touch the described trajectory.   Q.E.F.


Case. 3. About the focus S it is required to describe a trajectory, which shall touch a right line TR in a given Point R. On the right line TR let fall the perpendicular ST, which produce to V, so that TV may be equal to ST; join VR, and cut the right line VS indefinitely produced in K and k, so that VK may be to SK, and Vk to Sk, as the principal axis of the ellipsis to be described to the distance of its foci; and on the diameter Kk describing a circle, cut the right line VR produced in H; then with the foci S, H, and principal axis equal to VH, describe a trajectory: I say, the thing is done. For VH is to SH as VK to SK, and therefore as the principal axis of the trajectory which was to be described to the distance of its foci (as appears from what we have demonstrated in Case 2); and therefore the described trajectory is of the same species with that which was to be described; but that the right line TR, by which the angle VRS is bisected, touches the trajectory in the point R, is certain from the properties of the conic sections.   Q.E.F.


Case 4. About the focus S it is required to describe a trajectory APB that shall touch a right line TR, and pass through any given point P without the tangent, and shall be similar to the figure apb, described with the principal axis ab, and foci s, h. On the tangent TR let fall the perpendicular ST, which produce to V, so that TV may be equal to ST; and making the angles hsq, shq, equal to the angles VSP, SVP, about q as a centre, and with an interval which shall be to ab as SP to VS, describe a circle cutting the figure apb in p: join sp, and draw SH such that it may be to sh as SP is to sp, and may make the angle PSH equal to the angle psh, and the angle VSH equal to the angle psq. Then with the foci S, H, and principal axis AB, equal to the distance VH, describe a conic section: I say, the thing is done; for if sv is drawn so that it shall be to sp as sh is to sq, and shall make the angle vsp equal to the angle hsq, and the angle vsh equal to the angle psq, the triangles svh, spq, will be similar, and therefore vh will be to pq as sh is to sq; that is (because of the similar triangles VSP, hsq), as VS is to SP, or as ab to pq. Wherefore vh and ab are equal. But, because of the similar triangles VSH, vsh, VH is to SH as vh to sh; that is, the axis of the conic section now described is to the distance of its foci as the axis ab to the distance of the foci sh; and therefore the figure now described is similar to the figure aph. But, because the triangle PSH is similar to the triangle psh, this figure passes through the point P; and because VH is equal to its axis, and VS is perpendicularly bisected by the right line TR, the said figure touches the right line TR.
