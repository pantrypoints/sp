## Proposition 25 Problem 27

Draw a trajectory that shall pass through two given points, and touch three right lines given by position.

Through the concourse of any two of the tangents one with the other, and the concourse of the third tangent with the right line which passes through the two given points, draw an indefinite right line and, taking this line for the first ordinate radius, transform the figure by the preceding

In this figure those two tangents will become

line that passes through the two given points.
Suppose hi, kl to be those
two parallel tangents, ik the third tangent, and hi a right line parallel
