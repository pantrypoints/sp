## Proposition 34 Theorem 10

If `BED` is a parabola, the speed of a falling body in any place `C` will be equal to the speed by which a body uniformly draws a circle around centre `B` at half the interval `BC`.

Cor. 7, Prop. 16 says that the speed of a body in a parabola `RPB` around the center `S` in any place `P`, is equal to the body's speed uniformly tracing a circle around the same centre `S` at half the interval `SP`. 

This proposition is proven by reducing the width `CP` of the parabola infinitely so as the parabolic arc `PfB` coincides with the line `CB`.
- The centre `S` with vertex `B`, and the interval `SP` with the interval `BC`, and
