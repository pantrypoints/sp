### PROPOSITION 45 PROBLEM 35

Find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching very near to circles

This problem is solved arithmetically by reducing the orbit, which a body revolving in a movable ellipsis (as in Cor. 2 and 3 of the above Prop.) describes in an immovable plane, to the figure of the orbit whose apsides are required. And then seeking the apsides of the orbit which that

But orbits acquire the same figure,
