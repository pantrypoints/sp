## PROPOSITION 54 PROBLEM 30

Granting the quadratures of curvilinear figures, it is required to find
the times in which bodies by means of any centripetal force will descend
or ascend in any curve lines described in, a plane passing through the
centre of force.
Let the body descend from any place S, and move in any curve ST/R
given in a plane passing through the centre of force C. Join CS, and lei

Therefore its motion, so far as it has

By the same reasoning, if a body, acted on by forces tending to
