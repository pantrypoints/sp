The same laics of attraction being supposed, I say, that the exterior body
S does, by radii dra.cn to the point O, the common centre of gravity
of the interior bodies P and T, describe round that centre areas more
proportional to the times, and an orbit more approaching to the form
than, it can describe
of an ellipsis having its focus in that cen
round the innermost and greatest body T by ra Hi drawn to that body.

by a more prolix reasoning, which I therefore pass over. It will be suf

common centre, and moreover the common centre of gravity of all the three
bodies were at rest, the body S on one side, and the common centre of
gravity of the other two bodies on the other side, would describe true ellipses about that quiescent common centre. This appears from Cor. 2, Pro]) LVIII, compared with what was demonstrated in Prop. LX1V, and LXV

Therefore if each of the bodies of the system A, B, C, D, etc. 
does singly attract all the rest with accelerative forces that are reciprocally
as the squares of the distances from the attracting body, the absolute forces
of all those bodies will be to each other as the bodies themselves.

SCHOLIUM.
These Propositions naturally lead us to the analogy there is between
centripetal forces, and the central bodies to which those forces used to be
directed for it is reasonable to suppose that forces which are directed to
bodies should depend upon the nature and quantity of those bodies, as we
see they do in magnetical experiments.
And when such cases occur, we

soever,

or incorporeal, any how impelling bodies placed therein towards each other.
In the same general sense I use the word impulse, not defining in this trea

In mathematics we are to

upon any conditions supposed then,
when we enter upon physics, we compare those
proportions with the phe
nomena of Nature, that we may know what conditions of those forces an
