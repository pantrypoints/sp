Let us suppose that segment to

Let that thickness be called O, and (by what Archi

PF X DF X O. Let us suppose besides the attrac

## SCHOLIUM

The attractions of sphaerical bodies being now explained, it comes next in order to treat of the laws of attraction in other bodies consisting in like manner of 
sary to attractive particles but to treat of them particularly is not neces
my design. It will be sufficient to subjoin some general proposi
;
tions relating to the forces of such bodies, and the motions thence arising,
because the knowledge of these will be of some little use in philosophical
inquiries.
