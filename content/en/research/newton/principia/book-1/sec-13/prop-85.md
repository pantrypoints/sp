### Proposition 85 THEOREM 43

If a body be attracted by another, and its attraction be vastly stronger contiguous to the attracting body than when they are separated from one another by a very small interval ; the forces of the particles of the attracting body decrease, in the recess of the body at tracted, in more than a duplicate ratio of the distance of the particles.

Therefore if, as the distances of the corpuscles attracted increase,
the attractive forces of the particles decrease in the ratio of any power
of the distances, the accelerative attractions towards the whole bodies will

Hence, on the other hand, from the forces with which like bodies
attract corpuscles similarly situated, may be collected the ratio of the de
