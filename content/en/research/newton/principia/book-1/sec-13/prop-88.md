## PROPOSITION 88 THEOREM 45

If the attractive forces of the equal particles of any body be as the distance of the places from the particles, the force of the whole body will tend to its centre of gravity ; and will be the same with the force of a globe, consisting of similar and equal matter, and having its centre in the centre of gravity.

Let the particles A, B, of the body RSTV at tract any corpuscle Z with forces which, supposing the particles to be equal between themselves, are as the distances

but, if they are supposed unequal, are as those particles and their distances AZ, BZ, conjunctly, or (if I may
go speak) as those particles drawn into their distances AZ,

Let those forces be expressed by the respectively.

By the same reasoning, if there be added a third particle G, and the

RSTV were sphaerical and therefore if that attract
