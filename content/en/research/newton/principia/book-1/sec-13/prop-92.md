### Proposition 92 Problem 46

An attracting body being given, it is required to find the ratio of the decrease of the centripetal forces tending to its several points. 

The body given must be formed into a sphere, a cylinder, or some regular figure,
whose law of attraction answering to any ratio of decrease may be found by Prop. 80, 81, 91

Then, by experiments, the force of the attractions must be found at several distances, and the law
of attraction towards the whole, made known by that means, will give
which was to
the ratio of the decrease of the forces of the several parts be found.

## SCHOLIUM

If a body is attracted perpendicularly towards a given plane, and from
the law of attraction given, the motion of the body be required
the Pro
blem will be solved by seeking (by Prop.
the motion of the body
39)

descending in a right line towards that plane, and (by Cor. 2, of the Laws)
compounding that motion with an uniform motion performed in the direc
tion of lines parallel to that plane.
