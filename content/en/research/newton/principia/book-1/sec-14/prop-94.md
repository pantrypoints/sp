## Proposition 94 Theorem 48

If two similar mediums be separated from each other by a space terminated on both sides by parallel planes, and a body in its passage through that space be attracted or impelled perpendicularly towards either of those mediums, and not agitated or hindered by any other force ; and the attraction be every where the same at equal distances either plane, taken towards the same hand of the plane, that the sine of incidence upon either plane will be to the sine of emcr from gence from the other plane in a given ratio.
