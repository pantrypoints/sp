## PROPOSITION 95 THEOREM 50

The motion before incidence is swifter than afterwards ; 1 sat/, lhat if the line of incidence be inclined continually, the body will be at last reflected, and the angle of reflexion will be equal to the
angle of incidence. 

For conceive the body passing between the parallel planes

right one, and therefore the line of emergence will coincide with the plane
Dd. Let the body come to this plane in the point R and because the
