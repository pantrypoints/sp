## Proposition 5 Theorem 3

If a body is resisted in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, and moves by innate force only through a similar medium; and the times be taken in a geometrical progression, proceeding from less to greater terms = that the velocities at the beginning of each of the times are in the same geometrical progression inversely ; and that the spaces are equal, which are described in each of the times.

For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the decrement of the
is to the resist velocity proportional ance = if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles, the
squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities.
