### Proposition 21 Theorem 16

The density of any fluid be proportional to the compression, and its parts be attracted downwards by a centripetal force reciprocally proportional to the distances from the centre = I say, that, if those distances be taken continually proportional, the densities of the fluid at same distances 

will be also continually proportional.
