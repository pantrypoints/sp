The quantities of matter in funependulous bodies, whose centres of oscillation are equally distant from, the centre of suspension, are in a, ratio compounded of the ratio of the weights and the duplicate ratio of the times of the oscillations in vacuo.

The velocity which a given force can generate in a given matter in a given time is as the force and the time directly, and the matter inversely.

The greater the force or the time is, or the less the matter, the greater velocity will be generated. This is in the 2nd Law of Motion.
