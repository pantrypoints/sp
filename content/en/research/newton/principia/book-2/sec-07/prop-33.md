## Most parts of systems are resisted in a duplicate ratio of their velocities, and the duplicate ratio of their diameters and the simple ratio of the parts of the systems. 


The resistance arises partly from the centripetal or centrifugal forces that act on the system mutually, partly from the collisions and reflections of the particles and the greater parts.

### The resistances of collision 

This leads to the acceleration of the body through its parts, as:
- the squares of the velocities directly
- the distances of the corresponding particles inversely
- the mass in those particles directly 


The distances of the particles in System 1 are to the correspondent distances of the particles of System 2 as the diameter of one particle or part in System 1 to the
cles in


diameter of the correspondent particle or part in the other

Mass are as the densities of the parts of the systems. 

### The resistances of reflection 

These are the number of correspondent reflexions and the forces of those reflexions conjunctly but
the number of the reflexions are to each other as the velocities of the corresponding parts directly and the spaces between their reflexions inversely.

the forces of the reflexions are as the velocities and the magnitudes
and the densities of the corresponding parts conjunctly that is, as the ve
locities and the cubes of the diameters and the densities of the parts. And,
;
joining all these ratios, the resistances of the corresponding parts are to
each other as the squares of the velocities and the squares of the diameters
and the densities of the parts conjunctly. Q.E.T).

### Corollary 1

Therefore if those systems are two elastic fluids, like our air, and their parts are at rest among themselves and two similar bodies proportional in magnitude and density to the parts of the fluids, and similarly gituated among those parts, be any how projected in the direction of lines
and the accelerative forces with which the particles of
