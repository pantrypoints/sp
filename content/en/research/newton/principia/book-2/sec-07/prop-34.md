If iu a rare medium, consisting of equal particles freely disposed at
equal distances from each other, a globe and a cylinder described on
equal diameters move with equal velocities in
the.
direction of the axis
of the cylinder, the resistance of the globe ivill be but half so great an
that of the cylinder.
For

Cor. 5 of the Laws) whether the body

whether the particles of the medium
impinge with the same velocity upon
the quiescent body, let us consider
the body as if it were quiescent, and
see with what force it would be im-
pelled by the moving medium.

Let, therefore,

latter solid is a cylinder circumscribing the

that a paraboloid is half its circumscribed cylinder.
Therefore the whole

medium upon the globe is half of the entire force of the same
upon the cylinder. And therefore if the particles of the medium are at
rest, and the cylinder and globe move with equal velocities, the resistance
force of the

By the same method other figures may be compared together as to their
resistance; and those may be found which are most apt to continue their
motions in resisting mediums. As if upon the circular base CEBH from
the centre O, with thy radius OC, and the altitude OD, one would construct
a frustum
