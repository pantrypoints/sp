V.
If a cylinder, a sphere, and a spheroid, of equal breadths be placed suc
cessively in the middle of a cylindric canal, so that their axes may
coincide with the axis of the canal, these bodies will equally hinder t^e
passage of the water through the canal.
For the spaces lying between the
sides of the canal,

and the cylinder,
and the
passes, are equal

water will pass equally through equal spaces.
