Bodies carried around in a vortex, and returning in the same orb, are of the same density with the vortex.

They are moved according to the same law with the parts of the vortex, as to velocity and direction of motion.


The particles or physical points of the vortex preserve a given situation among each other.

If these particles are be congealed, this particle will move according to the same law as before. This is because no change is made either in its density, vis insita, or shape.

This fluid vortex will move according to the same law as before if its congealed or solid part is of the same density with the rest of the vortex.
- Its fluid particles may be moved among themselves. 
<!-- , and be resolved into a fluid,  -->


Neglect the motion of the particles among themselves. 
- This is because it does not concern at all the progressive motion of the whole. 
- This will lead to the motion of the whole being the same as before. 

But this motion will be the same with the motion of other parts of the vortex at equal distances from the centre.
- This is because the solid, now resolved into a fluid, is become perfectly like to the other parts of the vortex. 

Therefore a solid, if it be of the same density with the matter of the vortex, will move with the same motion as its parts, being relatively at rest in the matter that surrounds it. 

If it is more dense, it will try more to move away from the centre.

It will overcome that force of the vortex which is kept in equilibrio while it was retained in its orbit.

 <!-- in its revolution describe a  -->
It will move away from the centre and will follow a spiral, leaving its orbit. 

 <!-- returning no longer into the same orbit. And, by the same argument,  -->

If it be more rare, it will move to the centre. 

Therefore it can never continually go around in the same orbit unless it is of the same density with the fluid.

But in that case, it would revolve according to the same law with those parts of the fluid that are at the same or equal distances from the centre of the vortex.


### Corollary 1

Therefore a solid revolving in a vortex, and continually going round in the same orbit, is relatively quiescent in the fluid that carries it.


### Corollary 2

If the vortex has a uniform density, the same body may revolve at any distance from the vortex' centre.



## SCHOLIUM

Hence, the planets are not carried round in corporeal vortices.

According to the Copernican hypothesis, the planets going round the sun revolve in ellipses. They have the sun in their common focus.

The radii drawn to the sun draw areas proportional to the times. 

But the parts of a vortex can never revolve with such a motion.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/53s.jpg" a="Drawing" >}}

Let `AD, BE, CF` be 3 orbits around sun `S`.
- The utmost circle `CF` is concentric to the Sun

The aphelia of the two innermost are `A, B`. Their perihelia `D, E`. 

Therefore a body revolving in the orb `CF`, draws by a radius drawn to the sun, areas proportional to the times. These will move with an uniform motion. 

According to the laws of astronomy, the body revolving in the orb `BE` will move:
- slower in its aphelion `B`
- faster in its perihelion `E`

According to the laws of mechanics, the matter of the vortex should move faster in the narrow space between `A` and `C` than in the wide space between `D` and `P`. 
- It should faster in the aphelion than in the perihelion. 

These 2 conclusions contradict each other. 

The aphelion of Mars is currently at the beginning of Virgo.

The distance between the orbits of Mars and Venus now is around 3 to 2 their distance at the beginning of Pisces. 

<!-- is to the distance between the same orbits, at the  of the sign of Pisces, as about 3 to 2. -->

Therefore, the vortex matter between those orbits should faster at the beginning of Pisces than at the beginning of Virgo in the ratio of 3 to 2.

This is because the narrower the space is through which the same quantity of matter passes in the same time of one revolution, the greater will be the velocity with which it passes through it. 

[Descartes assumes] that the earth:
- is relatively at rest in this celestial matter
- is carried around by it
- revolves together with it around the sun.

If so, the earth's velocity at the beginning of Pisces would be have a sesquialteral ratio to its velocity at the beginning of Virgo.

Therefore, the sun's apparent diurnal motion:
- at the beginning of Virgo should be above 70 minutes
- at the beginning of Pisces shuld be less than 48 minutes

But in reality, that apparent motion of the sun is really greater at the beginning of Pisces than at the beginning of Virgo.

 <!-- as experience testifies.  -->

Therefore the earth is faster at the beginning of Virgo than at the beginning of Pisces.

Thus, the hypothesis of vortices is utterly irreconcileable with astronomical phenomena. It rather perplexes than explains the heavenly motions.

Book 1 explains how these motions are performed in free spaces without vortices.

<!-- , may be understood by the first Book; and I shall now more fully treat of it in the following Book." -->

<!-- PS. It should be noted that also the mathematics of the motion of a spinning solid disc (in line perhaps with the ideas of Aristotle or early Kepler), do not match the mathematics of the actual motion of the planets around the sun. So neither the mathematics of the motion of a spinning solid disc nor of the motion of a spinning fluid, match the mathematics of the actual motion of the planets around the sun. 

This seemingly proves that no mechanical push-physics can explain gravity (or magnetism) or be an acceptable physics. Only the mathematics of Gilbert-Newton signal-response attraction physics match the mathematics of the actual motion of the planets around the sun and can explain gravity. 

Newton showed that no simple push-physics can explain planet motion, though possibly some as yet undemonstrated several different forms of pushings in combination might somehow.

So fake textbook 'Newtonian physics' that tries to present magnetism and gravity as just different forms of Descartes' one push-force, rather than them being signal-response forces, cannot be shown to work ! 

But still Newton, like some other physicists of the time, was bullied out of committing to Gilbertian action-at-distance signal-response physics for a no-physics-is-provable blackbox physics. 

Some later physicists like Einstein did try to develop a more suited mathematics using different theories, but even where their mathematics looks good their theories maybe remain doubtful. And the modern discovery of gravity Black Holes and universe expansion seems to really back Gilbert-Newton attraction physics further and not any kind of mechanical push-physics, with a signal-response physics being basically an advanced information-handling physics.

Though never publishing it, Newton seems to have considered that he had also disproved Descartes' theory of terrestrial gravity as he conjectured in his unpublished notes 'Certain Philosophical Questions'. 

For terrestrial gravity to be due to some matter pushing bodies towards the Earth, as per Descartes, must require perfect penetration which contradicts pushing - and matter causing gravity by pushing must also push itself and that cause further contradictory effects.

(Note that reception plus re-emission could appear to be penetration, but gravitational attraction by pushing has further problems)
At 113r-v there Newton also conjectured that collision motion must be due to a force like gravity, and said that a thing that penetrates all matter he terms a 'spirit' - though William Gilbert earlier had preferred the term 'non-corporeal body'.


[Try colliding two magnets North-to-North in a tube at different velocities, and observe their collision and rebound ?] [In similar manner to Newton's disproof of Cartesian planet orbit vortex theory, it should be possible to disprove the general Cartesian small-particle-push theory of matter-penetrating magnetism and gravity. The experiments could involve a series of metal meshes of differing hole size allowing 1%, 50%, 99% air penetration and measuring the actual push forces produced for each to give a penetration/push-force equation to find if the Cartesian theory is or is not practicable physics ?]


As well as disproving several aspects of Descartes mechanical theory like his planet motion vortex theory, Newton also disproved Galileo's mechanical theory of Earth tides in general favour of the earlier Gilbertian theory that tides were caused chiefly by the attraction of the Moon. 

Leibnitz wrongly supported Descartes push-vortex planetary motion against 'Newton's' Gilbertian action-at-distance planetary motion. 

But like many then wrongly assumed action-at-distance physics as Newton's idea, though it came from William Gilbert who both Robert Hooke and Kepler had certainly studied and who had both influenced Newton. Often Newton avoided ascribing poorer Descartes theories to Descartes when disproving them, maybe as a kindness towards Descartes that was not returned by his opponents who could only create lies about Newton 'having a bad personality'. 

Newton was maybe also showing some kindness towards Descartes and others in not naming those he considered science giants on whose shoulders he stood ? 

He certainly seems to have considered that most if not all of his physics peers of that time were very second rate scientists, though refraining from saying so. But Newton's not naming those he considered science giants was no doubt also part of his determined efforts to avoid himself being associated with the then demonised William Gilbert whose physics he privately favoured ?

That gravitational force is produced by objects only proportional to their inertia or mass, seems proven by Galileo's on-Earth experiments, by Newton's proof that in-space planet motions seem consistent with that and more recently also by near-Earth space measurements of variations in Earth's gravity by NASA's orbiting GRACE project. 

(Newton did demonstrate that gravitational attraction could maintain solar system orbits for a very long time, though he did not examine all possible solar system gravity issues - for more on this see our Solar System Problems.)

And that gravity decreases with distance from a producing object was demonstrated by numbers of physicists including Cavendish in 1798 (see Vision Learning) and was also recently confirmed for short distances by a University of Washington project as in Physical Review Focus at http://focus.aps.org/story/v7/st8

Galileo showing that all objects tend to fall to the surface of the earth with the same acceleration, is evidence that response to gravity seems proportional to inertia or mass.

Of course Einstein later claimed that Newtonian gravitation does not always hold accurately, with some claimed evidence of that.
