## Proposition 1

The mean motion of the sun from the node is defined by a geometric mean proportional between the mean motion of the sun and that mean motion with which the sun recedes with the greatest swiftness from the node in the quadratures.


Let:

- T is the earth s place
- Nn is the line of the moon's nodes at any given time KTM a perpendicular thereto
- TA is a right line revolving around the centre with the same angular velocity with which the sun and
the node recede from one another, in such sort that the angle between the quiescent right line Nra and the revolving line may be always equal

distance of the places of the sun and node.
Now if any right line
be divided into parts
and SK, and thost parts be taken as the
mean horary motion of the sun to the mean horary motion of the node in
to the

tional between the part
and the whole TK, this right line will be pro
portional to the sun s mean motion from the node.
