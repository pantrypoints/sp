## Proposition 35 Problem 16

With a given time, find the inclination of the moom's  orbit to the plane of the eclipltic. 

Let:

- AD is the sine of the greatest inclination
- AB is the sine of the least inclination

Bisect BD inC and around the centre C, with the interval BC, describe the circle BGD. 

In AC, take CE in the same proportion to EB as EB to twice BA. If to the time given we set off the angle

### SCHOLIUM

By these computations of the lunar motions, I showed that by the theory of gravity the motions of the moon could be calculated from their physical causes.

Moreover, I found that the annual equation of the
mean motion of the moon arises from the various dilatation which the orbit of the according to Cor.
6, Prop. 56 Book 1. 

The force of this action is greater in the perigeon sun, and dilates the moon's orbit in the apogeon sun it is less, and permits the orbit to be again contracted. 

The moon moves slower in the dilated and faster in the contracted orbit and the annual equation, by which this inequality is regulated, vanishes in the
