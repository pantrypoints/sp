## Proposition 36 Problem 17= Find the force of the sun to move the sea

The sun s force ML or PT to disturb the motions of the moon, was (by Prop 25) in the moon's quadratures, to the force of gravity with us, as 1 to 638092.6

The force TM -- LM or 2PK in the moon's syzygies is double that. 

But, descending to the surface of the earth, these forces are diminished in proportion of the distances from the centre of the earth, in the proportion of 60 1/2 to 1. Therefore, the former force on the earth's surface 1 to

the other force, which

twice as great, the sea

not only in the places directly under the sun, but in those also which are
and the sum of these forces is to the force of gravity
directly opposed to it
And because the same force excites the same motion,

;
whether
it
depresses the waters in those places which are 90 degrees distant
in the places which are directly under and di
from the sun, or raises them
rectly opposed to the sun, the aforesaid sum will be the total force of the
sun to disturb the sea, and will have the same effect as if the whole was
employed in raising the sea in the places directly under and directly op
posed to the sun, and did not act at all in the places which are 90 degrees
removed from the sun.
And
this is the force of the
where the sun

sun to disturb the sea in any given place,

from the earth.
In other positions of the sun, its force to raise the sea is
as the versel sine of double its altitude above the horizon of the place di
and the cu.be of the distance from the earth reciprocally.
