## Proposition 37 Problem 18= Find the force of the moon to move the sea

The force of the moon to move the sea is to be deduced from its proportion to the sun's force. This proportion is to be collected from the proportion of the motions of the sea, which are the effects of those forces. 

Before the mouth of the river Avon, three miles below Bristol, the height of the ascent of the water in the vernal and autumnal syzygies of the luminaries (by the observations of Samuel Sturmy} amounts to about 45
feet, but in the quadratures to 25 only.

The former of those heights arises from the sum of the aforesaid forces, the latter from their difference.
therefore, S and L are supposed to represent respectively the forces of the sun and moon

distances from the earth, we shall have

Samuel Colepress observed at Plymouth that the tide in its mean height rises to about 16 feet, and in the spring and autumn tlu-
height thereof in the syzygies may exceed that in the quadratures by more
than 7 or 8 feet. Suppose the greatest difference of those heights to be 9

But because of the reciprocal motions of the waters, the greatest tides do

### Corollary 1

Since the waters excited by the sun s force rise to the height of 1 foot and 11 1/36 inches, the moon's force will raise the same to the height of 8 feet and 7 x/xx inches. The joint forces of both will raise the same

a force of that quantity is abundantly sufficient to ex

### Corollary 3 

The force of the moon to move the sea is like the force of the sun as 4,4815 to 1.

Book 1) are as the densities of the bodies of the sun and moon and the
cubes of their apparent diameters conjunctly, the density of the moon will

### Corollary 4

The true diameter of the moon is to the true diameter of the earth as 100 to 365. The mass of matter in the moon will be to the mass of matter in the earth as 1 to 39,788.

### Corollary 5

The accelerative gravity on the surface of the moon will be around 3 times less than the accelerative gravity on the surface of the earth.

### Corollary 6 

The distance of the earth will be to the distance of the moon s centre from the centre moon s centre from the common
of gravity of the earth and moon as 40,783 to 39,788.

14,8538067 feet. And, therefore, at the distance of 19615800, which

And by

In the moon s syzygies its mean horizontal parallax in the latitudes of 0, 30, 38, 45, 52, 60, 90 degrees is 57 20, 57 16&quot;, 57 14 57

In these computations, I do not consider the magnetic attraction of the Earth which would be very small and unknown. If this should be found, the measures of degrees upon the meridian, the lengths of isochronous pendulums in different parallels, the laws of the motions of the sea, and the moon s parallax, with the apparent diameters of the sun and the moon, should be more exactly determined from phenomena. We should then be enabled to bring this calculation to a greater accuracy.
