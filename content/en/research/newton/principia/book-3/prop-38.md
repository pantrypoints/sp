## Proposition 38 Problem 19L Find the shape of the moon's body.

If the moon's body were fluid like our sea, the force of the earth to raise that fluid in the nearest and remotest parts would be to the force of the moon by which our sea is raised in the places under and opposite to the moon as the accelerative gravity of the moon towards the earth to the accelerative gravity of the earth towards the moon, and the diameter of the
moon to the diameter of the earth conjunctly that is, as 39,788 to 1, and 100 to 365 conjunctly, or as 1081 to 100.

Since our sea, by the force of the moon, is raised to Sf feet, the lunar fluid would be raised
by the force of the earth to 93 feet and upon this account the figure of the moon would be a spheroid, whose greatest diameter produced would

pass through the centre of the earth, and exceed the diameters perpendicu
186 feet. Such a figure, therefore, the moon
and
lar thereto by
affects, must have put on from the beginning.


### Corollary 

Hence, the same face of the moon always respects the
earth nor can the body of the moon possibly rest in any other position,
but would return always by a libratory motion to this situation but those
librations, however, must be exceedingly slow, because of the weakness of
the forces which excite them so that the face of the moon, which should be always obverted to the earth, may, for the reason assigned in Prop.
be turned towards the other focus of the moon s orbit, without

being im
mediately drawn back, and converted again towards the earth.

### Lemma 1

The Earth is represented by `APEp` with the centre C.  

If the poles P, p, and the equator AE; and if about the centre C, with APEp
the radius denote tJie CP, we suppose the sphere Pape to be described, and Q li to plane on which a right line, drawn from the centre of the of the earth, i/isists at right angles ; and further the that several particles of the whole exterior earth PapAP^pE, suppose without the height of the said sphere, endeavour to recede towards t/iis sun to the centre
and from the plane Q.R, every particle by a force pro
distance portional from that plane ; I say, in the first place, that the whole force and efficacy of all the particles that are situate in AE, the circle of the equator, and disposed uniformly without the globe,
side that side to its encompassing the same after the
manner of a ring, to iclieel the earth the whole force and efficacy of as many particles in that point the of
equator which is at the greatest distance from the plane Q,R, to wheel the earth about its centre with a like circular And that circular motion will be performed about motion, as I to 2.

For let there be described from the centre K, with the diameter IL, the
semi-circle INL.

Then the force by which the particle F recede*

And
because the action of those particles is exerted in the direction of
lines perpendicularly receding from the plane QR, and that
equally from
each side of this plane, they will wheel about the circumference of the circle
of the equator, together with the adherent body of the earth, round an axis
which
lies as
well in the plane
QR
as in that of the equator.

### HYPOTHESIS 2

If the other parts of the earth were taken away, and the remaining ring was carried alone about the sun in the orbit of the earth by the annual motion, while by the diurnal motion it was in the mean time revolved about its own axis inclined to the plane of the ecliptic by an angle of 23 1/2 degrees, the motion of the equinoctial points would be the same, whether the ring were fluid, or whether it consisted of a hard
and rigid matter.
