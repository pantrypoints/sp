Because, therefore, the nodes of the moon would be yearly transferred 20 11 in antecederttia ;
and, if there were more moons, the motion of the nodes of every one (by
Cor. 16, Pro]). LXVI. Book 1) would be as its periodic time; if upon the

did not mutually touch each the other, or whether they were molten, and formed into a continued ring, or whether that ring should become rigid
and inflexible.

Let us, then, suppose that this ring is in quantity of matter equal to the whole exterior earth PctpAPepR, which lies without the sphere and because this sphere is to that exterior earth as C-
