### Lemma 4

The comets are higher than the moon and in the regions of the planets.


The comets were placed by astronomers above the moon, because they were found to have no diurnal parallax, so their annual parallax is a convincing proof of their descending into the regions of the planets for all the comets which move in a direct course according to the order of the signs, about the end of their appearance become more than ordinarily slow or retrograde, if the earth is between them and the sun
and more than ordinarily swift, if the earth is approaching to a heliocentric opposition
with them whereas, on the other hand, those which move
against the or
der of the signs, towards the end of their
appearance appear swifter than
they ought to be, if the earth is between them and the sun and slower,
and perhaps retrograde, if the earth is in the other side of its orbit. 

These appearances proceed chiefly from the diverse situations which the earth acquires in the course of its motion, after the same manner as it

slowly, and sometimes more swiftly, progressive, according as the motion of
the earth falls in with that of the planet, or is directed the

;
by my computation, to place the disappearing comets a good deal lower
than Jupiter. Whence it follows that when they approach nearer to us in
their perigees and perihelions they often descend below the orbs of Mare
and the inferior planets.

The
near approach of the comets is farther confirmed from the
light of
heads; for the light of a celestial body, illuminated by the sun, and
receding to remote parts, is diminished in the quadruplicate proportion of
the distance; to wit, in one
duplicate proportion, on account of the increase
of the distance from the sun, and in another
duplicate proportion, on ac
count of the decrease of the
apparent diameter. Wherefore if both the
tb.eir
quantity of light and the apparent diameter of a comet are given, its dis
tance will be also given,
by taking the distance of the comet to the distance
of ;i planet in the direct
proportion of their diameters and the reciprocal
subduplicate proportion of their lights.
Thus, in the comet of the year
1682, Mr. Flamsted observed with a telescope of 16 feet, and measured
with a micrometer, the least diameter of its head 2
00; but the nucleus

light and splendor of its head it surpassed that of the comet in the year
1680 and might be compared with the stars of the lirst or second

judged less, sometimes judged equal, to the globe of Saturn within the ring.
Since, then, the diameters of the heads of the
comets seldom exceed 8 or 12 ; and the diameter of the nucleus or central
,
star is but about a tenth or perhaps fifteenth part of the diameter of the
head, it appears that these stars are generally of about the same apparent
magnitude with the planets. But in regard that their light may be often
compared with the light of Saturn, yea, and sometimes exceeds it, it is evi
dent that all comets in their perihelions must either be placed below or not
and they are much mistaken who remove them almost
far above Saturn
as far as the fixed stars for if it was so, the comets could receive no more
light from our sun than our planets do from the fixed stars.
So far we have gone, without considering the obscuration which comets
suffer from that plenty of thick smoke which encompasseth their heads,
and through which the heads always shew dull, as through i cloud; for by

the more a body is obscured by this smoke, by so much the more

But, above all, the thing is evinced from their tails, which
must be owing either to the sun s light reflected by a smoke arising from
them, and dispersing itself through the aether, or to the light of their own
their parallax.
In the former case, we must shorten the distance of the comets,
