The comet of the year 1683 (by the observations of the same LJevelius),

appeared, moved at a very slow rate,

### Corollary 1 

Therefore the comets shine by the sun's light, which they reflect.

### Corollary 2

Comets are so frequently seen in that hemisphere where the sun is, and so seldom in the other.

If they were visible in the regions far above Saturn, they would appear more frequently in the parts opposite to the for such as were in those parts would be nearer to the earth, whereas sun

The celestial spaces are void of resistance.
