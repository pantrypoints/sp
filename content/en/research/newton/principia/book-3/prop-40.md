## Proposition 40 Theorem 20

The comets mnve in some of the conic sections, having their foci as the sun. They trace an orbit to the sun by radii drawn to the sun's center.

This proposition appears from Cor. 1, Prop. 13, compared with Prop. 8, 12, and 13, Book 3.

### Corollary 2

But their orbits will be so near to parabolas, that parabolas
be used for them without sensible error.

### Corollary 3

Therefore, by Cor. 7, Prop. 16, Book 1, the velocity of
comet will be to the every always velocity of any planet, supposed to be revolved at the same distance in a circle about the

After the same method, from five observed latitudes, we may find the

if the differences are greater, as of
