The revolution of the earth means that centripetal forces are actually directed to the bodies of the sun, of the earth, and other planets.

The moon revolves about our earth. A line drawn from the earth's center to the moon coincides with the lunar cycles, from the moon's velocity compared with its diameter. 

The moon's motion is slower when its diameter is less (and therefore is farther from earth). Its motion is faster when its diameter is greater.

The revolutions of Jupiter's moons are more regular
(p. 386). They draw concentric circles with Jupiter by equable motions. 

Saturn's moons revolve circularly. 

Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun just like moons revolve around planets. 

This is why they shine with a full face, when they are in those parts of their orbs which in respect of the earth lie beyond the sun when they appear half full, they are in those parts while over when horned, in those parts which lie between against the sun

If Jupiter was viewed from the sun, it would never appear retrograde nor stationary, as it is seen sometimes from the earth, but always to go forward with a motion nearly uniform (p. 389). And from the very
great inequality of its apparent geocentric motion, we infer (by Prop. Ill
Cor. IV) that the force by which Jupiter is turned out of a rectilinear course,
and made to revolve in an orb, is not directed to the centre of the earth.
same argument holds good in Mars and in Saturn. Another centre
of these forces is therefore to be looked for (by Prop. II and III, and the
Corollaries of the latter), about which the areas described by radii inter

From the regularity of the heliocentric and irregularity of the geocen

Flamsted attempted the same parallax with the micrometer in the perigeon position of Mars. But he never found it above 25". He thus concluded that the sun s parallax at most to be 10".

It follows that the distance of the moon from
the earth bears no greater proportion to the distance of the earth from the sun than 29 to
10,000, nor to the distance of Venus from the sun than 29 to 7,233.

From which distances, together with the periodic times, it is easy to infer that the absolute circumsolar force is greater than the absolute circumterrestrial force at least 229,400 times.

Ricciolus and Vcitdelin observed that the sun's parallax was less than half a minute. 

It follows that the absolute circum-solar force exceeds the absolute circum-terrestrial force 8,500
times.

By the like computations, I discovered an analogy between the forces and the bodies of the planets. But we must first get the apparent diameters of the planets. 

Flamsted measured the diameter of:
- Jupiter to 40-41" (micrometer).
- Saturn's ring to 50"
- the sun to 32'13" 

Huygens and Halley measures the diameter of Saturn's ring as 4 to 9. 
- To Gulletins, it was as 4 to 10
- To Hooke, (by a telescope of 60 feet) it was as 5 to 12

From the mean proportion, 5 to 12, the diameter of Saturn s body is around 21".


Because of the unequal refrangibility of light, all lucid points are dilated by the telescope, and in the focus of the object-glass possess a circular space whose as about the 50th part of the aperture of the glass.

Towards the circumference the light is so rare as hardly to move the sense. 

But towards the middle, it is of greater density and is sensible enough. It makes a small lucid circle, whose breadth varies according to the splendor of the lucid point. But it is generally about the 3d, or 4th, or 5th part of the breadth of the whole.

Of
kin to the analogy we have been describing, there is another observed between the forces and the bodies attracted (p. 395, 396, 397). 

Since the action of the centripetal force upon the planets decreases in the duplicate proportion of the distance, and the periodic time increases in the sesquiplicate thereof, it is evident that the actions of the centripetal force, and
therefore the periodic times, would be equal in equal planets at equal distances from the sun and in equal distances of unequal planets the total actions of the centripetal force would be as the bodies of the planets for
if the actions were not proportional to the bodies to be moved,
they could 
not equally retract these bodies from the tangents of their orbs in equal
times nor could the motions of the satellites of Jupiter be so regular, if it
was not that the circum-solar force was equally exerted upon Jupiter and
proportion of their several weights. And the same
be said of Saturn in respect of its satellites, and of our earth
spect of the moon, as appears from Cor. II and III, Prop. LXV.

In such bodies as are found on our earth of very different sorts, I exam

and their axes, by a
motion of nutation, twice in every revolution, librate towards their eclip

Cor. 18, Prop. 46 and hence
it
is
that Jupiter, viewed through
very long telescopes, does not appear altogether round (p. 409). but having
its diameter that lies parallel to the ecliptic something longer than that
which is drawn from north to south.
And from the diurnal motion and the attractions (p. 415, 418) of the
Bun and moon our sea ought twice to rise and twice to fall every day, as
well lunar as solar (by Cor. 19, 20, Prop. 46), and the greatest height of the water to happen before the sixth hour of either day and after
the 12th hour preceding.

By the slowness of the diurnal motion the flood is retracted to the 12th hour
and by the force of the motion of 
reciprocation it is protracted and deferred till a time nearer to the sixth
hour.
But till that time is more certainly determined by the pheno
mena, choosing the middle between those extremes, why may we not
conjecture the greatest height of the water to happen at the third hour ?
for thus the water will rise all that time in which the force of the lumi

;
and from the difference of their forces the smallest of
all tides will follow.
And because (as experience tells us) the force of the moon is greater than
that of the sun, the greatest height of the water will happen about the
third lunar hour.

Out of the syzygies and quadratures the greatest tide which by the single force of the moon ought to fall out at the third lunar
hour, and by the single force of the sun at the third solar hour, by the
compounded forces of both must fall out in an intermediate time that ap
proaches nearer to the third hour of the moon than to that of the sun:
and, therefore, while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the quadra
tures, during which time the third hour of the sun precedes the third of
the moon, the greatest tide will precede the third lunar hour, and that by
the greatest interval a little after the octants of the moon and by like
intervals the greatest tide will follow the third lunar hour, while the moon
is passing from the quadratures to the syzygies.

But the motions which we have been describing suffer some alteration
from that force of reciprocation which the waters [having once received]
retain a little while by their vis iiisita ; whence it comes to
pass that the
tides may continue for some time, though the actions of the luminaries
should cease.
This power of retaining the impressed motion lessens the

Besides, all the motions are retarded in their passage through shallow channels, so that the greatest tides of all, in some strai s and mouths are not the

It may also happen that the greatest tide may be the fourth or fifth

Of all which we have an example in the port of Batsham, in the kingdom of Tunquin. in the latitude of 20 50 north.

In the channels of rivers the influx and reflux depends upon the current of the rivers, which obstructs the ingress of the waters from the sea. and
promotes their egress to the sea, making the ingress later and slower, and
the egress sooner arid faster; and hence it is that the reflux is of longer
duration that the influx, especially far up the rivers, where the force of the
is less.
So Sturmy tells us, that in the river Avon, three miles below
sea
and without doubt
Bristol, the water flows only five hours, but ebbs seven
the difference is yet greater above Bristol, as at Carcs/iam or the Bath.

This difference does likewise depend upon the quantity of the flux and re

luminaries more easily overcoming the resistance of the rivers, will make
the ingress of the water to happen sooner and to continue longer, and will
therefore diminish this difference.
But while
the
moon
is
approaching
to
the syzygies, the rivers will be more plentifully filled, their currents being
obstructed by the greatness of the tides, and therefore will something more
retard the reflux of the sea a little after than a little before the syzygies.
Upon which account the slowest tides of all will not happen in the syzy-

Hence also we may collect that the tails arise from the atmospheres of

it
that they are nothing else but
light transmitted through the comets heads, which
they suppose to be transparent others, that they proceed from the refrac

and, lastly, others, that they are a sort of clouds or vapour constantly
rising from the cornets heads, and tending towards the parts opposite to
the sun.
The first is the opinion of such as are yet unacquainted with
optics
;
for the
beams of the sun are not seen
in a darkened room, but in
consequence of the light that is reflected from them by the little particles
of dust and smoke which are always flying about in the air and hence it
is that in air impregnated with thick smoke they appear with greater
;
brightness, and are more faintly and more difficultly seen in a finer air;
but in the heavens, where there is no matter to reflect the light, they are
all.
Light is not seen as it is in the beams, but as it is

this cessation in the latter case is a demonstration of the regular trans

But, to obviate an objection that may be made from the appearing of no

the tails of the fixed stars do not appear, we are to consider that by the
means of telescopes the light of the fixed stars may be augmented above

without any tail, but that comets are seen sometimes
