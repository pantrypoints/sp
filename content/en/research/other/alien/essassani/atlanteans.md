Atlantis was at 10,800 BC but spanned 50,000 years by then. 20,000-30,000 years agao was its prime. 

Atlantis was created by a migration from Lemuria.

Lemuria had remnants when Atlantis was at its height.  

Minoans are an Atlantean colony. 

Noah was Atlantean.

Aztec and Basque have Atlantean DNA.


## Lemuria

Lemurians in South Pacific had blue skin as direct descendants of Anunnaki. 

They were more telepathic and natural.

It was a lush environment and so had few structures. Hawaii was the last remnant of the Mu civilization.

Mu was destroyed naturally by volcanic activity.

Yoga began in Lemurian times.

## Egypt

The Sphinx and Great Pyramids were built in 10,500 BC after the flood to preserve Atlantean knowledge.

The Library of Alexandria had information on Atlantis

The Ten Commandments are in Crystal Tablets that give you information upon touching certain parts. Bashar implies that these are under the Sphinx. 




## Crystal Skulls

These were created during Atlantean times. These represent archetypes and have a lot of information.

Silicon is a good medium to store information.

The Master Skull was the basis for the other skulls.
