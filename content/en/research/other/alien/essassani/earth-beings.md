## Animals

{{< r a="Woman" >}}
How can we communicate with animals?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
Have a deep love for the animals that you will communicate with. Treat them as family with true bonds. 

Then add imagery in your mind, think in pictures of what you want to communicate to them. 
{{< /l >}}


Animals think using pictures, different from humans who think in words. 

Communicate to animals by sending them pictures. 

Orcas are the samurai of the sea.

Dolphinas are alien.
