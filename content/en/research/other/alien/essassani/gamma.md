Different frequencies of consciousness, similar to AM and FM frequency:

1. Beta - waking state


2. Delta - sleeping state

This accesses information in out of body or astral experiences. 

3. Gamma - very high frequency. 

This access higher mind and gives more information holistically in waking state. 

Being in the flow or in the zone is a sign you are in the gamma state. There are many ways to get into the gamma state. Deep breathing is one way. 



## Using Gamma for Education

3 main principles for gamma state learning:

1. safe environment for choices
2. adapt lesson for modality of unitque learning 
3. align information to gamma state and be interactive

Meditative gamma states can help the class learn and absorb information better as long as the lesson matches the gamma state and is interactive.

The teacher also needs to be in gamma state to know how and what to teach.

In Atlantean classes, the teacher would tap a drum to create a rhythm that starts fast then becomes slow. This is their way to use the gamma state for education.


You need to be in the excited state to be inspired.
