## How to Get Over Depression

Get over it!

Do not accept beliefs that devalue you.



## 2 Quick Techniques for Manifesting your Preferred Reality


### First Quick Technique

1. Get a clear Vision or Intention of what you would like your preferred Reality (your preferred Life) to be like.
2. Because you simply exist, you automatically Deserve everything you may want. Accordingly, make sure you feel you Deserve this preferred Reality.
3. What would be the Beliefs of someone already experiencing precisely this Reality?
4. Adopt those Beliefs.
5. When events-contradicting-this-belief come up:
- Do not be in denial. Acknowledge and own these disempowered Beliefs. (Because you can not change what you do not "own".)
- Realize that these disempowered Beliefs and your recently-adopted beliefs are both equally-real, equally-valid, and you contain them both
- With this realization, simply choose to express your preferred recently-adopted beliefs. (Since you already contain ALL beliefs, you don't need to "get rid of" the undesired beliefs. Simply express the preferred beliefs.)
6. Feel the way someone would feel that is already experiencing this preferred Reality.
7. Think the way someone would think that is already experiencing this preferred Reality.
8. Act the way someone would act that is already experiencing this preferred Reality.


### Second Quick Technique - "The Referential Preferential You"

1. Imagine the ideal or divine or perfect or ultimate version of yourself. (If you find this difficult, then imagine your favorite Divine being instead.)
2. In your imagination, put this "ideal you" or "Divine being" into this preferred Reality situation.
3. Watch in your imagination, how the "ideal you" or "Divine being" feels, thinks, and acts in this preferred Reality situation.
4. Simply COPY that behavior:
- Feel the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is feeling in this preferred Reality situation.
- Think the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is thinking in this preferred Reality situation
- Act the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is acting in this preferred Reality situation.

Your imagination is the "pipeline" through which your Higher Self talks to you.


## How to Visualize to manifest what you want

The physical mind is not designed to know:
- HOW something will manifest, or
- what it will look like when it does manifest.

But you can use it to decide what you want.

Your visualization is simply a symbolic representation of a state of being, whose purpose is to generate Excitement within you. But it may not manifest in the form you are visualizing.

### Step 1: You create the most vivid visualization of what you want, that you can
- Get really excited about it

### Step 2: You GIVE that visualization and that excited state of being to your Higher Mind

### Step 3: TOTALLY LET GO of any need that it should manifest in the form you were visualizing
- But hold on to that excited state of being.
- Give the visualization and that excited state of being to your Higher Mind.

<!--  - which does understand HOW that can come into manifestation. -->

Your Higher Mind can produce for you a manifestation that does correspond with the excited state you gave it. But which, in specific form, is much better and more profound than the details of your specific visualization. 

Your Higher Mind can produce a manifestation that is far greater than what the human mind can ever imagine. 

Do not prevent your Higher Mind from giving you something profoundly-better than your visualization, by insisting that it " must " manifest only in the form you are visualizing.

<!-- Remember to Give the visualization to your Higher Mind, and then Let go of the need that it manifest in the form you were visualizing. -->
