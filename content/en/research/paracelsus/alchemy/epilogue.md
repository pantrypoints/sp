Friendly Reader,

I wrote the 12 foregoing Treatises for the sons of Art so that before they may know the operation of Nature.

 <!-- viz. how she produceth things by her working; lest they should attempt to enter in at the gate without keyes, or to draw water in a sieve:  -->

A person labours in vain if he labours without the knowledge of Nature.
- He would be in nocturnal darknesse without the light of the sun.

<!-- to whom the sun doth not shine, and he is in thick darknesse, to whom after it is night the Moon doth not appeare.  -->

Nature has her proper light, which is not obvious to our eyes.

The shadow of Nature is a body before our eyes. 

The light of Nature removes the cloud from his eyes so that he can understand the point of our loadstone which answers to each Center of the beams, viz. of the Sun and Earth.

The light of Nature penetrates and discovers inward things. 

For example, a boy and girl, both 12 years old, are clothed in exactly the same way so that no one can tell which one is male or female. This is because the garments block our eyesight and we take the false things as true. 

But when their garments are taken off, and they are naked, we can see how Nature made them. They are easily distinguished by their sexes. 

In the same way, our intellect sees a shadow of the shadow of Nature. The naked body of Man is the shadow of the seed of Nature.

A man's body is covered with a garment just as man's nature is covered with the body which God reserves to himself to cover, or uncover.

I could here write about the dignity of Man philosophically, his Creation and Generation. But this is impertinent to this place. So I will pass them over in silence. I will only treat a little concerning the Life of Man. 

Man was created of the Earth, and lives by virtue of the Air. There is in the Air a secret food of life, which in the night we call dew.

In the day rarified water, whose invisible, congealed spirit is better then the whole Earth. 

<!-- O holy, and wonderfull Nature, who dost not suffer the sons of Wisdome to erre, as you dost manifest in the life of man daily!  -->

In these 12 Treatises, I have produced so many natural reasons for a person who loves the art and feare God may more easily understand all things.

Through Gods blessing, I have understood them. I write them without any deceit of sophistication: for without the light, and knowledge of Nature, it is impossible to attain to this Art, unless it come to any by Gods speciall revelation, or some special friend privately shews it.

It is a thing of little account, yet most pretious, which being divers times described, I doe now again repeat. 

Take 10 parts of air, 1 part of living gold, or living silver.

Put all these into thy vessel; boil this air first until it be water and then no water. 

If you are ignorant of this, and knowst not how to boyl aire, without all doubt you shalt erre; seeing this is the matter of the ancient Philosophers.

For you must take that, which is, and is not seen, untill it be the Artificers pleasure; it is the water of our dew, out of which is extracted the Salt Petre of Philosophers, by which all things grow, and are nourished: the matrix of it is the Center of the Sun, and Moon, both celestiall, and terrestiall: and to speak more plainly, it is our Loadstone, which in the foregoing Treatises I called Chalybs, or Steel: The air generates this Loadstone, and the Loadstone generates, or makes our Air to appear, and come forth. 

I have here entirely shown you the truth. 

Begge of God that he  would prosper thine undertakings: And so in this place you shalt have the true, and right explication of Hermes, when he saith, that the father of it is the Sun, and its mother the Moon, and that which the wind carryed in its belly, viz. Sal Alkali, which the Philosophers have called Sal Armoniacum, and vegetable, hid in the belly of the Magnesia.

The operation of it is this, to dissolve the congealed aire, in which you shall dissolve the tenth part of Gold; seale this up, and work with our fire, untill the air be turned into powders; and there appear (the salt of the world being first had) divers colours. 

I would have set down the whole processe in these Treatises; but because that, together with the multiplication, is sufficiently set down in the books of Lullius, and other old Philosophers; it therefore sufficed me to treat only of the first, and second matter; which is done faithfully, neither do you ever think that any man living hath done it more cleerly, then I have done it; since I have done it not out of many books but by the labour of my hands, and mine own experience. 

If you do not understand, or believe the truth, do not blame me, but yourself. Perswade yourself that God was unwilling to reveal this secret to you.

Be therefore earnest with him by prayer, and with serious meditation read over this book oftentimes, especially the Epilogue of these twelve Treatises: always considering the possibility of Nature, and the actions of the Elements, and which of them is the chiefest in those actions, and especially in the rarefaction of water, or aire, for so the heavens are created, as also the whole world. 

This I was willing to signifie to thee, as a father to his son. Doe not wonder that I have wrote so many Treatises, for I did not make them for my own sake, seeing I lack not books, but that I might advertise many, that work in fruitlesse things, that they should not spend their costs in vain. 

All things indeed might have been comprehended in few lines, yea in few words: but I was willing to guide thee to the knowledge of Nature by Reasons, and Examples; that you mightest in the[Pg 43] first place know, what the thing is you seekest after, whether the first, or second matter, also that you mightest have Nature, her light, & shadow discovered to thee.

Be not displeased if you meetest sometimes with contradictions in my Treatises, it being the custome of Philosophers to use them; you hast need of them, if you understandest them, you shall not find a rose without prickles. Weigh diligently what I have said before, viz. how four Elements distill into the Center of the earth a radicall moisture, and how the Centrall Sun of the earth, by its motion bringeth it forth, and sublimeth it to the superficies of the earth. 

The Celestial Sun has a correspondency with the Central Sun.

The Celestiall Sun, and the Moon have a peculiar power, and virtue of distilling into the earth by virtue of their beams: for heat is easily joined to heat, and salt to salt.

As the Central Sun has its sea, and crude water, that is perceptible; so the Celestiall Sun hath its sea, and subtill water that is not perceptible. 

In the superficies the beams of the one, are joined to the beams of the other, and produce flowers, and all things. 

Therefore when there is raine made, it receives from the air that power of life, and joins it with the salt-nitre of the earth (because the salt-nitre of the earth is like calcined Tartar, drawing to it self by reason of its drynesse the aire, which in it is resolved into water: such attractive power hath the salt-nitre of the earth, which also was aire, and is joined to the fatnesse of the earth) and by how much the more abundantly the beams of the Sun beat upon it, the greater quantity of salt-nitre is made, and by consequence the greater plenty of Corn grows, and is increased, and this is done daily. 

Thus much I thought good to signifie to the ignorant of the correspondency, or agreement of things amongst themselves, and the efficacy of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars; for the wise need not this instruction. Our subject is presented to the eyes of the whole world, and it is not known. O our Heaven! O our Water! O our Mercury!

O our Salt-nitre abiding in the sea of the world! O our Vegetable! O our Sulphur fixed, and volatill! O our Caput Mortuum, or dead head, or feces of our Sea! Our Water that wets not our hands, without which no mortall can live, and without which nothing grows, or is generated in the whole world! And these are the Epithites of Hermes his bird, which never is at rest. 

It is of very small account, yet no body can bee without it: and so you hast a thing discovered to thee more pretious then the whole world, which I plainly tell thee is nothing else but our Sea water, which is congealed in Silver, and Gold, and extracted out of Gold, and Silver by the help of our Chalybs, by the Art of Philosophers in a wonderfull manner, by a prudent son of Art. 

It was not my purpose for some reasons before mentioned in the Preface, to publish this book, but a desire to deserve well of those that are studiously given to liberall, and Philosophical Arts, prevailed with me, that I might hold forth to them, that I bear an honest mind; also that I might declare my self to them, that understand the Art, to be their equal and fellow, and to have attained their knowledge. 

I doubt not but many men of good consciences, and affections do enjoy this gift of God secretly; these being warned by my example,[Pg 45] and dangers are made more cautious, and wise, having that commendable silence of Harpocrates. For as often as I would discover my self to great men, it always turned to my losse and danger. 

By this my writing I make my self known to the adopted sons of Hermes, I instruct the ignorant, and them that are misled, and bring them back into the right way.

Let the heirs of wisdome know, that they shall never have a better way, then that, which is here demonstrated to them; for I have spoken all things cleerly: Only I have not so cleerly shewed the extraction of our Salt Armoniacke, or the Mercury of Philosophers, out of our Sea water, and the use thereof, because I had from the Master of Nature no leave to speake any further, and this only God must reveale, who knows the hearts, and minds of men. He will haply upon thy constant, and earnest prayers, and the frequent reading over of this booke, open the eyes of thy understanding. 

The vessell is but one from the beginning to the end, or at most two are sufficient.

The fire is continual in both operations; for the sake of which let the ignorant read the tenth, and eleventh Treatise. If you shalt operate in a third matter, you shalt effect nothing: they medle with this, whoever work not in our Salt, which is Mercury, but in Herbs, Animals, Stones, and all Minerals, excepting our Gold, and Silver covered over with the sphere of Saturn.

Whoever wants to attain his desired end, let him understand the conversion of the Elements to make light things heavy, and to make spirits no spirits; then he  shall not worke in a strange thing.

The Fire is the Rule, whatsoever is done, is done by Fire; as sufficiently before, so here we have spoken enough by way of Conclusion. 

<!-- Farewell friendly Reader! and long maist you enjoy these labours of mine, (made good, or verified by mine owne experience,) to the glory of God, the welfare of thine owne soule, and good of thy neighbour. -->
