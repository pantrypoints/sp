All seed is nothing worth of it self, if it be not either by Art, or Nature put into its proper matrix.

Although seed be of it self more noble then every creature, yet the matrix is the life of it, & makes the sperm, or corn to putrefie, and causeth a congealation of the pure point, and also by the heat of its body nourisheth it, and makes it grow: and this is done in all the foresaid Kingdomes of Nature; and is done naturally by months, years, and ages. 

But that is a witty Art, that can shorten any thing in the Minerall, and Vegetable Kingdome, but not in the Animall: in the Minerall Kingdome it perfects that, which Nature could not, by reason of the crude air, which with its vehemency filled the pores of every body; not onely in the bowells, but also in the superficies of the earth. As I have already said in the foregoing Chapters. 

But that this may bee the more easily understood, I will adde hereunto, that the Elements striving amongst themselves send forth their seed into the Center of the earth, as into their reins; but the Center by help of motion sends it into its Matrix. Now the Matrixes are innumerable, as many Matrixes, as places, one purer then other, and so almost in infinitum. 

Know therefore, that a pure Matrix will afford a pure conception in its own likenesse: As for example, in Animalls there are Matrixes of Women, Cowes, Mares, Bitches, and the like. So in the Minerall, and Vegetable Kingdomes, there are metals, Stones, Salts; for the Salts in these two Kingdomes are to bee considered of, as also their places, according to more or lesse.
