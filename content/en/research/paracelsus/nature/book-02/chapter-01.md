It is sufficiently manifest, and knowne to every one, that all naturall things grow, and are ripened through heat, and moisture, which is sufficiently demonstrated by rain, and the heat of the sun. For no man can deny that rain doth make the Earth fruitfull, and it is granted by all, that all fruits are ripened by the sun.

An artificial ripening of things.

Seeing therefore this is by divine ordination naturally possible, who can gain-say, or not beleeve that a man is able, through the wise, and skilfull Art of Alchymie, to make that which is barren, fruitfull, and that which is crude, to ripen, and all things to grow, and to be increased.

God hath subjected all things to man.For the Scripture saith, that God subjected all creatures to man, and put them into his hands as being his own, that he  might use them for his necessity, and rule over the fish of the sea, fowles of the aire, and all things upon the Earth, nothing excepted. 

Wherefore man might well rejoice that God should so endow him with the excellency of Nature, that all the creatures of God should be forced to obey, and be subject to him, especially the whole Earth, and all things which are bred, live, and move in, and upon it. Since therefore wee see with our eyes, and are taught by daily experience, that by how much the oftner, & more abundantly the rain doth moisten the earth, and the sun doth again with its heat and warmth dry it, so much the sooner doe the fruits of the Earth come forth and are ripened, yea all fruits doe cleerly grow, and increase, what time of the yeer soever it be; The artificial generation of fruit.

Let no man henceforth wonder, that the Alchymist also by a manifold imbibition, and distillation should not doe the same. For what else is rain but the imbibition of the Earth? and the heat of the Sun, but the distillation of the Sun, which drawes up those humidities again? Wherefore I say it is possible by such a kind of Art, even in the midle of Winter to bring forth green Herbs, Flowers, and other fruit, through Earth, and Water, out of the seed, and root: 

If then this can bee done in all Herbs, and flowers, it may also bee done in many other like things, as in all mi[Pg 16]neralls, whose imperfect metals by virtue of a minerall water may bee brought to maturity through the industry, and Art of a skilfull Alchymist.


## The ripening of minerals

In like manner may all Marcasites, Granati, Zineta, Arsenica, Talka, Cachymie, Bisemuta, Antimonies, &c. (all which carry with them crude Gold, and Silver,) bee so ripened, that they may bee equalized to the most rich veins of Gold, and Silver, only by this Art. So also the Elixir, and tinctures of metals are brought to maturity, and perfected.

What the growing of the beard of a dead man signifies.
Seeing therefore, as it hath been said, moisture, and heat doe ripen all things, and make them grow, Let none wonder, that the beard, haire, or nailes of a malefactor hanging on a Gibbet, or Wheel do for a long time grow, neither let it be accounted for a sign of his innocency, as the ignorant beleeve, for this is naturall, and from naturall causes. For whilest that any moisture remains in him, his beard, haire, and nailes grow, even till the second year, or till he  bee wholly putrefied, &c.


The augmentation of ☉.

We must also know, that there are many things that grow for ever, and are increased in bignesse, weight, and virtue, in the Water, and Earth, in which they continue good, and efficacious, as are metals, Marcasites, Cachymie, Talka, Granuty, Antimony, Bisemuta, Gemmes, Pearles, Corals, all Stones, and Clay. So also it may be ordered, that Gold may grow, and bee increased in weight, and body, if only it bee buryed in the Earth looking towards the East, and bee always soiled with the fresh urine of a man, and pigeons dung.
