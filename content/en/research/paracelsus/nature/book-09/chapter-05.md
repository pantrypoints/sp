## How Minerals differ

Minerals also, and Metals before they come to the fire have their true signes, and significations, which they have received from the Archeius, and the superiour stars, every one of them resembling some kind of them by distinct colours, and differences of the earth. 

For the Minerall of Gold, is distinct from the Minerall of Silver: so also is the Minerall of Silver from that of Copper: and the Minerall of Copper from that of Iron: so the Minerall of Iron from that of Tinne, and Lead, and so of the rest.

No man can deny, but that the Minerall, and all metallic bodies of Mines, which lie hid in the earth,[Pg 124] may be known by art of Chiromancy by their exteriour signes. That is, the Chiromancy of Mines, Veines, and Conduits, &c. by which not only those things, which being hid within them, are brought forth, but also a certaine depth, and richnesse of the Mine, and plenty of Metall is manifested. 

In this Chiromancy, 3 things are necessary to be known, viz. the age, depth, and breadth of the veins, as hath been said a little before of hearbs. For by how much the older the veins are, by so much the richer, and more augmented are the Mines.

Concerning this we must know thus much, that all Metals, which as yet lie hid in their matrix doe constantly grow.

There are Three chief heads of all things.

Whence also it is manifest, that every thing that growes, although it be placed out of its matrix cannot be made lesse, but forthwith grows, (i.e.) is multiplyed, and according to its substance, measure, and weight, grows untill the predestinated time. Now this predestinated time is the third part, of the appointed age of all Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals, which are the three chief heads of all earthly things.

Now whatsoever doth yet remaine in its matrix, doth grow so long untill the matrix dies. For the matrix hath its appointed time to live, and die, especially if it be subject to externall Elements.

What is the tearme of Elements.
That which is not subject to them, hath no other time, or term then the Elements themselves have, with which it also shall die and perish in the day of Renovation (which is their term.)

Hence it follows, that all things which are within the earth are not subjected to the externall Elements,[Pg 125] neither are they sensible of cold, or moisture, or drynesse, or wind, or aire, by which they may bee destroyed. Such kind of bodies therefore cannot bee putrefied, or contract any filthinesse, or stink, or die, as long as they continue within the earth, in their Chaos.

So much be spoken of Metals, and as of them, so also it may bee said of many men, who in the caves of mountaines live some hundreds of years, as if they were gyants, or pygmies, of which we have wrote a particular book.

But to descend to the practise of the Chiromancy of Mines, which wee shall give you to understand in few words; you must know that the veines by how much the deeper, and broader they are, so much the older. For where the course of the veins is a great way extended, and at length decay, and are not hidden, it is a bad signe. 

For as the courses of the veins doe decay, so also doe the Mines themselves decay, which they signifie by their depth. Although sometimes there are good Mines found, yet by how much the deeper they goe, they doe more, and more decay, so that it is not worth while to worke in them. But when the veins are enlarged with other additions, or oftentimes cut off, it is a good signe, shewing that the Mines are good not only in the top, but that the same also are increased, and multiplyed in depth, and length for the most part, the Mines being made more rich, afford pure gold, and so a most large treasure.

It is without ground, that many Miners commend those veins only which go directly downward, and incline from the East to the West. For the nature of the[Pg 126] Mines and experience teacheth, that veins oftentimes which bend from the West to the East, or from the South to the North, and so contrarily from the North to the South, are not lesse rich then others are. Therefore there is no vein to be esteemed before another. But we think it convenient to discourse of this no longer.

By what signes Mines are discovered.
Now concerning the other signes of the internall earth, as also the colours of Minerals, we shall briefly discourse of them thus.

As oft as Miners fall upon a fat earth, which doth signifie a vein of a pure, and new metall, that is a very good signe assuring that, that Metall, of which it is a vein, is not far off.

So also if the earth that is digged have no Metall in it, but be fat, of a white colour, or black, or like clay or green, or blue, &c. then that also is a good signe of some good Metall that is hid under it. Therefore you must continue digging, and not give over.

Miners in the first place have respect to the excellent, beautiful, and chiefest colours, as are green earth, or Chrysocoll, Verdegrease, Azure, Cinnabar, Sandaracha, Auripigmentum, Litharge of Gold, and Silver, &c. every one of these almost doe for the most part signifie a peculiar Metall, or Minerall.

So Verdegrease, Chrysocolla, green earth, for most part signifie Copper.

So Azure, or white Arsenick, or Litharge of Silver signifie the Metall of Copper.

So Cinnabar, and Sandaracha do sometimes signifie Gold, sometimes Silver, and sometimes a mixture of both.



So Auripigmentum, red Sulphur, and Litharge of Gold, for the most part signifie Gold.

So when Chrysocoll is found mixt with the Azure, or the Azure with Chrysocoll, and Auripigment, for the most part they signifie an excellent and rich Minerall.

Where stones, or earth are found of an Iron colour, they doe certainly betoken an Iron Mine.

You must note, that sometimes it comes to passe, that the Archeius of the earth doth by some secret passage cast up some Metall from the more inward part of the earth. And that is a good signe.

Miners therefore must not bee discouraged when they see such certaine signes, and hope of some excellent Mine lying under. And if thin leaves of Metals, like Talke, do adhere to rocks, or stones, that is a most sure sign.

What Coruscations signifie in Mines.
Now concerning Coruscations they must bee diligently, and studiously observed, for, they are most certain signes of Metals lying hid under them, as also of the same extent, and same kind. Where yet wee must note, that those Metals are not yet come to perfection, but are as yet in their first being. And whither soever the Coruscation reacheth, so far also reacheth the course of Metals, &c.

Coruscations are of three colours.
Moreover you must know, that Coruscation is of a threefold colour, as White, Yellow, and Red, whereby all Metals are discovered to us. For a white Coruscation signifies white Metals, as Tinne, Lead, Silver, &c. a red Coruscation signifies red Metals, as Copper, and Iron, &c. a yellow Coruscation signifies golden Metals.



Add moreover, that a thin, and subtil Coruscation is the best signe.

For as you see it is in trees, that by how much the fewer flowers there are, so much the better, greater, and more savory are the fruit: so also small and subtile Coruscations signifie subtile and excellent Metals, as the contrary doe the contrary.

Moreover you must know, that as long as those Coruscations appear, whether they be great, or small, or of this or that colour, the Metals in those Mines have not yet attained to perfection, but are yet in their first being as the sperm of a man in the matrix of a woman.

What Coruscation is.
But now what Coruscation is, wee must consider in this place: and we must know that it appears in the Mines by night like a sparkling fire, no otherwise then gunpowder that is laid in a long train, and being kindled at one end makes a long flashing.

After the same manner is Coruscation carried along, from the East to the West, or from the West to the East, from the South to the North, or contrarily.

All these Coruscations, how ever they appear, are a certain signe of Courses of Metals, that by them they may be known, and Metals as certain gifts of God may be brought forth out of the earth. For what God created for mans use, he  put that nature into it that it should not be hid: and although it were hid, yet he made peculiar externall signes which conduce to the finding of it out, by which the wonderful predestination of it may be known.

In the same manner if men hide treasures they marke the place with some certain marks, and bury[Pg 129] them by some bound, statue, or fountaine, or any other thing, that when there is occasion they may find, and dig them up again.

How Chaldeans and Grecians hide their treasure.
The ancient Chaldeans and Grecians, if in times of war fearing to be driven away, or banished, they would hide their treasure, would marke the place no otherwise, then propose to themselves a certain day, hour, and minute of the year, and did observe in what place the Sun, or Moon should cast their shadow, and there did bury, and hide their treasure.
