<!-- We must yet further speak of some peculiar signes, of which hitherto we have said nothing. -->

In which Treatise it will be very necessary for you, that boast your selves to have skill in the Art of Signatures, and desire to be called Signators, that you rightly understand mee. For wee shall not in this place write theoretically, but practically, and shall declare our opinion in few words.

What the art of signing is.

The Art of signing teaches how true, and sutable names are to bee put on all things, all which Adam truly knew. 

For presently after the Creation he  gave to every thing its proper name, as to Animals, so to Trees, Hearbs, Rootes, Stones, Minerals, Metals, Waters, &c. And to all the fruits of the earth, Water, Air, Fire, &c. And what names he put upon them all, were ratified, and approved of by God. For from the true, and intrinse[Pg 136]call foundation he tooke them all; not from opinion, or from a predestinated science, viz. the Art of Signing.


## Adam the first signator.

Adam therefore was the first Signator. And it cannot be denyed, that also from the Hebrew tongue true and proper names doe flow, and are put upon every thing according to its nature, and condition.

The nature of the Hebrew tongue.
For what names are put upon them from the Hebrew tongue, doe with the same labour signifie their virtue, power, and property.

So when wee say, this is a Hog, a Horse, a Cow, a Beare, a Dog, a Fox, a Sheep.

The signification of a Hog, Horse, Cow, Beare, Fox, Dog, sheep, in the Hebrew tongue.
The name of a Hog signifies together with it a filthy and unclean Animall: so a Horse signifies a strong and patient Animall: a Cow, a devouring, and insatiable beast: a Bear, a strong, victorious, and an untamed brute: a Fox, a shifting, and crafty beast: a Dog, an animall false to those of his own kind: a Sheep, a mild and profitable beast, and hurtful to none.

Hence it is that a man is called a Hog, for his sordid and swinish life.

And a Horse for his bearing, for which he  is eminent.

And a Cow, because shee is unsatiable with meat, and drink, and knows no measure of her belly.

And a Bear, because he is mishapen, and stronger then other men.

A Fox, because he is a turn-coat, and deceitfull, accommodating himself to all, and offending none.

A Dog, because he is faithfull to none, but his own mouth, is false, and inofficious to all.

And a Sheep, because he  hurts no body but himself, and is usefull to all, rather then to himself, &c.


In what hearbs there is a signature.
After this manner also many Hearbs, and Rootes have got their name.

So Eye-bright is so called, because it cures weak, and sore eyes.

So the Root Bloudwort is so called, because it stops bloud better then any other.

So the Hearb Pile-wort is so called, because it cures the piles better then other hearbs.

The same also may be said of divers other hearbs, of which sort I could reckon a great number, all which were so called from their virtue, and faculty, as shall more largely be declared in our Herball.

Moreover, there bee many Hearbs, and Rootes, which are denominated not only from their imbred virtue, and faculty, but also from their figure, forme, and representation: As, Devills-bit, Five-leaved grasse, or Cinquefoile, Hounds-tongue, Adders-tongue, Horse-taile, Liver-wort, Ox-tongue, Lungwort, the hearb Chameleon, St. Johns-wort, or the hearb boared through, the hearb Dog-stone, Tongue-laurell, Thorow-leafe, Turne-sole, and many others which shall not here, but in the Herball bee severally considered.

What signature there is in Animals.
The same also holds concerning the signes of Animals; for by the bloud, and its circle, and by the urine and its circle all diseases that lie hid in Man may be known.

By the liver of a slain beast the flesh is known whether it be wholsome to be eaten or no. For unlesse the liver be clear, and of a red colour, but blew, or yellow, or rough, or full of holes, the beast is diseased, and therefore his flesh unwholsome.


The Liver the originall of Bloud.
And it is no wonder that the liver can shew that by naturall signes. For the originall of the bloud is in the liver, and hence through the veins it is diffused into the whole body, and is coagulated into flesh.

Therefore from a diseased, and ill affected liver, no sound or fresh bloud can be produced, as of bad bloud no wholsome flesh can be coagulated.

Also without inspection into the liver, flesh and bloud may be known. For if both be sound, they have their true, and naturall colour, which is red, and clear, mixed with no other strange colour, as yellow, or blew. For those strange colours do signifie diseases, and sicknesses.

What the knots in the Navell of the Infant signifie.
Also there are other signes worthy of admiration, viz. when the Archeius is the Signator, and signes the navell in the infant with little knots, by which it may bee conjectured, what the Mother of the infant did bring forth, or shall bring forth.

The branches of a Harts horn signifie his age.
The same Signator signs the horns of a Hart with branches, by which his age is known. For as many branches as the horn hath, so many years old is the Hart. And seeing he hath every year a new horn, the age of the Hart may be known to twenty, or thirty years.

The circles of the hornes of a Cow what.
So the Signator of a Cow markes her hornes with circles, by which it may be known how many Calves shee hath brought forth. For every Circle signifies a Calfe.

The teeth of a Horse.
The same Signator puts forth the first teeth of a Horse, that the first seven yeers his age may be known by his teeth. For at first a Horse is brought forth, with fourteen teeth, of which every yeer he  loseth two, and so in the space of seven yeares he  loseth[Pg 139] all. So that after seven yeares his age can hardly be known, unlesse by one that is very skilful.

The bills and claws of Birds.
The same Signator doth signe the bills and claws of Birds with peculiar signes, that the skilfull Fowler may know their age by them.

The tongues of Hogs.
The same Signator doth marke the tongues of diseased Hogs with little pushes, by which their impurity is known, and as their tongue is impure, so is their whole body.

Colours of Clouds.
The same Signator doth signe clouds with divers colours, by which the seasons of the heaven may bee foreknown.

Colours of the circle of the Moon.
So also he signs the circle of the moon with distinct colours, of which every one is of peculiar interpretation. So redness signifies that there wil be wind; greennesse, and blacknesse, raine, these two mixed together wind and rain, the same in the sea is a signe of great storms, and tempests; clearnesse, and a bright whitenesse is a good sign, especially in the ocean. For, for the most part it signifies a quiet, faire season.

Whatsoever the Moon portends by her signs, shall come to passe the next day.

And so much for Naturall signes. Now for Supernaturall signes, they are things of a particular science, as of Magical Astronomy, &c. and the like. It is therefore necessary that you be skilled in them.

The kinds of Magicall Astronomie.
Hence also many other Arts proceed, as Geomancy, Pyromancy, Hydromancy, Chaomancy, and Necromancy, whereof every one hath its peculiar stars, which stars doe so signe them after a supernaturall manner. And you must know, that the starres of Geomancy impresse their signs upon the earthy bodies of the whole Universe, and that divers wayes. For[Pg 140] they change the earth, and cause earthquakes, and gapings, they produce hills, and valleys, and bring many new Vegetables, they produce also Gamaheaus with naked figures, and images, having wonderfull virtues, and powers, which indeed they receive from the seven planets, as the But or mark receives the arrow from the Archer.

But how those signs, and images of Gamaheaus may be known apart, and what they signifie magically; there is required a great experience, and knowledg of the nature of things, which can by no meanes bee here perfectly taught.

Here you must well note, that the stone, or every Gamaheaus, cannot excell in the property, and virtue but of one star, and so be qualified but by one planet.

And although there bee two or more planets in earthly bodies, as they are joined together in the superiour firmament: yet one is repressed by the other. For as one house cannot bear two Masters, but the one thrusts out the other: so also it is here; the one rules, the other serves: Or as one that overcomes him that keeps any house, casts him out by force; and sets himself, as master of the house, disposing of all things according to his pleasure, and making the other his servant.

So also one starre expells another, one planet another, one Ascendant another, one influence another, one impression another, one Element another; For as water quencheth the fire; so one planet destroyes the property of another, and brings in its owne.

The same is after the same manner to be under[Pg 141]stood of their signes, which are manifold, and not only characters, as many conceive, but all those, which are found in the whole map of the planets, i.e. whatsoever are of affinity with, or subject to the planets.

What things are subject to the Sun.
But that you may the better understand mee by adding an example: I would have you know, that unto the planet of the Sun are subjected a crowne, a scepter, a throne, and all kingly power, majesty, and rule, and all riches, treasures, ornaments, and furniture of this world.

What to the Moone.
Unto the planet of the Moon are subjected all husbandry, navigation, travelling, and travellers, and such things as belong to these.

What to Mars.
Unto the planet of Mars are subjected all fortifications, armour, coats for defence, Ordnance of War, spears, and all weapons, and whatsoever belongs to war.

What to Mercury.
Unto the planet of Mercury are subjected all Artists, all Mechanick instruments, and whatsoever is required to Arts.

What to Iupiter.
Unto the planet of Jupiter are subjected all judgments, and rights, the whole Leviticall order, all Ministers of Churches, ornaments of Temples, all jewells, and such like.

What to Venus.
Unto the planet of Venus are subjected whatsoever things belong to Musick, as Musicall instruments, venereall exercises, loves, whorings, &c.

What to Saturn.
Unto Saturn are subjected whosoever work in and beneath the earth, as Miners, Pioners, Bearers of the dead, Diggers of Wells, as also all instruments serving to either of these, &c.

What be the signes of Pyromancy.

Pyromancy draws forth its signes by the stars of the fire, in common fire by particular sparkes, flames,[Pg 142] or noise, &c. in the mines by Coruscations: in the Firmament by stars, comets, flashing, and lightning, and Nostock, and the like: in Visions by Salamandrine, and fiery spirits.

What the signes of Hydromancy are.

Hydromancy gives its signes by the stars of the Water, by their overflowings, their scarcity, discolourings, commotions, new streames, the washings away of earthy things: in Magick, and Necromancy by Nymphs, visions and supernaturall Monsters in the waters, and sea.

What are the signes of Chaomancy.

Chaomancy shews its signes by the stars of the Aire, and Wind, by the discolouring, destroying of all tender, and subtill things, to which the Wind is an enemie, by beating off the flowers, leaves, boughes, and branches. If the stars of Chaomancy are moved, spirits fall from the superiour Aire, and voices, and answers are often heard: Also Trees are pulled up by the rootes, and Houses are thrown down. There are seen Hobgoblins, Houshold Gods, airy spirits, and Woodmen, &c. also a heavenly dew, and manna fals upon Trees, and Hearbs.

The signes of Necromancy.

Necromancy draws forth its signs by the stars of Death, which we call Evestra, which are prophetical spirits, signing the body of the sick, and dying man with red, blue, and purple spots, which are certaine signs of death, in the third day of their rising. They sign also the hands, and fingers of men with a clay colour, which are certain signs of change, either good or bad. When therfore the stars of Necromancy are moved, then the dead shew some wonderful sign, as Bleeding, and voices are heard out of the graves: tumults, & tremblings arise in the places where bones are laid, and dead men appear in the form, and habit of living[Pg 143] men, and are seen in Visions, in Looking-glasses, in Berills, in Stones, and Waters, and divers shapes. Evestra, i.e. spirits give their signs by beating, striking, knocking, falling, casting, &c. where there is a great hurly burly and noise only heard, but nothing seen, all which are certain signes of death, presaging it to him, in whose habit they appear, or to some in what place they are heard.

Besides, these signatures many more may be reckoned up. But seeing they bring with them, evill, hurtfull and dangerous fancies, and imaginations, and superstitions, which may be an occasion not onely of some misfortune, but also death, I shall passe them over in silence. They are prohibited from being revealed to us, seeing they belong to the schoole of secrets, and divine power. Therefore now I shall put an end to this book.

FINIS.
