The subatomic world is one of rhythm, movement and continual change. It is not, however, arbitrary and chaotic, but
follows very definite and clear patterns. 

To begin with, all particles of a given kind are completely identical; they have xactly the same mass, electric charge, and other characteristic properties. Furthermore, all charged particles carry electric charges exactly equal (or opposite) to that of the electron, or charges of exactly twicethat amount. 

The same is true of other quantities that are characteristic attributes of the particles;
they do not take arbitrary values but are restricted to a limited number, which allows us to arrange the particles into a few distinct groups, or ‘families’. This leads to the question of how these definite patterns arise in the dynamic and ever-changing particle world, 


The emergence of clear patterns in the structure of matter is not a new phenomenon, but was already observed in the
world of atoms. Like subatomic particles, atoms of a given kind are completely identical and the different kinds of atoms,
of chemical elements, have been arranged into several groups in the periodic table. This classification is now well understood;
it is based on the number of protons and neutrons present in the atomic nuclei and on the distribution of the electrons in
spherical orbits, or ‘shells’, around the nuclei. 

The wave nature of the electrons restricts the mutual distance of their orbits and the amount of rotation an
electron can have in a given orbit to a few definite values
corresponding to specific vibrations of the electron waves.

Consequently, definite patterns arise in the atomic structure which are characterized by a set of integral ‘quantum numbers’
and reflect the vibration patterns of the electron waves in their atomic orbits. These vibrations determine the ‘quantum states’ of an atom and ascertain that any two atoms will be completely identical when they are both in their ‘ground state’ or in the same ‘excited state’.

The patterns in the particle world show great similarities to those in the world of atoms. Most particles, for example, spin
about an axis like a top. Their spins are restricted to definite values which are integral multiples of some basic unit. Thus the baryons can only have spins of l/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc., whereas the mesons have spins of 0, 1, 2, etc. This is strongly reminiscent of the amounts of rotation electrons are known to display in their atomic orbits, which are also restricted to definite values specified by integral numbers.

The analogy to the atomic patterns is further enforced by the fact that all strongly interacting particles, or hadrons, seem
to fall into sequences whose members have identical properties except for their masses and spins. The higher members of these
sequences are the extremely short-lived particles called ‘resonances’ which have been discovered in great numbers
over the past decade. The masses and spins of the resonances increase in a well-defined way within each sequence, which
seem to extend indefinitely. 

These regularities suggest an analogy to the excited states of atoms and have led physicists
to see the higher members of a hadron sequence not as different
particles, but merely as excited states of the member with the
lowest mass. Like an atom, a hadron can thus exist in various
short-lived excited states involving higher amounts of rotation
(or spin) and energy (or mass).

The similarities between the quantum states of atoms and hadrons suggest that hadrons, too, are composite objects with
internal structures that are capable of being ‘excited, that is, of absorbing energy to form a variety of patterns. At present,
however, we do not understand how these patterns are formed. 

In atomic physics, they can be explained in terms of the properties and mutual interactions of the atom’s constituents
(the protons, neutrons and electrons), but in particle physics such an explanation has not yet been possible. The patterns found in the particle world have been determined and classified in a purely empirical way and cannot yet be derived from the
details of the particles’ structure. 

The essential difficulty particle physicists have to face lies in the fact that the classical notion of composite ‘objects’ consisting of a definite set of ‘constituent parts’ cannot be applied to subatomic particles. The only way to find out what the
‘constituents’ of these particles are is to break them up by banging them together in collision processes involving high
energies. 

When this is done, however, the resulting fragments are never ‘smaller pieces’ of the original particles. Two protons, for example, can break up into a great variety of fragments when they collide with high velocities, but there will never be
‘fractions of a proton’ among them. The fragments will always be entire hadrons which are formed out of the kinetic energies
and masses of the colliding protons. The decomposition of a particle into its ‘constituents’ is thus far from being definite,
depending, as it does, on the energy involved in the collision process. We are dealing here with a crucially relativistic situation where dynamic energy patterns are dissolved and rearranged, and the static concepts of composite objects and constituent parts cannot be applied to these patterns.

The ‘structure’ of a subatomic particle can only be understood in a dynamic
sense; in terms of processes and interactions. 

The way in which particles break up into fragments in collision processes is determined by certain rules, and as the
fragments are again particles of the same kind, these rules can also be used to describe the regularities which can be observed
in the particle world. In the ‘sixties, when most of the presently known particles were discovered and ‘families’ of particles
began to appear, most physicists-quite naturally-concentrated their efforts on mapping out the emerging regularities,
rather than tackling the arduous problem of finding the dynamic causes of the particle patterns. And in doing so, they were very successful.

The notion of symmetry played an important role in this research. By generalizing the common concept of symmetry and giving it a more abstract meaning, physicists were able to develop it into a powerful tool which proved extremely useful in the classification of particles. In everyday life, the most common case of symmetry is associated with mirror reflection;
a figure is said to be symmetric when you can draw a line through it and thereby divide it into two parts which are exact
mirror images of each other. Higher degrees of symmetry are exhibited by patterns which allow several lines of symmetry
to be drawn, like the following pattern used in Buddhist symbolism.

Reflection, however, is not the only operation associated with symmetry. A figure is also said to be symmetric if it looks the

same after it has been rotated through a certain angle. The
shape of the Chinese yin-yang diagram, for example, is based
on such a rotational symmetry.
In particle physics, symmetries are associated with many
other operations besides reflections and rotations, and these
can take place not only in ordinary space (and time), but also
in abstract mathematical spaces. They are applied to particles,
or groups of particles, and since the particles’ properties are
inseparably linked to their mutual interactions, the symmetries
also apply to the interactions, i.e. to the processes in which
the particles are involved. The reason that these symmetry
operations are so useful lies in the fact that they are closely
related to ‘conservation laws’. Whenever a process in the
particle world displays a certain symmetry, there is a measurable
quantity which is ‘conserved’; a quantity, that is, which
remains constant during the process. These quantities provide
elements of constancy in the complex dance of subatomic
matter and are thus ideal to describe the particle interactions.
Some quantities are conserved in all interactions, others only
in some of them, so that each process is associated with a set
of conserved quantities. Thus the symmetries in the particles’
properties appear as conservation laws in their interactions.
Physicists use tne two concepts interchangeably, referring
sometimes to the symmetry of a process, sometimes to the


corresponding conservation law, whichever is more convenient
in the particular case.
There are four basic conservation laws which seem to be
observed in all processes, three of them being connected with
simple symmetry operations in ordinary space and time. All
particle interactions are symmetric with respect to displace-
ments in space-they will look exactly the same whether they
take place in London or in New York. They are also symmetric
with respect to displacements in time, which means they will
occur in the same way on a Monday or on a Wednesday. The
first of these symmetries is connected with the conservation
of momentum, the second with the conservation of energy.
This means that the total momentum of all particles involved
in an interaction, and their total energy (including all their
masses), will be exactly the same before and after the inter-
action. The third basic symmetry is one with respect to orienta-
tion in space. In a particle collision, for example, it does not
make any difference whether the colliding particles approach
each other along an axis oriented north-south or east-west.
As a consequence of this symmetry, the total amount of rotation
involved in a process (which includes the spins of the individual
particles) is always conserved. Finally, there is the conservation
of electric charge. It is connected with a more complicated
symmetry operation, but in its formulation as a conservation
law it is very simple: the total charge carried by all particles
involved in an interaction remains constant.
There are several more conservation laws which correspond
to symmetry operations in abstract mathematical spaces, like
the one connected with charge conservation. Some of them
hold for all interactions, as far as we know, others only for
some of them (e.g. for strong and electromagn.etic
interactions,
but not for weak interactions). The corresponding conserved
quantities can be seen as ‘abstract charges’ carried by the
particles. Since they always take integer values (, _+ 1, + 2, etc.),
or ‘half-integer’ values (f l/2, f 3/2, + 5/2, etc.), they are called
quantum numbers, in analogy to the quantum numbers in
atomic physics. Each particle, then, is characterized by a set
of quantum numbers which, in addition to its mass, specify its
properties completely.

Hadrons, for example, carry definite values of ‘isospin’ and


‘hypercharge’, two quantum numbers which are conserved in
all strong interactions. If the eight mesons listed in the table in
the previous chapter are arranged according to the values of
these two quantum numbers, they are seen to fall into a neat
hexagonal pattern known as the ‘meson octet’. This arrange-
ment exhibits a great deal of symmetry; for example, particles
and antiparticles occupy opposite places in the hexagon, the
two particles in the centre being their own antiparticles. The
eight lightest baryons form exactly the same pattern which is
called the baryon octet. This time, however, the antiparticles
are not contained in the octet, but form an identical ‘anti-octet’.
The remaining baryon in our particle table, the omega, belongs
to a different pattern, called the ‘baryon decuplet’, together
with nine resonances. All the particles in a given symmetry
pattern have identical quantum numbers, except for isospin
and hypercharge which give them their places in the pattern.
For example, all mesons in the octet have zero spin (i.e. they
do not spin at all); the baryons in the octet have a spin of l/2,
and those in the decuplet have a spin of 3/2.

The quantum numbers, then, are used to arrange particles
into families forming neat symmetric patterns, to specify the
places of the individual particles within each pattern, and at
the same time to classify the various particle interactions
according to the conservation laws they exhibit. The two related
concepts of symmetry and conservation are thus seen to be
extremely useful for expressing the regularities in the particle
world.


It is surprising that most of these regularities can be repre-
sented in a very simple way if one assumes that all hadrons are
made of a small number of elementary entities which have so
far eluded direct observation. These entities have been given
the fanciful name ‘quarks’ by Murray Cell-Mann who referred
his fellow physicists to the line in James Joyce’s Finnegan’s
Wake, ‘Three quarks for Muster Mark’, when he postulated
their existence. Cell-Mann succeeded in accounting for a
large number of hadron patterns, such as the octets and the
decuplet discussed above, by assigning appropriate quantum
numbers to his three quarks and their antiquarks, and then
putting these building blocks together in various combinations
to form baryons and mesons whose quantum numbers are
obtained simply by adding those of their constituent quarks.
In this sense, baryons can be said to ‘consist of’ three quarks,
their antiparticles of the corresponding antiquarks, and
mesons of a quark plus an antiquark.
The simplicity and efficiency of this model is striking, but it
leads to severe difficulties if quarks are taken seriously as actual
physical constituents of hadrons. So far, no hadrons have ever
been broken up into their constituent quarks, in spite of
bombarding them with the highest energies available, which
means that quarks would have to be held together by extremely
strong binding forces. According to our present understanding
of particles and their interactions, these forces can only manifest
themselves through the exchange of other particles, and
consequently these other particles, too, would be present
inside each hadron. If this were so, however, they would also
contribute to the hadron’s properties and thus destroy the
simple additive scheme of the quark model.
In other words, if quarks are held together by strong inter-
action forces, these must involve other particles and the quarks
must consequently show some kind of ‘structure’, just like all
the other strongly interacting particles. For the quark model,
however, it is essential to have pointlike, structureless quarks.
Because of this fundamental difficulty, it has so far not been
possible to formulate the quark model in a consistent dynamic
way which accounts for the symmetries and for the binding
forces.
On the experimental side, there has been a fierce but, so

far, unsuccessful ‘hunt for the quark over the past decade.
If single quarks exist, they should be quite conspicuous because
Cell-Mann’s model requires them to possess some very unusual
properties, like electric charges of l/3 and 2/3 of that of the
electron, which do not appear anywhere in the particle world.
So far, no particles with these properties have been observed
in spite of the most intensive search. This persistent failure to
detect them experimentally, plus the serious theoretical ob-
jections to their existence, have made the reality of quarks
extremely doubtful.
On the other hand, the quark model continues to be very
successful in accounting for the regularities found in the
particle world, although it is no longer used in its original
simple form. In Cell-Mann’s original model, all hadrons could
be built from three kinds of quarks and their antiquarks, but in
the mean time physicists have had to postulate additional
quarks to account for the great variety of hadron patterns.
Cell-Mann himself recently proposed that each quark can
appear in three different varieties which he called-most
appropriately in a lecture in Paris-‘red, white, and blue quarks’.
This increased the total number of quarks to nine, and since
then three more quarks have been postulated,* which allowed
one of the speakers at a recent physics conference to refer to
them facetiously as ‘the twelve observed quarks’.
The great number of regularities that can be successfully
described in terms of these twelve quarks is truly impressive.
There can be no doubt that hadrons exhibit ‘quark symmetries’,
even though our present understanding of particles and inter-
actions precludes the existence of physical quarks. At present,
in the summer of 1974, the paradoxes surrounding the quark
model are becoming increasingly sharp. A great deal of experi-
mental data support the quark model; others contradict it
violently. No one has ever seen a quark, and according ‘to our
basic ideas about particle interactions quarks cannot exist. Yet,
hadrons very often behave exactly as if they consisted of
pointlike elementary constituents. This situation is strongly
reminiscent of the early days of atomic physics when equally
striking paradoxes led the physicists to a major breakthrough

in their understanding of atoms. The quark puzzle has all the
traits of a new koan which, in turn, could lead to a major
breakthrough in our understanding of subatomic particles.
The discovery of symmetric patterns in the particle world has
led many physicists to believe that these patterns reflect the
fundamental laws of nature. During the past fifteen years, a
great deal of effort has been devoted to the search for an
ultimate ‘fundamental symmetry’ that would incorporate all
known particles and thus ‘explain’ the structure of matter. This
aim reflects a philosophical attitude which has been inherited
from the ancient Greeks and cultivated throughout many
centuries. Symmetry, together with geometry, played an
important role in Greek science, philosophy and art, where it
was identified with beauty, harmony and perfection. Thus the
Pythagoreans regarded symmetric number patterns as the
essence of all things; Plato believed that the atoms of the four
elements had the shapes of regular solids, and most Greek
astronomers thought that the heavenly bodies moved in circles because the circle was the geometrical figure with the highest degree of symmetry.

The attitude of Eastern philosophy with regard to symmetry is in striking contrast to that of the ancient Greeks. 

Mystical traditions in the Far East frequently use symmetric patterns as symbols or as meditation devices, but the concept of symmetry does not seem to play any major role in their philosophy. Like geometry, it is thought to be a construct of the mind, rather than a property of nature, and thus of no fundamental importance. 

Accordingly, many Eastern art forms have a striking predilection for asymmetry and often avoid all regular or geometrical shapes. The Zen-inspired paintings of China and Japan, often executed in the so-called ‘one-corner’ style, or the irregular arrangements of flagstones in Japanese gardens clearly illustrate this aspect of Far-Eastern culture.

It would seem, then, that the search for fundamental symmetries in particle physics is part of our Hellenic heritage which is, somehow, inconsistent with the general world view that begins to emerge from modern science. The emphasis on symmetry, however, is not the only aspect of particle physics.

In contrast to the ‘static’ symmetry approach, there has always been a ‘dynamic’ school of thought which does not regard the particle patterns as fundamental features of nature, but attempts to understand them as a consequence of the dynamic nature and essential interrelation of the subatomic world. The remaining two chapters show how this school of thought has given rise, in the past decade, to a radically different view of symmetries and laws of nature which is in harmony with the
world view of modern physics described so far and which is in
perfect agreement with Eastern philosophy.
