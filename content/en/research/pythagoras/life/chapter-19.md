Universally, Pythagoras discovered many paths of learning. 

He delivered wisdom conformable to the proper nature and power of each. The following is an example. 

Abaris, an old Scythian, came from the Hyperboreans, unskilled and uninitiated in the Grecian learning. 

Pythagoras tested him and immediately considered him adapted to be an auditor of his dogmas.  <!-- did not introduce him to erudition through various theorems, but instead of silence, auscultation for so long a time, and --> 

He instructed him in the shortest way in his:
- treatise On Nature, and 
- treatise On the Gods. 

Abaris was a priest of Apollo. He was returning from Greece to his own country to consecrate the gold to Apollo in his temple among the Hyperboreans. 

<!--  who is there worshipped, an elderly man, and most wise in sacred concerns; but at that time he was returning from Greece to his own country, in order that he might  -->

He passed through Italy and saw Pythagoras. He believed that Pythagoras was truly Apollo. <!-- the God of whom he was the priest. --> 

<!-- And believing that he was no other than the God himself, and that no man resembled him, but that he was truly Apollo,  both from the venerable indications which he saw about him, and from those which the priest had known before,  -->

He gave Pythagoras a dart which he took with him when he left the temple, as a thing that would be useful to him in the difficulties that would befall him in so long a journey.

The dart helped him pass through inaccessible places, such as rivers, lakes, marshes, mountains, and the like. Through the dart, he did lustrations and expelled pestilence and winds from the cities that requested him to liberate them from these evils. 

After Sparta was purified by him, it was no longer infested with pestilence which it frequently had because of <!-- . , though prior to this it had frequently fallen into this evil, through the baneful --> the nature of where it was built. 

The mountains of Taygetus produced a suffocating heat in the same way as Cnossus in Crete. 

Many other similar particulars are related of the power of Abaris. 

Pythagoras, however, received the dart. 

He was not astonished at the novelty of the thing, nor asked why it was given to him.

Instead, as if he was a God himself, took Abaris aside. He showed him his golden thigh, as an indication that he was not wholly deceived in the opinion he had formed of him.

Having enumerated to him the several particulars that were deposited in the temple, he gave him sufficient reason to believe that he had not badly conjectured in assimilating him to Apollo. 

Pythagoras added that he came to those pestilential places to remedy them.

This is why he had assumed a human form, lest men being disturbed by the novelty of his transcendency, should avoid the discipline which he possessed.

He exhorted Abaris to:
- remain there and to unite with him in correcting the lives and manners of those who they might meet.
- share the gold which he had collected, in common with his associates, who were led by reason to confirm by their deeds the dogma, that the possessions of friends are common. 

Thus, Pythagoras unfolded to Abaris, who remained with him physiology and theology in a compendious way. 

Instead of divination by the entrails of beasts, he delivered to him the art of prognosticating through numbers, conceiving that this was purer, more divine, and more adapted to the celestial numbers of the Gods. 

He delivered also to Abaris other studies which were adapted to him.

That we may return, however, to that for the sake of which the present treatise was written, Pythagoras endeavoured to correct and amend different persons, according to the nature and power of each. 

All such particulars therefore as these, have neither been transmitted to the knowledge of men, nor is it easy to narrate all that has been transmitted to us concerning him.
