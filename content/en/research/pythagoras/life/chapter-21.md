After learning together, they turned their attention to bodily health. 

Most of them, however, used unction and the course. Fewer did wrestling in gardens and groves. Others strengthened the body by leaping with leaden weights in their hands, or in pantomime gesticulations.

 <!-- with a view to , studiously selecting for this purpose opposite exercises.  -->

In the evening they again walked outside, not alone as in the morning walk, but in parties of two or three. They would remember the disciplines they had learnt as they walked.

Afterwards, they took a bath. They then ate together with a maximum of 10 people.

Their dinner consisted of bread and honey or the honey-comb. They did not drink wine during the day.

They used the time after dinner to trade with strangers and guests, conformably to the mandate of the laws. They wished to transact all business of this kind after dinner.

These, however, being collected together, libations and sacrifices were performed with fumigations and frankincense. After this they went to supper, which they finished before the setting of the sun. But they made use of wine and maze, and bread, and every kind of food that is eaten with bread, and likewise raw and boiled herbs. 

The flesh of such animals was placed before them as it was lawful to immolate. They rarely ate fish as it was not useful to them.

They believed that animals which are not naturally noxious to the human race should neither be injured nor slain. 

But after this supper, libations were performed. These were succeeded by readings.
- The eldest ordered what was to be read and how
- The youngest would read 

When they were about to depart, the cup-bearer poured out a libation for them. The eldest would then announce the following precepts: That a mild and fruitful plant should neither be injured nor corrupted, nor in a similar manner, any animal which is not noxious to the human race. 

<!-- It is necessary to speak piously and form proper conceptions of the divine, dæmoniacal, and heroic genera; and in a similar manner, of parents and benefactors. That it is proper likewise to give assistance to law, and to be hostile to illegality.  -->

Aftewards, each person went home. They wore a white and pure garment. They slept on pure and white beds, the coverlets of which were made of thread. They did not use woollen coverlets. They did not approve of hunting. 

<!-- Such therefore were the precepts which were daily delivered to the disciples of Pythagoras, with respect to nutriment and their mode of living. -->
