Aristæus was the successor of Pythagoras. 

He was the son of Damophon the Crotonian, who lived at the same time as Pythagoras, was seven ages prior to Plato.

Aristæus was eminently skilled in the Pythagoric dogmas. This made him:
- worthy to succeed Pythagoras in his school,
- educate his children,
- marry his wife Theano

Pythagoras himself taught in Aristaeus' school.  <!-- forty years wanting one, and to have lived nearly 100 years. --> But Aristæus, when much advanced in 189 years, relinquished the school.

After him, Mnesarchus, the son of Pythagoras, succeeded. 

Bulagoras succeeded Mnesarchus, in whose time it happened that the city of the Crotonians was plundered. 

Gartydas the Crotonian succeeded Bulagoras, on his return from a journey which he had undertaken prior to the war.

Because of the calamity of his country, he suffered so much anxiety and died prematurely through grief. 

But it was the custom with the Pythagoreans to liberate themselves when they became very old from the body as from a prison.

Some time after, Aresas Lucanus was saved through certain foreigners and managed the school. To him came Diodorus Aspendius, who was received into the school, on account of the paucity of the Pythagoreans it contained. 

In Heraclea were Clinias and Philolaus. But at Metapontum, Theorides and Eurytus. At Tarentum Archytas. 

Epicharmus was one of the foreign auditors. But that he was not one of the school. 

Having however arrived at Syracuse, he abstained from philosophizing openly, on account of the tyranny of Hiero. But he inserted the conceptions of the men in metre, and published in comedies the occult dogmas of Pythagoras.
