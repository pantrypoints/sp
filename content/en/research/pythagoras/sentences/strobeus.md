These have been omitted in the Opuscula Mythologica, etc. of Gale.

Do not even think of doing what should not be done. Choose rather to be strong in soul than in body.

Be persuaded that things of a laborious nature contribute more than pleasures to virtue.

Every passion of the soul is most hostile to its salvation. It is difficult to walk at one and the same time in many paths of life.[77]

Pythagoras said that we should choose the most excellent life, for custom will make it pleasant. 

Wealth is not a firm anchor. Glory is even less firm and in a similar manner the body, 260 dominion, and honor. All of these are imbecile and powerless. 

What then are powerful anchors? 

They are:
- prudence
- magnanimity
- fortitude

These no tempest can shake. The law of God is that:
- virtue is the only strong thing
- everything else is a trifle.

All the parts of human life should be beautiful, like the parts of a statue.

A statue stands on its foundation. A worthy man stands on his deliberate choice and should be immovable.

Frankincense should be given to the Gods, but praise to good men.

We should defend those who are unjustly accused of having acted injuriously. But we should praise those who excel in a certain good.

Remind yourself that all men assert that wisdom is the greatest good, but that there are few who strenuously endeavour to obtain this greatest good.[79] Pythagoras.

Be sober and be disposed to believe; for these are the nerves of wisdom. Epicharmus.

It is better to live lying on the grass, confiding in divinity and yourself, than to lie on a golden bed with perturbation.

You will not be in want of any thing, which it is in the power of Fortune to give and take away.[80]

Despise all those things, which when liberated from the body you will not want; and exercising yourself in those things of which when liberated from the body you will be in want, invoke the Gods to become your helpers.[81]

Neither is it possible to conceal fire in a garment, nor a base deviation from rectitude in time.

Wind indeed increases fire, but custom love.[82]

Those alone are dear to divinity, who are hostile to injustice.[83]

Those things which the body necessarily requires, are easily to be procured by all men, without labor and molestation; but those things to the attainment of which labor and molestation are requisite, are objects of desire, not to the body, but to depraved opinion. Aristoxenus Pythag. Stob. p. 132.

Of desire also, he [i. e. Pythagoras] said as follows= This passion is various, laborious, and very multiform. Of desires however, some are acquired and adventitious, but others are connascent. But he defined desire itself to be a certain tendency and impulse of the soul, and an appetite of a plenitude or presence of sense, or of an emptiness and absence of it, and of non-perception.

He also said, that there are three most known species of erroneous and depraved desire, viz. the indecorous, the incommensurate, and the unseasonable. 

For desire is either immediately indecorous, troublesome, and illiberal; or it is not absolutely so, but is more vehement and lasting than is fit. Or in the third place, it is impelled when it is not proper; and to objects to which it ought not to tend. <!-- Ex Aristoxeni Pythag. Sententiis. Stob. p. 132 -->.

The grace of freedom of speech, like beauty in season, is productive of greater delight.

It is not proper either to have a blunt sword, or to use freedom of speech ineffectually.

Neither is the sun to be taken from the world, nor freedom of speech from erudition.

As it is possible for one who is clothed with a sordid robe, to have a good habit of body; thus also he whose life is poor may possess freedom of speech.[84]

Be rather delighted with those that reprove, than with those that flatter you; but avoid flatterers, as worse than enemies. Pythagoras. Stob. p. 149.

The life of the avaricious resembles a funeral banquet. For though it has all things [requisite to 264 a feast,] yet no one present rejoices. Stob. p. 155.[85]

Travelling teaches a man frugality, and the way in which he may be sufficient to himself. For bread made of milk and flower, and a bed of grass, are the sweetest remedies of hunger and labor.

To the wise man every land is eligible as a place of residence; for the whole world is the country of the worthy soul.[86] Stob. p. 231.
