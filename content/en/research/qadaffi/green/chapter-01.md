The instrument of government is the prime political problem confronting human communities (The problem of the instrument of government entails questions of the following kind.

What form should the exercise of authority assume? How ought societies to organize themselves politically in the modern
world?)

Even conflict within the family is often the result of the failure to resolve this problem of authority. It has clearly become more serious with the emergence of modern societies.

People today face this persistent question in new and pressing ways. Communities are exposed to the risks of uncertainty, and suffer the grave consequences of wrong answers. Yet none has
succeeded in answering it conclusively and democratically. 

THE GREEN BOOK presents the ultimate solution to the problem of the proper instrument of government.
All political systems in the world today are a product of the struggle for power between alternative instruments of government. 

This struggle may be peaceful or armed, as is evidenced among classes, sects, tribes, parties or individuals. The outcome
is always the victory of a particular governing structure – be it
that of an individual, group, party or class – and the defeat of
the people; the defeat of genuine democracy.

Political struggle that results in the victory of a candidate
with, for example, 51 per cent of the votes leads to a dictatorrial governing body in the guise of a false democracy, since 49 per cent of the electorate is ruled by an instrument of government they did not vote for, but which has been imposed upon them. 

Such is dictatorship. Besides, this political conflict may
produce a governing body that represents only a minority. For
when votes are distributed among several candidates, though
one polls more than any other, the sum of the votes received by
those who received fewer votes might well constitute an overwhelming majority. However, the candidate with fewer votes
wins and his success is regarded as legitimate and democratic!

In actual fact, dictatorship is established under the cover of false
democracy. This is the reality of the political systems prevailing
in the world today. They are dictatorial systems and it is evident
that they falsify genuine democracy.
