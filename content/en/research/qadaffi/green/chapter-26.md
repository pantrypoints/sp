Education, or learning, is not necessarily that routinized curriculum and those classified subjects in textbooks which youths are forced to learn during specified hours while sitting in rows of desks.

This type of education now prevailing all over the world is directed against human freedom.

State-controlled education, which governments boast of whenever they are able to force it on their youths, is a method of suppressing freedom.

It is a compulsory obliteration of a human being’s talent, as well as a coercive directing of a human being’s choices. 

It is an act of dictatorship destructive of freedom because it deprives people of their free choice, creativity and brilliance. 

To force a human being to learn according to a set curriculum is a dictatorial act. To impose certain subjects upon people is also a dictatorial act.

State-controlled and standardized education is, in fact, a forced stultification of the masses. 

All governments which set courses of education in terms of formal curricula and force people to learn those courses coerce their citizens. 

All methods of education prevailing in the world should be destroyed through a universal cultural revolution that frees the human mind from curricula of fanaticism which dictate a process of deliberate distortion of man’s tastes, conceptual ability and mentality.

This does not mean that schools are to be closed and that people should turn their backs on education, as it may seem to superficial readers. 

On the contrary, it means. that society should provide all types of education, giving people the chance to choose freely any subjects they wish to learn. This requires a sufficient number of schools for all types of education. 

Insufficient numbers of schools restrict human freedom of choice, forcing them to learn only the subjects available, while depriving them of the natural right to choose because of the unavailability of other subjects. 

Societies which ban or monopolize knowledge or the teaching of religion are reactionary societies.
- These are biased towards ignorance and are hostile to freedom. 

<!-- Societies which prohibit  are reactionary societies, biased towards ignorance and hostile to freedom. Societies which monopolize religious education are reactionary societies, biased towards ignorance and hostile to freedom.  -->

Equally so are the societies which distort the religions, civilizations and behaviour of others in the process of teaching those subjects. Societies which consider materialistic knowledge taboo are likewise reactionary societies, biased towards ignorance and hostile to freedom.

Knowledge is a natural right of every human being of which no one has the right to deprive him or her under any pretext, except in a case where a person does something which deprives him or her of that right.

Ignorance will come to an end when everything is presented
as it actually is and when knowledge about everything is available to each person in the manner that suits him or her.
