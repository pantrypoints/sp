Humans, being backward, are still unable to speak one common language. 

Until this human aspiration is attained, which seems impossible, the expression of joy and sorrow, of what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, comfortable and miserable, mortal and eternal, love and hatred, the description of colours, sentiments, tastes and moods – all will be expressed according to the language each person speaks spontaneously. Behaviour itself will result from the reaction produced by the feeling that the language creates in the speaker’s mind.

Learning a single language, whatever it may be, is not the solution for the time being.

It is a problem that will inevitably remain without solution until the process of the unification of languages has passed through time, provided that the hereditary factor loses its effect on subsequent generations through the passage of sufficient time.

The sentiment, taste and mood of ancestors form those of their descendants. 

If those ancestors spoke different languages and their children, on the contrary, speak a single language, the off-spring would not necessarily share common tastes in virtue of speaking a common language. 

Such common tastes can be achieved only when the new language imparts the taste and the sense transmitted by inheritance from one generation to another.

If one group of people wears white clothes in mourning and another group puts on black, the sentiment of each group will be adjusted according to these two colours, i.e., one group rejects the black colour on such an occasion while the other one prefers it, and vice versa.

Such a sentiment leaves its physical effect on the cells as well as on the genes in the body. 

This adaptation, will be transmitted by inheritance. The inheritors automatically reject the colour rejected by the legator as a result of inheriting the sentiment of their legator. Consequently, people are only harmonious with their own arts and heritage.

They are not harmonious with the arts of others because of heredity, even though those people, who differ in heritage, speak a single common language. Such a difference emerges between the groups of one people, even if it is on a small scale.

To learn a single language is not the problem, and to understand others’ arts as a result of learning their language is also not the problem. The problem is the impossibility of a real intuitional adaptation to the language of others. 

This will remain impossible until the effects of heredity, which are transmitted in the human body, come to an end. Mankind is still backward because humans do not communicate in one inherited common language. It is only a matter of time before mankind, achieves that goal, unless civilization should relapse.
