The divisions of the fingers are the 3 joints or phalanxes.

The nail phalanx is always referred to as the first (see plate 14, the marked A) the middle division as the second (see plate 14, the joints marked B) the one nearest the palm, the third (see plate divide the 14, the joints marked C). 

The phalanxes can be roughly divided to show:

1. Mental qualities [top part of the finger]

Persons with long first phalanxes are most active in the mental field. 

2. Practical and business qualities [middle part of the finger]

When the second phalanx is longest and largest, the practical and business side will be uppermost. 

3. Physical qualities [lower part of the finger]

When the third phalanx leads, I have found the subject greatly absorbed in the physical side of life.


## The Jupiter Finger

The Jupiter (see plate 9), indicates ambition, love of and also devoutness. 

When this finger is the dominant one (see plate 15), some or all these qualities will, in varying degree, be strong motivations.

When the finger is very inflexible, cruelty and tyranny may be added to the qualities of leadership.

If the Jupiter finger is hooked, the ambition will be a selfish one, and the person might not be overscrupulous in his choice of means.

A very thin and nervous index finger, even though long, does not mean purposeful ambition or leadership. Rather does it indicate the frustrated wish for power, realized only in daydreams. 

Of course, the first phalanx and the fingertip modify the general meaning of a long first finger. 

A pointed tip on the first finger denotes intuition especially if the inside surf ace is very full.

A square tip shows love of truth.

A spatulate tip shows bigotry.

An oval tip shows refinement.

A long nail phalanx emphasizes intuition. 

A short first phalanx indicates the skeptic. 

Thickness of Jupiter's first phalanx implies sensual qualities, and a thin nail phalanx on the first finger indicates austere rigidity.

A middle phalanx shows:
- determination when it is long
- lack of energy when it is short
- selfishness when it is thick
- honors, rather than riches, as the spur of ambition, when it is thin.

A long base phalanx on the index finger is a sign of love of power.

A short one, of modesty and resignation. 

Thickness here shows sensuality or gluttony; slenderness, control of the appetites.


## The Saturn Finger

The second finger is the middle finger called the Saturn finger (see plate 9) which governs thought.

When this finger is the dominant one (see 16 plate 16), towering above its two neighbors, our subject is likely to be serious and given to solitude.

He may have humor, but it is probably of a satiric nature. 

A weak second finger, whether unusually short or abnormally thin, shows frivolity or lack of concentration.

If the nail phalanx of the Saturn finger (see plate 14, 2A) is long and tapering, he is cautious, persistent, and sincere.

If the tip is pointed, look for lightness. 

When it is square, expect a serious person with sound judgment.

A spatulate tip on the Saturn finger shows the pessimist. 

A short first phalanx indicates the fatalist.

A thick one, carelessness; a very thin one, cruelty.

The middle phalanx on the Saturn finger (see plate 14, 2B) shows
- precision and a scientific approach if it is long
- credulity and a mystical bent when it is short
- great physical energy and capacity for manual labor when it is thick
- philosophic logic and exactness when it is thin

<!-- A long base -->


The base phalanx on the middle finger (see plate 14, 2C) shows:
- love of solitude when it is short
- lack of control in giving either as meanness or overgenerosity when short
- materialistic and plodding temperament if thick
- miserliness if thin

Thus, a short, thin base phalanx on the Saturn finger would certainly indicate meanness rather than overgenerosity.

## The Apollo Finger

The third finger is the Apollo (see plate 9). It governs sociability, the arts, and self-esteem.

This is an excellent sign for actors, singers, and those who seek careers in the applied arts.

The top phalanx in this finger (see plate 14, 3 A) has many connotations, depending on its size and shape. 

Bent back, it indicates appreciation of beauty. This appreciation takes on a formal quality when the phalanx is thin, a hint of sensuality if it is thick.

A pointed tip on the Apollo finger signifies a tendency towards mysticism and a clinging to false values in judgment. 

A short phalanx shows simplicity.

A long one, eccentricity, a seeking after queer, sometimes unattainable objectives. With an oval tip, I have usually found ease in speech, sometimes lack of discretion. 

A square tip shows a positive, certain nature; a spatulate shows 

The middle phalanx in the Apollo finger (see plate 14, 3B) is extremely important for those in creative fields, for it shows creative ability when it is short.

Thickness goes with originality.

The base phalanx of the Apollo finger (see plate 14, 3C) indicates  the realist if it is short, the coxcomb if it is long. Thickness in this phalanx bespeaks a sense of dramatics and a love of color; a thin, waisted shape, indifference, lack of enthusiasm.
