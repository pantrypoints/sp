The fourth, or little finger, is called the finger of Mercury (see plate 9). 

This governs business abilities and the faculty of speech, whether written or oral. 

The tip of this finger shows:
- inventiveness and restlessness, an active and resourceful nature, when it has a spatulate shape
- common sense when it is square
- visionary metaphysical strain, when it is pointed
- refinement, a formal sense of values when it is oval

If Mercury's top phalanx is hooked, it indicates a self-centered, not overscrupulous person.

When it is bent  back, you will find someone who is inquisitive and talkative. 

Length in this phalanx shows love of study, though usually study of a practimental laziness.

Thickness is a sign of lack of delicacy.

A very thin middle phalanx in the little finger (see plate 14, 4B) gives us the gambler, or a very ambitious person who is impatient of the usual methods of fulfilling his ambitions. 

A long middle phalanx indicates a commercial or legal bent. 

A short middle phalanx shows loyalty.

When the base phalanx of the Mercury finger (see plate 14, 4C) is long, look for eloquence and cunning.

When it is short, a straightforward, credulous nature.

If this phalanx is thick, you have an indication of sex complexes; thin, of a precise, analytical mind.


## How To Interpret The Fingers

The fingers indicate special talents and aptitudes.

They are most important in applying hand to vocational analysis guidance or training. 

The indications of the fingers must, however, be read in conjunction with the information revealed by the hand as a whole and by the lines and markings in the palm. 

For example, when a very long base on the finger of Mercury, the little finger, indicates eloquence and cunning, and you find that other signs show a timid, retiring nature, you may be sure you have a potential demagogue, but one who is likely to remain anonymous, appealing through the written word, or possibly making no use at all of his gift of eloquence. Thus, the various contradictory evidences must be balanced against one another. 

<!-- fingers, indicating as of the person -->

You should accept as keynotes to the personality you are studying only the strong traits or those which are consistently indicated throughout the entire hand.
