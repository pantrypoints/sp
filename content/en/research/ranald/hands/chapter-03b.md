## The Base Phalanx Of The Thumb

The base phalanx of the thumb (see plate 14, TH-C) governs affection and the  senses.

When this section is long, these attributes are strong, and, if the phalanx is at the same time thin, the passions will be under control.

Fleshiness in this portion of the hand indicates self indulgence, egotism, love of domination, and a tendency to exploit others.

A normal development of the thumb's base phalanx gives us well-balanced control, an affectionate disposition, and a sense of fair-play.


## Shapes Of The Thumb

There are many very distinct variations in the shape of the thumb.

With the elementary hand, we usually find an almost shapeless thumb, heavy, short and coarse. With this thumb, we will usually discover little intelligence or control, and a coarse brutality.

The club-shaped thumb (see plate 21) has a heavy, ball-shaped will-phalanx, thick and round, with a short nail of rough texture. This shape assures tremendous obstinacy and, in a hand which is otherwise of low grade, a violent temper. Because of its association with violence, the club-shaped thumb has been called the "murderer's thumb," though of course it does not actually indicate a murderer. 

In fact, the violent characteristics linked to it may be completely submerged and never given expression.

In nervous persons, I have often found the thumb quite flat, as though spread out by a weight and usually soft and flabby in texture.

A thumb which has a broad structure and firm, healthy texture tells of determination backed by aggressiveness and physical strength. 

I have frequently found thumbs of this type in successful men.

When the will-phalanx is broad on the nail side and spread out into a paddle-like shape (see plate 22), you have strong determination, which, if  over-developed, becomes tyranny and obstinacy. 

The paddle shape  gives strength even if the phalanx is flat from front to back, though in that case the strength may be only mental control with low physical endurance.

A very long and slender thumb indicates sensitiveness, accomanied by great power of will, excellent reasoning ability, and intuitional understanding.

The ideal for a normal hand is, of course, a thumb of normal length and thickness, well-shaped and evenly proportioned.

It shows strength of will as well as the capacity for logical reasoning.

With such a thumb, you will find diplomacy, firmness, intelligence, and discrimination.


## Flexibility

The flexibility of the thumb, almost as much as its shape tells the character of its possessor.

A stiff joint (see plate 23) which holds the thumb in a straight line and close to the hand indicates practicality, caution, reliability and materialism. 

When the texture and shape of a stiff thumb are coarse, these qualities degenerate to crassness.

A flexible thumb (see plate 24), bending outward at the joint, shows an extravagant, open-hearted, adventurous nature. Emotional
exuberance, brilliant social qualities, adaptability and wit go with this supple thumb. 

To make for happiness, these fortunate qualities should, however, be checked by practicality and self-reliance.

In studying a hand, always balance the indications of the thumb  with the traits shown by the fingers and palm.

A strong thumb on a sensitive, weak hand may supply the force needed to bring complete realization of the self. 

A weak thumb may negate all the gifts of a brilliant personality.
