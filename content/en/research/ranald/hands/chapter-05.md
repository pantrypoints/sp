WHEN you look at the inner face of the palm, you do not see a flat surface, like a table top, but instead you find many small and large muscular swellings.

If you study their formation carefully you will notice that:
- there is such a pad under each finger
- there are others toward the wrist and in the center of the palm.

These swellings are known as the mounts of the hand.


## Mount Jupiter


under the fingers take
their
names from the individual
The mounts
fingers
and
in
general share the qualities ascribed to their corresponding finger:
thus, mount Jupiter lies under the index finger mount Saturn under
;
the second finger; mount Apollo under the ring finger; and Mount
Mercury under the finger of Mercury. The two mounts of Mars,
known
mounts
Mars positive and Mars negative, are located under the
of Jupiter and Mercury, respectively. The large mounts at
as
the base of the
palm are Luna on the outer edge and Venus forming
mounts of
the base of the thumb. Plate 25 shows the positions of the
the hand.

The mount of Jupiter is underneath the first finger. It indicates pride and ambition, the desire to dominate others. 

When mount Jupiter is well developed and the finger of Jupiter is dominant, you will find pride swollen into vanity and bluster.

The Jupiterian is one where the finger of Jupiter is dominant and the mount is highly developed.

He is frequently religious and derives great comfort from the pageantry and show of church worship. You will often find high dignitaries of the church among the children of Jupiter.

The qualities of leadership which go with a strong finger of Jupiter can also find their expression in other fields. 

For example, given long spatulate- tipped fingers and a domineering thumb, your Jupiterian be a military conqueror, his qualities being orderliness and rigidity, ambition, energy and daring, and a desire to dominate others.


## MOUNT SATURN

The mount of Saturn under the second finger signifies seriousness, thought, and prudence, especially in money matters. 

I have rarely seen very strong development of this mount together with a strong finger of Saturn.

fact, the mount is sometimes depressed when the Saturn finger shows strength.

However, even when the mount is not very prominent, a person may still be classified as a Saturnian if the second finger is dominant.

When the Saturn finger has slender, waisted phalanxes, the thoughtful mind accentuated. 

Credulity will be reduced to a minimum, and you have a critical, skeptical, analytical brain.

The Saturnian distrusts others until he has satisfied himself of their motives.

Consequently, he is usually an individualist, undertaking business enterprises by himself and disliking unnecessary social contacts.

This is fortunate for the others as much as for himself, because the Saturnian is dour and pessimistic, a wet blanket on the exuberance on those who have a different temperament.

The thrift which characterizes the Saturnian is exaggerated into meanness and miserliness if the lowest (material) phalanx is strongest.

If the heart line is unstable and the tip of a dominant Saturn finger unusually sensitive, you have a morbid cast to the thoughts with a tendency toward self-criticism and despondency.

## Mount Apollo

The mount of Apollo, like the mount of Jupiter, shows ambition, but it is a more highly specialized ambition for renown and admiration. 

This finger and mount have almost the exact opposite connotation from that of Saturn.

The Apollonian looks for success and self-realization through other people.

He is gay, sociable, worldly, emotional.


He is a lover of beauty, though not a creator of it. 


When the third finger is excessively long and the mount well developed, impulsiveness is exaggerated to the point of rashness, and the owner of such a hand is likely to be fascinated by gambling.


A long space between the base of the thumb and of the first finger emphasizes this tendency still further.

The Apollonian may be an excellent business man. For confirmation, look to a long middle phalanx on the Apollo finger, and a good line of head.

Likely as not, this type of Apollonian will display his love of drama, beauty and color in some way through his business activities.

The bad qualities of the mount and finger of Apollo predominate if the finger is crooked, or if the mount or base phalanx is excessively developed in comparison with the other two. 

Then the subject will be vain, boastful, reckless, and perhaps sexually vicious or dissolute.

But, on the whole, the mount of Apollo introduces optimism and gaiety into life, acting an an antidote to the heaviness of Saturn.

## Mount Mercury

Quickness is the quality most associated with the mount of Mercury under the fourth finger.

The Mercurian has a keen, almost intuitive mind, especially if the Apollo mount is at the same time fairly well developed.

He is exceedingly shrewd, and, if he has a bad hand, or if the finger itself is twisted or shows only worldly tendencies, his active brain is likely to hatch cunning schemes for the exploitation of his fellows.

The Mercurian is never a brutally vicious type, but rather a gyp artist or con man, shyster lawyer or promoter of fraudulent enterprises.

If all the fingers are crooked with a highly developed mount of Mercury, you have definite indication of a criminal type of 
mind.

Unlike the Saturnian, whose analytical mind finds difficulty in expressing itself, the Mercurian is gifted with an easy flow of words. 

He makes an excellent trial lawyer, a brilliant advocate, though more likely moved to speak by ambition than by devotion to the cause he is championing.

## Mount Luna

The Mount of Luna is at the base of the palm on its outer side.

It governs the imagination and intuition. Good development of this mount plus directed energy are necessary to transform the Apollonian, with his appreciation of art, into the creator. 

With a well developed finger and mount of Mercury, a prominent mount of Luna gives promise of creative ability to writers of fiction and romance.

The kind of fingertips and thumb combined with a well-developed mount of Luna are extremely important, for, with a weak, over-
sensitive hand, the imagination is wasted in dreaming.

When practicality is lacking, the mount of Luna may lead to activity, but of a fantastic nature, such as the designing of machines of perpetual motion.

To judge whether mount Luna is well developed, examine its bulge both along the side of the hand and upward from the surface of the palm. 

A well-rounded curve on the outer edge of the hand indicates good development. If the mount is both outcurving and high, the mount of Luna is very strong. (See plate 26.)

Vertical lines on this mount add to its strength. Crosswise markings weaken it, or indicate defects such as a morbid trend to the imagination.

Mount Luna should always be studied in connection with the line of head, for any inclination of the headline downwards, towards 
the mount of Luna, shows the influence of imagination in the thinking.

In addition, signs of mental disturbances found on the line of head are often repeated or explained by the mount of Luna. 

Where the development of Luna is excessive, you can expect mental or emotional unbalance, or both.


## Mount Venus

The mount of Venus is at the base of the thumb bounded by the life line.

This mount indicates both the vitality and general health of the subject and the nature of his affections.

When you have a well-developed, prominent swelling on the mount of Venus, you may be sure of a generous, warm-hearted, lively personality with strong amorous instincts.

Attractiveness for the opposite sex almost always goes with a well-developed mount of Venus, and health, optimistic spirits, gaiety and love of music are other attributes which belong to this type.

If the mount of Venus is overdeveloped, particularly at at its base close to the wrist, the animal instincts and passions predominate.

Their expression, however, is a natural one, and neither vicious nor perverted.


## The Three Mounts Of Mars

The mount of Mars is the most difficult of all to study, for it is made up of 3 sections:

1. Mars positive under Jupiter, above the mount of Venus
2. Mars negative under Mercury, above the mount of Luna
3. The plain of Mars in the center of the palm (see plate 25).

Each of these divisions has its own significance, though the characteristics of Mars as a whole are courage and aggressiveness.

Mars positive, near the thumb, is the most pugnacious, spirited section. Its bravery is the courage of the soldier and adventurer, which is largely physical.

Mars negative, horizontally on a level with the positive Mars, but on the opposite side of the palm, is the courage of resistance. 

It may find expression physically, or through great moral stamina.

A person with both these mounts well developed will push himself over all obstacles and never give in to defeat.

A prominent development of the plain of Mars emphasizes the both Mars negative and positive. In addition, especially when the plain is crossed by many horizontal lines, it indicates violent temper. 

The combination becomes dangerous when there is very high development of all 3 portions, as temper is then immediately translated into physical violence.

A strong thumb and line of head are needed to curb the impetuosity of this combination.

The triple mount of Mars has greater importance than merely to indicate courage or the lack of it.

For when Mars in all its aspects is deficient, the subject is extremely weak, defeated in life even before he begins.

If the morbid tendencies of Saturn are highly developed, and you find signs of an introspective imagination together with a failure in Mars, then you have a typical would-be suicide.

Apart from their significance in themselves, the mounts of the hand are important in relation to the lines of the palm. 

Deflections of the line of head or heart, for example, toward any one of the mounts, show the influence of that mount over the faculty with which the line is associated.

This is why it is extremely important that a serious student of the hands be acquainted with the attributes allied to the mounts.
