The line of life (see plate 27, number 1) bounds the mounts of Venus and Mars positive, fencing in the entire region about the base of the thumb. 

Its beginning is under the finger of Jupiter, its end in most cases under the mount of Venus, at the wrist. This line, according to the older theories of palmistry, was supposed to indicate longevity and the times when disease or danger threatened.

Thus I have found to be an extremely literal interpretation of the lifeline’s actual function, which is to give an index of your health.



I have seen hands in which an actual break or even the ending of the line of life has not been followed by any dire results. Strong lines of the hands and hearts and a good thumb even overcome the indicators of weakness in the line of life, and to conclude that a person's life is actually in danger at any given period, the hand analysts must look for confirmation in other parts of the hand. 

The clearest sign of departure from this life is the stopping of all the principal lines at the same date.

If the line of life is made up of little pieces, broken, or linked together, vitality is weak, often because of poor digestive functioning.

When the line of life commences high under the first finger the subject will be ambitious and well controlled, directing his energies to the attainment of his ambitions. A lower origin shows the opposite. The usual point at which the line of life begins is about halfway between the thumb and the base of the index finger.

The line of life may also vary in its termination. If it swerves toward the mount of Luna on the opposite side of the hand (see plate 30), it indicates a restless nature which may lead to wide travel and residence and death in a foreign land. 

The sudden termination of the line of life, marked by a star or cross, shows the threat of sudden death or accident, especially if other signs in the hand bear out this warning.


If the line of life arcs far out into the hand (see plate 31), enlarging the space occupied by the mount of Venus, you will find a warm, generous and sympathetic nature.

If Venus is constricted into a narrow space (see plate 32), you are likely to find a cold and selfish one.
