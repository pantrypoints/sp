The line of Apollo (see plate 27, number 5) is not present in every hand nor even in the majority.

Without it, the hand is poor, promising hardship and struggle without assurance of success. 

The line of Apollo, which runs from the wrist towards the base of the the line of luck or fortune. 

In many hands, this line is missing until quite late in life.

After it puts in its appearance, the entire life becomes changed, assuming a more optimistic, easy aspect.

Both the length of this line and its quality determine to what extent its force is operative.

Defects in its structure greatly reduce its influence. Islands, for example, practically nullify its effect for the period represented by the malformation. 

Dots, to the extent that any sign can be so definitely associated with a single meaning, I have found connected with loss of reputation and notoriety. Breaks in the line show difficulties or interruptions to good fortune; cross bars, contrary influences. 

As to the line itself, the longer it is, the longer will good fortune last.

Sometimes the line of Apollo acts as a sister line for that of Saturn, becoming stronger when the latter dims and itself fading when the line of Saturn gains strength.

The line of Apollo always runs in the direction of the Apollo though it may stop short of that goal. 

A firm line, clean and deep at its termination means success crowning the termination of your life. 

If the line loses strength or ends before reaching the mount of Apollo, the end of life will contain some disappointments, not necessarily reverses in business, loss of fortune or a bad outcome to your career, but possibly disappointments connected with your family, children, or others on whom your own happiness depends. 

Fading of the Apollo line towards its end may also show a change of disposition to a more sombre hue, such as is characteristic of certain illnesses which afflict old age.

If there is a sign at the end of the line, this must be considered in conjunction with the line.

A dot, as in other portions of the line, shows loss of reputation. 

A deep bar cutting off the line indicates an insurmountable obstacle near the close of the life. 

Should the life line exhibit weakness at around 50 years old, then such a bar is likely to be an illness or delicate health. 

A cross marking the termination of the line of Apollo is often a sign of foolhardiness causing repute, and the line of head should be looked at carefully to see  whether  it bears out this indication of poor judgment.

An island at the end of the Apollo line negatives much of the line's efficacy, telling that life is likely to close under some sort of shadow, usually associated with loss of wealth and reputation.

These are the unfortunate signs on the line of Apollo. The more desirable ones are a square, a trident (see plate 48) and, above all, a star. 

With a star at the termination of the Apollo line, you have strong assurance of brilliant success.

I have found this sign in the financiers, writers, artists and statesmen, and in every case, these persons have felt themselves blessed by some kind of lucky fortune, something for which they themselves could not account, but which seemed to direct all their undertakings to fortunate conclusions.

The square is, as always, a healing mark, operating against all the defects of the line throughout its entire length.

A forked ending is not altogether favorable. 

It shows a diversity of talents which may, if concentration and determination are lacking, lead to dissipation of your endowments. 

But when the fork assumes the shape of a well-marked trident, this is almost as fortunate as a star because it indicates wealth and celebrity achieved through mental efforts. 

The star is less specific in its promise, but is frequently associated in some way with the arts or the theater.

The Apollo line may, near its end, branch off to mount Saturn or Mercury. 

In such case, add the wisdom of Saturn or the shrewdness and business judgment of Mercury to the brilliance of Apollo. 

Other branches from the line can be regarded much in the same light.

When they take a rising direction, they are favorable, and their specific application can be deduced from the direction in which they point. 

Falling branches and hairlines show the need for greater concentration and effort to enjoy the full benefit of a good Apollo line. 

Now as to the nature of the line itself. Of course, a sharp, deep, clearcut line with good color is best.

A broad, shallow line gives a  rather surface appreciation of the arts and some success in connection with them, but it also carries the implication of great show and a false front.

A chained line, especially when it is shallow, gives the hollow semblance of success and reputation -- one who talks much
about his attainments but fools no one but himself.

A wavy line tells of vacillation, a career which suffers because of erratic waverings and unreliability.

The origin of the Apollo line modifies its significance to a slight degree.

When it rises from the mount of Luna (see plate 49), it will show strong imagination joined to good powers of expression. Such a
line is a great boon for writers, lecturers and speakers of all kinds.

When the line of Apollo starts from the wrist and runs all the way to the Apollo mount, it has its greatest length and will throw its fortunate influence over the entire life.

If the line starts low, but runs only for a short distance, unusual talents and opportunities of early life will be frittered away.

The line of Apollo beginning from the line of life (see plate 50), usually associated with success in artistic work, the higher its point of origin on the lifeline, the later will the career bear fruit. 

Starting from the line of destiny (see plate 51), the Apollo line places a crown of good fortune on a person's own efforts. 

A beginning from the line head adds luck to brain work, and a start from the line of heart indicates very happy sex relations such as a marriage which will contribute to happiness, wealth and reputation. Usually, this last indication applies to the latter part of life.

To some extent, the influences of the lines of Apollo and Saturn are overlapping.

They can, however, be distinguished in this way.

Saturn line refers more to the active career. The Apollo line governs the chance and luck attending that career. 

Apollo applies particularly to the outward semblances of success wealth and reputation.

have not been able to explain to my entire satisfaction.  -->

Many other signs in the hand have previously been assigned a superstitious rather than a psychological or physiological significance.

able to consider in a more scientific light.  -->

At first, I ignored the influence of the Apollo line entirely.

But actual study of many thousands of hands taught me that persons who lacked this line were practically always beset by difficulties, favorable the other indications in their hands.

On the other hand, those who had this sign of fortune seemed favored by luck or chance.
