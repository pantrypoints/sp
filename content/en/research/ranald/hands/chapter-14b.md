### THE LINE OF VITALITY

This is also called the line of Mars (number 10). It is a sister line to the line of life, running parallel to it inside its enclosure.

This line greatly strengthens a weak line of life and adds tremendous energy to a good one*.

{{< n n="In Benham's system this indicates help from family or bloodline. " >}}

Its aid is limited to the period during which it extends, and only when the line of vitality continues for the whole length of the line of life is its effect felt from birth to death. 

On the whole, the line of Mars is an excellent indication, but there is always the danger that the bounding energy and vitality it gives will lead to excesses of various kinds.


### THE RING OF SOLOMON

The ring of Solomon (see plate 27, number 15) is a very unusual formation, made by an extension of the line of heart which, instead of rising on the mount of Jupiter, begins as a semicircle curling like a ring around the base of the Jupiter finger.

This sign I have found associated with a very fastidious, sensitive nature, often possessing psychic or clairvoyant powers. 

Its presence, though at best rare, is more frequent in the hands of women than of men.


### THE RING OF SATURN

This is a line circling the base of the middle finger or formed of 2 lines starting on either side of that finger and crossing below it. 

It is an unfavorable sign, indicating lack of constancy and should be read as a warning to overcome vacillation and changeableness. To negate its effectm, a strong-willed thumb and good line of head should be present.


### THE BRACELETS

The bracelets (see plate 27, number 11) are the rings on the wrist, denning the lower edge of the palm. They may be absent altogether or there may be one or two or, at the most, three. These used to be considered indications of longevity, a term of thirty years being arbitrarily assigned to each bracelet. 

In my studies of hands, I have found the bracelets to mean very little, except that the upcurving of the topmost one into the palm itself is strong indication of sterility.


### THE LINES OF TRAVEL

The lines of travel (see plate 27, number 12) are actually not prophetic marks of future wanderings over the face of the earth, but rather the indications of a restlessness which may very well find its expression in voyagings.

These lines are found cutting into the palm from far on the outer edge of the Lunar mount. They run in a
diagonally upward direction. 

When the travel lines merge with the be your career or a part of it. 

As to fixing the date of the voyages, the diagram fixing time in the hand applies to these lines as to the others. 

Restlessness, the desire to be line of destiny, travel is likely to on the move, to see new places, people and things is stronger at some periods of life than others. 

Some persons are hit by wanderlust in their youth, others not until after they have satisfied other ambitions. This is the extent to which these lines fix the dates of voyages.
