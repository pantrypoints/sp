## THE STAR

The star (see plate 55) is, with only two exceptions, one of the most fortunate signs to have.

One negative implication is connected with a star on the line of head, particularly at its end (see plate 56, 1 ).

This may be a sign of a kind of genius which crosses the border into insanity.

A star on mount Saturn, under the middle finger, is the second unfortunate placement. 

This is manifestation of a dreaded kind of distinction, of notoriety and infamy more as the result of circumstances than through
any wrong-doing of the person himself. 


The more favorable placements of the star give great distinction.

A star on the mount of Apollo (see plate 56, 3) is a sign of the greatest good luck, promising wealth, renown and happiness. 



This position usually associated with a public career. A star on the positive mount of Mars above the Venus mount (see plate 56, 8), is more particularized, being usually associated with distinction in military affairs. 

On mount Jupiter (see plate 56, 12), a star signifies capacity for leadership and its realization. 

On mount Mercury (see plate 56,4) the star promises success in the fields associated with that mount, science or commerce, according to the other indications of the hand.

A star on the negative mount of Mars on the outer edge of the palm between the Lunar mount and that of Mercury (see plate 56, 7) promises recompense and honor for great moral courage. 

A star on  mount Luna (see plate 56, 10) gives celebrity achieved through application of a vivid imagination. 

A star on mount Venus (see plate 56, 9) tells of unusual magnetism for the opposite sex.


CIRCLES
STARS
ISLANDS TBIPOD5
CROSSES SQUARES
GRILLES

A star on the plain of Mars (see plate 56, 6) marks you for success in invention. 

Between the origin of the line of life and the line of destiny (see plate 56, 5), a star indicates prominence in theology.

On the tips of the other fingers (see plate 56, 11), a star emphasizes the facility with language which is associated with that finger and tells of spellbinding eloquence.

On the tips of the other fingers (see plate 56, 13), stars are marks of well developed sensory nerves, giving unusually delicate
perception to the fingertips. 


## The Island

Unlike the star, an island (see plate 55) is never a fortunate sign.

When found in the body of a line, it reduces the positive implications of that line. 

When found in other positions, it usually weakens the promise of a mount or finger.

On mount Jupiter (see plate 57, 1), an island shows some misfortune, possibly enmities, resulting from an overly ambitious, domineering nature. 


{{< i s="/graphics/bio/islands.jpg" a="Stars" >}}

On mount Saturn (see plate 57, 2), an island produces a morbid, dark-tinged trend of thought.

An island on or under mount Apollo (see plate 56, 3) shows loss of reputation through gossip or malicious interference by others. 

On mount Mercury (see plate 57, 4), an island means losses in business.

On the heart line (see plate 57, 11), it means unfortunate loves.

On the head (see plate 57, 5), it means either frequent headaches or some interference with the reason.

At the end of the line of life (see plate 57, 9), some mystery, perhaps associated with the manner or circumstances of death; 

On mount Venus (see plate 57, 8), it means unhappy infatuations.

On Mars positive (see plate 57, 7), it means fear of violence, though this may be temporary. 

An island on mount Luna (see plate 57, 6), unless it is accompanied by a very poor line of head or a weak thumb, can usually be counteracted. 

Its indication is of a disordered, fantastic imagination, and discipline will overcome it.


## The Cross

The cross (see plate 55) is fortunate or unfortunate according to its position.

Under the index finger (see plate 58, 1), it brings fulfillment to ambition. 

On mount Saturn (see plate 58, 2), it signifies a morbid disposition, though not so deep nor consistent a melancholia as that connoted by an island in this position. 

Under the Apollo finger (see plate 58, 3), a cross gives keen observation, invaluable to the student of human nature or the reporter. 

On mount Mercury (see plate 58, 4), a cross intensifies the keen business sense which goes with that finger.


A cross on mount Mars, negative under Mercury (see plate 58, 6), ameliorates stubbornness.

On mount Luna (see plate 58, 7), a cross shows a vivid imagination put to the use of self-deception, and on the plain of Mars, between the lines of head and heart (see plate 58, 5), a cross signifies a person fascinated by mysticism.
