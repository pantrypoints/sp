## The Triangle

The triangle is usually found on one of the mounts. It points  the special talents associated with that mount or with the finger of the same name.

A triangle on mount Jupiter (see plate 59, 1) shows the ability to rule great masses of people.

A triangle on mount Saturn (see plate 59, 2) counteracts the sombreness of that thoughtful finger and indicates melancholy successfully overcome. 

A triangle under the Apollo finger (see plate 59, 3) gives administrative ability

Under the Mercury finger (see plate 59, 4), it shows executive powers in business. 

On Mars negative (see plate 59, 7), manifests great spiritual resources. 

At the end of the line of head (see plate 59, 8), it gives the powers of sound reasoning to counteract too vivid an imagination. 

On mount Luna (see plate 59, 9), a triangle shows presence of mind in emergency; on Venus (see plate 59, 11), calmness and stability in love.

On Mars positive (see plate 59, 5) social interests and abilities.


## THE CIRCLE

The circle has but few connotations.

I have often found it situated under the third finger or between the second and third fingers in the hands of singers or those who are gifted musically in other ways.

At  the base of mount Luna, a circle shows vivid dramatic imagination.



## THE TRIPOD

A fork with 2 short even branches, like the base of a photographer's tripod seen sectionally (see plate 55) shows dramatic talent. 

I have found a formation of this shape on the lines of head, on the destiny line, on the Apollo line, or even on the line of heart of some of those who have made their mark behind the world's footlights or under the Kleigs. 

This is called a tripod.


## The Square

A square (see plate 55) is always a sign of healing. 

When it binds a broken line together, it shows the overcoming of whatever originally caused the break. The square must be considered in relation to the position in which it appears.

On a mount, it means protection from the negative connotations of that mount. On a line, it means preservation from ill health, from excesses, from poor choice in the selection of your career, protection from bad judgment in a love affair, or in business.


## The Grille

A grille is made up of many lines crossing in opposite directions, resulting in a sort of screen effect (see plate 55), may
be found in usually appears on a mount.  

The grille signifies difficulties and weaknesses in connection with the qualities associated with the particular mount on which it appears. 

On the mount of Mercury, a grille connotes indiscretion.

on Apollo, vanity and danger of notoriety from too much seeking of the limelight.

on Saturn, melancholia; on Jupiter, stiffnecked pride and a domineering nature.


## Significance Of The Signs

The force of any of the incidental marks on a hand must, be read in conjunction with the general indications of the hand -- its shape, consistency, flexibility, especially in connection with the particular line or mount on which the mark occurs.

<!-- course, the force of like everything else, -->

An island, for example, weak throughout  its entire length, or much broken up after the appearance of the island.

My experience with hands leads me to differ with those authorities who deny all significance to such markings as the square, island, circle or grille. 

But I do agree with them that too arbitrary and specific a meaning can be read into them. The import of these signs must be arrived at through a balancing of all the factors appearing in the hand, and the interpretation placed on them must never be given finality.

The hand must always be regarded in a state of flux, just as is the personality as a whole. If you make a point of studying hands over a period of years, you will be surprised at the changes to be found in a person's hand as he grows and changes.
