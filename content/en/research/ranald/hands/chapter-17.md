ABNORMALITIES in shape, strength, texture, brittleness, and color of the nails are accepted even by the most conservative of medicos as indicative of the body's condition. Already, there are nail symptoms which are hardly open to question. 

Interpretation of others is still controversial.

The nails show a peron's physical condition.

On more than one occasion, I have been able to point to definite dangers menacing the health of an individual, and the treatment of the condition I discovered has in some cases prevented its becoming much more serious.

Where a case has already been diagnosed, a skeptic might say that my guess was the result of telepathic communication, but where mine was the original diagnosis, the only explanation which satisfies reason is that I use an accurate method.


The nail's shape in itself shows predispositions towards certain ailments and is a fairly good index to a person's general physical condition.

Long, oval-shaped nails (see plate 60) usually belong to those whose physical constitution is weak.

With nails of this oval shape are associated deficiencies of the blood like anemia, and diseases of the respiratory system. 

A bluish color on nails of this type is added evidence of anemia.

The liability to pulmonary diseases is perhaps as much due to lowered resistance, a result of malnourishment and resultant anemia, as to any direct association between nails and the lungs.
 
A short, neat, oval nail, without moons (see plate 61) is classed as the cardiac type. Its color is usually bluish. 

This may signify an organic defect of the heart.

The same shape on a nail with moons well-developed is often the accompaniment of functional disorders of the circulatory system, palpitations or high blood pressure. 

A very high arch in the nail supports the diagnonis of palpitations. 

Short nails, very flat and broad at the tip but tapering into a point at the base and thus giving a triangular effect (see plate 62) are most often found on persons of highly nervous temperament.

A short, narrow nail, pale, very thin and much curved, is often found to accompany either calcium deficiency or incomplete calcium assimilation. 

Since the utilization of calcium in our bodies is closely connected with the endocrine glands, such nails are often a warning
to look into the glandular functioning.
