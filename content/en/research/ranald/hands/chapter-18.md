So far as the hand goes, any irregularity in
size
immediately
arouses the doctor's suspicion. If the hands are noticeably large, the
palms deepened, all the palmar eminences enlarged and the fingers
stubby with the first phalanx having a slightly puffy appearance,

ailments which result from abnormalities in the workings of
this gland are often obscure and badly understood. In such case, the
additional evidence which the hands offer ought certainly not to be

Diseases of the thyroid gland are also evidenced in the hand. In
hyperthyroidism or myxedema, the metabolism of the entire body is
thrown out of gear. This produces changes
in the
appearance of
the skin, including the subcutaneous tissue lying directly under it.
Since the thyroid gland also regulates some of the activities of the
internal organs, such as the liver, and is responsible for the rate of
absorption of fat in the body, faulty secretion by the thyroid gland
causes accumulation of fatty tissue in certain parts of the body,
usually in the face, the torso and the hands.
As the condition is aggravated, the face becomes over-developed
and the hands take on a fat, pudgy look. Action of the entire system
becomes sluggish and dull. The extreme condition of this disease
produces a mental and physical torpor approaching idiocy. By
careful administration of thyroid extract to patients suffering from
the disease, the fat

When
the body's calcium-phosphorous balance is disturbed, an-
other noticeable change occurs in the hands. The cuticle becomes
excessive in formation, and the skin around the nails, instead of
being soft and pliable, becomes hard, dry and cracked. Defective
"parathyroid" conditions may speed up this abnormal reaction. Often
patients whose hands bear thick, dry cuticles like this are subject
to rheumatic diseases
and
to arteriosclerosis,
as hardening of the arteries.

Diagnosis of chronic rheumatism is aided by the study of the
hand's appearance, for the appendicular symptoms of rheumatism
are quite definite. The knuckles are knobbed and swollen, sometimes
painful, but they can easily be recognized
by the knoblike protu-
berance of the joints. This is not to be confused with the knotty bone
formation of a healthy large-jointed hand. Where there is a morbid
condition of the joint, you will usually see the skin inflamed and
stretched over the projecting articulations. There are also deformi-
ties and unnatural shapes of the hand associated with many other
diseases,
