A warm, pliant skin, especially when it is excessively moist, points to 
the possibility of sexual abnormalities. This may take the form of
overestimated sex impulses, even though the impulses are not given
direct expression. In fact, inhibition sometimes intensifies the condition
and leads
to
corollary diseases.

Another possibility
to be explored in connection with this type of skin is overactivity of the
thyroid gland and the nervous excitation which is its accompaniment.
Very fine skin of normal temperature and moisture, covering flesh
of firm, elastic consistency, shows a personality very close to normal
except for a slight tendency towards greater than average sensitivity
to nervous excitation.

In diagnosing functional ailments, the physician has found that
psychological aspects must play a larger and larger part in his con-
siderations. Suggestion, auto-suggestion and hysteria are often ac-
companied by physiological symptoms which can scarcely be dis-
tinguished from actual disorders. In some cases, one leads to the

of the more advanced psychoses.

For every maladjustment, there are previous indications, identifying the type of person and the type of mental unbalance to be expected of him.

The wide swings from one extreme to another characteristic of manic-depressive insanity find their expression in
the hand, and the duality of the schizophrenic is also shown there.

Where the headline itself is of poor quality, feathered, broken or chained, too vivid an imagination and tendencies to melancholia are almost predestined to result in unbalance. 

Therefore, an inferior headline with a branch swinging sharply down and penetrating deeply on to the mount of Luna can be taken as corroborating indication of this type of insanity. 

In a hand with a very poor headline, if the mount of Venus is not and the mount of Saturn is dominant, morbid hallu-
well developed cinations may occur in early life. 

In such cases, proper therapeutic measures are able to stabilize the mind, but opposition or attempts at suppression aggravate the condition.

The various degrees of subnormal mentality are usually coupled with hands which have no marked abnormalities but rather a generally subnormal index.

Intestinal infections show up as irregular breaks in the ridges and
pieces gouged out of their edge, giving the ridges a crenellated out-
line. Non-malignant ulcers are associated with lack of definition in
the ridging of the skin caused by irregular interruptions and a sort of
featheriness in the ridges' outlines.

Perhaps it is in early identification of the dread disease, cancer,
that study of the hand will have its greatest value to medicine.

All authorities are agreed that early diagnosis and treatment in the
first stages are essential. Yet the first symptoms are often so vague
that they are passed over as of no consequence

Authorities find that the hand quite definitely indicates the
predisposition to cancer, and early stages of the disease can readily
be detected.

Malignant growth can be identified by the typical
malformation of the palmar ridges. Seen under the microscope, these show regular breaks made by clean transverse cuts
at fairly even
intervals, giving the ridges the general appearance of rows of tiny
soldiers.

This cancerous formation
is
almost always placed just under
the end of the line of head.


In the same way, the hand will show characteristic deviations from normal surface markings for diabetes, disorders of the genital system, kidneys, liver or nerve and circulatory machinery. 

It is hardly within the scope of this book to enlarge on these symptoms, nor is it the place of a layman to theorize too extensively about the nature and cause of disease.
