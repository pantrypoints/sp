Only recently has the western world has adopted fingerprinting to aid:

- in keeping track of records embracing large numbers of persons. 

The master criminal identification file which the Federal government has built up in Washington contains what is probably the largest collection of fingerprints in the world, each classified according to type, and no two
exactly alike.

This is the basis of the fingerprint identification system that there are no two sets of fingerprints in the world which are exactly
alike and further that each record is a permanent one. 

Though the hands change in the shape even of their bony structure, though the strong, muscular hand of a youth will become flabby and corded with

Other objections can also be raised, not to the use of fingerprints

The instances of such confusion are rare, but think of the anguish
of even one pair of parents who will never be certain if the child

various impostures have resulted. Handprinting at birth would com-

mother's hand.

Many institutions have come to
realize the value of finger
and
handprints. 

Maternity hospitals, finding that the tiny ridges on a baby's fingertips are too minute to make clear impressions, take prints of the foot. 

Footprints, however, do change more or less during the course of a lifetime. Because of this, Dr.  Gilbert Palmer Pond has evolved a means which provides identification for life, using prints of an infant's palm. The ridging on the eminences of the palm usually coarser than that on baby's fingertips, and such hospital impressions supply a means of identification which can be used for

could be used to restore them again to their families?
I recall one instance, which recently came to my attention, of
an elderly woman who was led out of a large New York department
store at closing time. She appeared to be a person of culture and
refinement, accustomed to care and thoughtfulness from others. A
victim of amnesia, she had forgotten what brought her to the store,
who she was or where she came from. 

Institutions gave her their
comfortless hospitality while her frantic family in another city
appealed to the police, to travelers' aid societies, to welfare agencies, 
and even to hired private detectives. They spent terrifying hours
examining unidentified bodies in morgues and studying photographs
of other old women, picked up without name or associations. Only

brought this grandmother and
her family together again. Think of the suffering which might have
been avoided had her family been able to send her fingerprints to
and hospitals all over the country.

identity to which fingerprints would yield an answer, consider the

In 1935, according to police records, almost 16,000 persons were reported "missing" in France's capital.

And
these amazing figures apply to a city where everyone
is re-
quired to register and carry papers of identification. In this country,
the numbers are even more astounding. The New York City Missing
Persons Bureau is now burdened with over thirty thousand identifi-
cation cases each year. Eight thousand dead are buried every year in
York's potter's field, some because their families are unable to

accidents and were never identified. Meantime, their families' grief
is continually renewed by uncertainty. The sparsely populated county
of Los Angeles in California reported for one year over one hundred
amnesia victims unidentified and consequently committed to insti-
tutions.

These figures apply to representative cities in normal times. In
flood and earthquake, the number of unidentified victims is

appalling. Children, separated from their families, are never reunited
with them. The dead and the injured are unclaimed. 

Bereaved families

The government recognized the aid which fingerprinting would
give when it ordered impressions made of all enlisted men in the
world war. For this reason, the number of missing and unknown
soldier dead was much cut down.
