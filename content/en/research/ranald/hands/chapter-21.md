## Child Training

IN DISCUSSING guidance, I
wish
the application of hand analysis to vocational
to take issue with the neat tabular classifications

first
by which palmists used to assign a person to life as baker,
broker, soldier or prima donna by virtue of a single indication of the
hand. Nothing like that is possible. In prescribing a life's work, we
must be as open minded and exact as a physician in prescribing a

cure for diabetes. Tables sweepingly recommending certain vocations
to hands of a given conformation are comparable to the medicine

astrous as in medicine.

psychology which deals with the workings of man's more or less
intangible processes, and physiology which deals with the tangible,
scientific basis use the
physical evidences of his functioning. Study of hands, with its bear-
ing on both the mental or psychic aspect of man and on the medical
or physical, should certainly be a part of all efforts to fit round
pegs into round roles, square pegs into square holes. Study of man
must precede proper direction of him, whether by himself or by
others, and the hands, I have found, are a sure aid in man's study
of man.
In my opinion the time to begin vocational training is in child-
hood. During the formative years, talents may be either developed
naturally or twisted into unhealthy channels
