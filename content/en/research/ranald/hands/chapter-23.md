In the following pages you will find the hands and analyses of ten world famous personages outstanding in different lines of endeavor. 

Observe the various signs and lines in their hands that indicate their fame and success.

strong traits. His qualities of leadership are, however, displayed by
a heavy mount of Jupiter.
The very free-set, heavy thumb immediately strikes your eye
when you study the president's handprint. This shows great gen-
and will. His broad, open-minded approach to
problems is also bo.ne out by the line of life which curves far out
into his hand. At the same time, the line of life is both deep and

long and is bolstered by the sister line of vitality, indicating remark-
able physical endurance.
The line of head, which is unusually long, runs straight across the
hand, a sign of excellent, balanced
intellect,
the ability to think
and independently. He has an intuitive grasp of
things and an immediate understanding of people. He is by no means
stubborn. On the contrary, he is very ready to seek and take advance,
but he must be convinced that counsel is sound before he will fol-

The president's line of destiny is a most fortunate one for anyone
in a public career. Starting on the mount of Luna, it shows creative

force and the helpful influence of others
furthering his advancement. The termination of his line of destiny,
which joins the line of heart, points to an exceedingly happy mar-
riage, also influential in bringing success. But the line of Apollo,
beginning as it does on the line of destiny, says that Mr. Roosevelt
himself supplemented the aid from others by his own efforts and is
himself greatly responsible for the high place he holds.
Loyalty and idealism characterize Franklin Roosevelt's affections.
Notice also the three lines, in trident formation, found at the begin-
ning of Roosevelt's line of heart under the finger of Jupiter. These
are the lines of courage, a courage which grows as the obstacles in
his way become more difficult.
From the study of his hand I become more and more convinced
of the greatness of this man and of the place he will occupy in his-
tory. That was my conviction as far back as 1930, when I first
studied his hand
that he can truly be counted as one of America's
great men and that his name will go down with those of Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln as one who saw his country through a most
difficult period and successfully championed its democratic principles.

an adult's well-controlled emotions. I would say that the Duke
of Windsor's hand is that of a man who never grew up. He belongs
to the "lost generation," whose formative years were lived in the hell
of Europe's great war. That generation faced death daily and for re-
laxation turned to irresponsible extravagances and pleasures. Denied
the right to plan their lives and take responsibilities seriously, they
refused to become adult. So with Edward Windsor. The war stunted

heart, which goes up between the bases of the first and second fingers,
gives Miss Cornell deep, unsentimental, sensitive feeling. In its in-
dependence from the line of head, this line of heart indicates that
she has great emotional stability. Her balance allows neither emo-

The line of destiny, which begins with one branch from the mount

The first finger, though smaller than the second, is slightly larger

whatever bitterness there might be from failure to achieve success

symbol of Miss Hurst's ease of expression.

consistent in her emotions, though her feelings are intense. The

Thus, Miss Hurst has at her command three qualities invaluable to
a writer: fluency, observation a basis for realism, and intuitive
understanding. The triangle between the line of destiny and the line

shows Miss Hurst's ability to apply her understanding

Miss Hurst's thumb is a very strong one. The joint is knotty,

one of the luckiest I have ever seen. Not that luck is all there is to
be seen in Lowell Thomas' hand. In type, it is a combination, and a
rather unusual one, of the spatulate and knotty shapes. If you refer
back to the section in which hand types are discussed, you will see
why this combination is out of the ordinary. It means a marriage of
action with thought not just business and administrative ability,
but profound, original thinking.

The heartline, with its fork under the index finger and the many
small leader-lines going into it, is the heartline of a spirited man,
loyal in friendship and well endowed with physical courage. The
thumb shows strong temper, easily aroused but quick to subside.
The line of destiny, starting from the mount of imagination, goes
up to a point between the second and third fingers, indicating that
Mr. Thomas' fate is not altogether under his own control. Yet, fate
has been very kind to him. His career has been aided by friends,
and circumstances have furthered his success.
Lowell Thomas' line of Apollo, which starts from the fortunate
square in the center of his hand and runs up in a number of parallel
branches to the base of his third finger, indicates both luck and
versatility. And notice the star on this line, under the third finger.

imagination which finds expression in the thousand and one humor-

But even more important than the mount of Luna in Disney's
hand is the mount of Apollo, whose fullness is directly under the
Apollo finger. This mount is usually to be found between the base of
the second and third fingers. When it occurs directly under the third
finger it is an exceedingly fortunate indication. In Disney's hand it
probably more than makes up for the absence of the Apollo line.

How to Ma/(e Imprints and Analyze Your Hand
IN
studying your hand, be sure to examine every portion of it, but
let the details confuse you. First, form an estimate of the
do not
hand as a whole, then relate the variations of your lines, fingers,
mounts and markings to that whole.
The back of the hand makes a good starting point, for it will tell
the general type of your hand. Note the length and heaviness of the
fingers in proportion to the palm and in relation to each other.
Examine the joints. Are they prominent, or are the fingers smooth?
What is the quality of your skin? Coarse or fine? But do not let
artificial coarsening of the skin from exposure to cold, wind or ma-
terials used in your work confuse you. Look carefully at the nails.
Now feel the hand and the fingers. Are they stiff and uncompro-
mising or supple? Note whether the fingers bend back easily at all
the points or more at one than at another. Are the fingers wide apart
or close together? Are they straight or crooked? Do some lean or
bend towards others?
Now, turn the hand and look at the palm. What is the first im-
pression you get of it? Is it long and narrow or wide? Is it square,
oval, tapering or sp ready in shape? Notice its color. Look at it in
relief. Are the mounts prominent or is your palm flat in appearance?
Is the flesh firm and elastic or flabby?

Look again at the fingers from the palmar side, repeating all the
observations you made of them from the back. Pay special attention
to the thumb. Is it set low? Is it set free or close to the hand? Is it
long or short, and which is its longest and heaviest phalanx?
Now turn to the lines. First, before examining them individually,
form a general impression of their quality and number. Is your palm
marked with many fine lines or are there few? Are most of them
broad and shallow, feathered,
clear and firm or are they broken

Place a pad of four thicknesses of turkish towelling under the
impression paper. Then put your hand, palm down with the fingers
slightly spread,
on the sensitized sheet. Press down the hand with an
even, light pressure, gently applying extra pressure with the other
hand to the fingertips and palm. Be sure that you do not shift your
hand while you are making the print.
After you have removed your hand, allow the print to dry for
about an hour. When you are quite sure that it is dry, replace your
hand in exactly the same position as you had it in when you made
the print. Now, with a pencil, carefully trace the outline of your hand
as it rests on the paper. When you are finished, you will have a com-
plete print, the impression giving you the lines, markings and emi-
