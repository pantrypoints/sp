Karl Marx was the most consistent translator of the altruist morality into practical action and political theory.

He advocated a society where all would be sacrificed to all through the immediate immolation of the able, the intelligent, the successful and the wealthy.

<!-- —whatever opposition he did
encounter, nobody opposed him on moral grounds.  -->

He was granted the status of a noble, but impractical, idealist.

The great treason of the philosophers was that they, the thinkers, defaulted on
the responsibility of providing a rational society with a code of rational morality.

They, whose job it was to discover and define man’s moral values, stared at the
brilliant torrent of man’s released energy and had nothing better to offer for its
guidance than the Witch Doctor’s morality of human sacrifices—of self-denial,
self-abasement, self-immolation—of suffering, guilt and death.

The failure of philosophers to challenge the Witch Doctor’s morality, has cost
them their kingdom: philosophy. The relationship of reason and morality is
reciprocal: the man who accepts the role of a sacrificial animal, will not achieve
the self-confidence necessary to uphold the validity of his mind—the man who
doubts the validity of his mind, will not achieve the self-esteem necessary to
uphold the value of his person and to discover the moral premises that make
man’s value possible.

The intellectuals share the philosophers’ guilt. The intellectuals—all those
whose professions deal with the “humanities” and require a firm philosophical
base—have known for a long time that no such base existed. They knew that
they were functioning in a philosophical vacuum and that the currency they were
passing was rubber checks which would bounce, some day, wrecking their
culture.

One can never know, only surmise, what tragedies, despair and silent
devastation have been going on for over a century in the invisible underground
of the intellectual professions—in the souls of their practitioners—nor what
incalculable potential of human ability and integrity perished in those hidden,
lonely conflicts. The young minds who came to the field of the intellect with the
inarticulate sense of a crusade, seeking rational answers to the problems of
achieving a meaningful human existence, found a philosophical con game in
place of guidance and leadership. Some of them gave up the field of ideas, in
hopeless, indignant frustration, and vanished into the silence of subjectivity.
Others gave in, and saw their eagerness turn into bitterness, their quest into
apathy, their crusade into a cynical racket. They condemned themselves to the
chronic anxiety of a con man dreading exposure when they accepted the roles of
enlightened leaders, while knowing that their knowledge rested on nothing but
fog and that its only validation was somebody’s feelings.
They, the standard bearers of the mind, found themselves dreading reason as
an enemy, logic as a pursuer, thought as an avenger. They, the proponents of
ideas, found themselves clinging to the belief that ideas were impotent: their
choice was the futility of a charlatan or the guilt of a traitor. They were not
mediocrities when they began their careers; they were pretentious mediocrities
when they ended. The exceptions are growing rarer with every generation. No
one can accept with psychological impunity the function of a Witch Doctor
under the banner of the intellect.

With nothing but quicksands to stand on—the shifting mixture of Witchdoctory and Attila-ism as their philosophical base—the intellectuals were unable
to grasp, to identify or to evaluate the historical drama taking place before them:
the industrial revolution and capitalism. They were like men who did not see the
splendor of a rocket bursting over their heads, because their eyes were lowered
in guilt. It was their job to see and to explain—to a society of men stumbling
dazedly out of a primeval dungeon—the cause and the meaning of the events
that were sweeping them faster and farther than the motion of all the centuries
behind them. The intellectuals did not choose to see.

The men in the other professions were not able to step back and observe. If
some men found themselves leaving their farms for a chance to work in a
factory, that was all they knew. If their children now had a chance to survive
beyond the age of ten (child mortality had been about fifty percent in the pre-
capitalist era), they were not able to identify the cause. They could not tell why
the periodic famines—that had been striking every twenty years to wipe out the
“surplus” population which pre-capitalist economies could not feed—now came
to an end, as did the carnages of religious wars, nor why fear seemed to be lifting
away from people’s voices and from the streets of growing cities, nor why an
enormous exultation was suddenly sweeping the world. The intellectuals did not
choose to tell them.

The intellectuals, or their predominant majority, remained centuries behind
their time: still seeking the favor of noble protectors, some of them were
bewailing the “vulgarity” of commercial pursuits, scoffing at those whose wealth
was “new,” and, simultaneously, blaming these new wealth-makers for all the
poverty inherited from the centuries ruled by the owners of nobly
“noncommercial” wealth. Others were denouncing machines as “inhuman,” and
factories as a blemish on the beauty of the countryside (where gallows had
formerly stood at the crossroads). Still others were calling for a movement “back
to nature,” to the handicrafts, to the Middle Ages. And some were attacking
scientists for inquiring into forbidden “mysteries” and interfering with God’s
design.

The victim of the intellectuals’ most infamous injustice was the businessman.
Having accepted the premises, the moral values and the position of Witch
Doctors, the intellectuals were unwilling to differentiate between the
businessman and Attila, between the producer of wealth and the looter. Like the
Witch Doctor, they scorned and dreaded the realm of material reality, feeling
secretly inadequate to deal with it. Like the Witch Doctor’s, their secret vision
(almost their feared and envied ideal) of a practical, successful man, a true
master of reality, was Attila; like the Witch Doctor, they believed that force,
fraud, lies, plunder, expropriation, enslavement, murder were practical. So they
did not inquire into the source of wealth or ever ask what made it possible (they
had been taught that causality is an illusion and that only the immediate moment
is real). They took it as their axiom, as an irreducible primary, that wealth can be
acquired only by force—and that a fortune as such is the proof of plunder, with
no further distinctions or inquiries necessary.

With their eyes still fixed on the Middle Ages, they were maintaining this in
the midst of a period when a greater amount of wealth than had ever before
existed in the world was being brought into existence all around them. If the men
who produced that wealth were thieves, from whom had they stolen it? Under all
the shameful twists of their evasions, the intellectuals’ answer was: from those
who had not produced it. They were refusing to acknowledge the industrial
revolution (they are still refusing today). They were refusing to admit into their
universe what neither Attila nor the Witch Doctor can afford to admit: the
existence of man, the Producer.

Evading the difference between production and looting, they called the
businessman a robber. Evading the difference between freedom and compulsion,
they called him a slave driver. Evading the difference between reward and terror,
they called him an exploiter. Evading the difference between pay checks and
guns, they called him an autocrat. Evading the difference between trade and
force, they called him a tyrant. The most crucial issue they had to evade was the
difference between the earned and the unearned.

Ignoring the existence of the faculty they were betraying, the faculty of
discrimination, the intellect, they refused to identify the fact that industrial
wealth was the product of man’s mind: that an incalculable amount of
intellectual power, of creative intelligence, of disciplined energy, of human
genius had gone into the creation of industrial fortunes. They could not afford to
identify it, because they could not afford to admit the fact that the intellect is a
practical faculty, a guide to man’s successful existence on earth, and that its task
is the study of reality (as well as the production of wealth), not the
contemplation of unintelligible feelings nor a special monopoly on the
“unknowable.”
