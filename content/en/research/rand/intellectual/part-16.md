This is the speech that Howard Roark makes in his own defense, while on trial
for having dynamited a government housing project under construction; he had
designed the project for another architect, Peter Keating, on the agreement that
it would be built exactly as he designed it; the agreement was broken by the
government agency; the two architects had no recourse to law, not being
permitted to sue the government.


“Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was
probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light. He was
considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. But
thereafter men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light their
caves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness
off the earth. Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably
torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build. He was considered a
transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory. But thereafter, men could
travel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he
had opened the roads of the world.

“That man, the unsubmissive and first, stands in the opening chapter of every
legend mankind has recorded about its beginning. Prometheus was chained to a
rock and torn by vultures—because he had stolen the fire of the gods. Adam was
condemned to suffer—because he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew
that its glory began with one and that that one paid for his courage.
“Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new
roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all
had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed,
and the response they received—hatred. The great creators—the thinkers, the
artists, the scientists, the inventors—stood alone against the men of their time.
Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was
denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered
impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered
sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered
and they paid. But they won.

“No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers, for his brothers
rejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine of their
lives. His truth was his only motive. His own truth, and his own work to achieve
it in his own way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, an airplane or a
building—that was his goal and his life. Not those who heard, read, operated,
believed, flew or inhabited the thing he had created. The creation, not its users.
The creation, not the benefits others derived from it. The creation which gave
form to his truth. He held his truth above all things and against all men.
“His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man’s spirit,
however, is his self. That entity which is his consciousness. To think, to feel, to
judge, to act are functions of the ego.

“The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their power—that it
was self-sufficient, self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount of
energy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The creator served nothing and no one. He
lived for himself.

“And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are
the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.
“Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed.
His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws,
no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant his food or hunt
it. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to
make weapons—a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest
religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and
everything we have comes from a single attribute of man—the function of his
reasoning mind.
“But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a
collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement
reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon
many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act—the
process of reason—must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal
among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use
his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for
another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared
or transferred.

“We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel.
We make a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an
airplane. But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end
product of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes
this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative faculty
cannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual
men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learn from one
another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man can give
another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of survival.
“Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced.
And here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways
—by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of
others. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces nature
alone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary.
“The creator’s concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite’s concern is the
conquest of men.
“The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is
within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become
his prime motive.

“The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot
work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or
subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in
function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.
“The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to
be fed. He places relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve
others. He preaches altruism.
“Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place
others above self.
“No man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot
share his body. But the second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of
exploitation and reversed the base of mankind’s moral principles. Men have been
taught every precept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught dependence
as a virtue.

“The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in
motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces
nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible in concept. The nearest approach
to it in reality—the man who lives to serve others—is the slave. If physical
slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the
spirit? The conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having
resisted and of considering his condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself
voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures. He degrades the dignity
of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the essence of
altruism.

“Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give.
Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before
distribution—or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creator
comes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Yet we are taught to admire
the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who
made the gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of
achievement.

“Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of
others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give
relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering
the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see others suffer—in
order that he may be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism. The creator is not
concerned with disease, but with life. Yet the work of the creators has eliminated
one form of disease after another, in man’s body and spirit, and brought more
relief from suffering than any altruist could ever conceive.
“Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator
is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with
the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have
been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who
stands alone.

“Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness
the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and the
selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act. These are functions
of the self.

“Here the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man
has been left no alternative—and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was
offered two conceptions: egoism and altruism. Egoism was held to mean the
sacrifice of others to self. Altruism—the sacrifice of self to others. This tied man
irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain
borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self.
When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was
closed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal—under the threat that
sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on
mankind.

“This was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as
fundamentals of life.

“The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence or
dependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This is the
basic issue. It rests upon the alternative of life or death. The code of the creator
is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive. The
code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival.
All that which proceeds from man’s independent ego is good. All that which
proceeds from man’s dependence upon men is evil.

“The egoist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is
the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not
function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter.
Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the
source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man—and he asks no other
man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect
possible between men.
