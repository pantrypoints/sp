This is part of a conversation between Francisco d’Anconia and Hank Rearden,
a self-made man who has risen to the position of the country’s greatest steel
industrialist. (Francisco speaking.)

“You, who would not submit to the hardships of nature, but set out to conquer
it and placed it in the service of your joy and your comfort—to what have you
submitted at the hands of men? You, who know from your work that one bears
punishment only for being wrong—what have you been willing to bear and for
what reason? All your life, you have heard yourself denounced, not for your
faults, but for your greatest virtues. You have been hated, not for your mistakes,
but for your achievements. You have been scorned for all those qualities of
character which are your highest pride. You have been called selfish for the
courage of acting on your own judgment and bearing sole responsibility for your
own life. You have been called arrogant for your independent mind. You have
been called cruel for your unyielding integrity. You have been called anti-social
for the vision that made you venture upon undiscovered roads. You have been
called ruthless for the strength and self-discipline of your drive to your purpose.
You have been called greedy for the magnificence of your power to create
wealth. You, who’ve expended an inconceivable flow of energy, have been
called a parasite. You, who’ve created abundance where there had been nothing
but wastelands and helpless, starving men before you, have been called a robber.
You, who’ve kept them all alive, have been called an exploiter. You, the purest
and most moral man among them, have been sneered at as a ‘vulgar materialist.’

Have you stopped to ask them: by what right?—by what code?—by what
standard? No, you have borne it all and kept silent. You bowed to their code and
you never upheld your own. You knew what exacting morality was needed to
produce a single metal nail, but you let them brand you as immoral. You knew
that man needs the strictest code of values to deal with nature, but you thought
that you needed no such code to deal with men. You left the deadliest weapon in
the hands of your enemies, a weapon you never suspected or understood. Their
moral code is their weapon. Ask yourself how deeply and in how many terrible
ways you have accepted it. Ask yourself what it is that a code of moral values
does to a man’s life, and why he can’t exist without it, and what happens to him
if he accepts the wrong standard, by which the evil is the good. Shall I tell you
why you’re drawn to me, even though you think you ought to damn me? It’s
because I’m the first man who has given you what the whole world owes you
and what you should have demanded of all men before you dealt with them: a
moral sanction. . . .

“You’re guilty of a great sin, Mr. Rearden, much guiltier than they tell you,
but not in the way they preach. The worst guilt is to accept an undeserved guilt
—and that is what you have been doing all your life. You have been paying
blackmail, not for your vices, but for your virtues. You have been willing to
carry the load of an unearned punishment—and to let it grow the heavier the
greater the virtues you practiced. But your virtues were those which keep men
alive. Your own moral code—the one you lived by, but never stated,
acknowledged or defended—was the code that preserves man’s existence. If you
were punished for it, what was the nature of those who punished you? Yours was
the code of life. What, then, is theirs? What standard of value lies at its root?
What is its ultimate purpose? Do you think that what you’re facing is merely a
conspiracy to seize your wealth? You, who know the source of wealth, should
know it’s much more and much worse than that. Did you ask me to name man’s
motive power? Man’s motive power is his moral code. Ask yourself where their
code is leading you and what it offers you as your final goal. A viler evil than to
murder a man, is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue. A viler evil than to throw
a man into a sacrificial furnace, is to demand that he leap in, of his own will, and
that he build the furnace, besides. By their own statement, it is they who need
you and have nothing to offer you in return. By their own statement, you must
support them because they cannot survive without you. Consider the obscenity
of offering their impotence and their need—their need of you—as a justification
for your torture. Are you willing to accept it? Do you care to purchase—at the
price of your great endurance, at the price of your agony—the satisfaction of the
needs of your own destroyers? . . .

“If you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw
that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms
trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and
the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders—what
would you tell him to do?”
“I . . . don’t know. What . . . could he do? What would you tell him?”
“To shrug.”

THE MORAL MEANING OF CAPITALISM

This is a statement made by Hank Rearden at his trial for an illegal sale of a
metal alloy which he had created and which has been placed under government
rationing and control.

“I do not want my attitude to be misunderstood. I shall be glad to state it for
the record. . . . I work for nothing but my own profit—which I make by selling a
product they need to men who are willing and able to buy it. I do not produce it
for their benefit at the expense of mine, and they do not buy it for my benefit at
the expense of theirs; I do not sacrifice my interests to them nor do they sacrifice
theirs to me; we deal as equals by mutual consent to mutual advantage—and I
am proud of every penny that I have earned in this manner. I am rich and I am
proud of every penny I own. I have made my money by my own effort, in free
exchange and through the voluntary consent of every man I dealt with—the
voluntary consent of those who employed me when I started, the voluntary
consent of those who work for me now, the voluntary consent of those who buy
my product. I shall answer all the questions you are afraid to ask me openly. 

Do I
wish to pay my workers more than their services are worth to me? I do not. Do I
wish to sell my product for less than my customers are willing to pay me? I do
not. Do I wish to sell it at a loss or give it away? I do not. If this is evil, do
whatever you please about me, according to whatever standards you hold. These
are mine. I am earning my own living, as every honest man must. I refuse to
accept as guilt the fact of my own existence and the fact that I must work in
order to support it. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that I am able to do it and to
do it well. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that I am able to do it better than
most people—the fact that my work is of greater value than the work of my
neighbors and that more men are willing to pay me. I refuse to apologize for my
ability—I refuse to apologize for my success—I refuse to apologize for my
money. If this is evil, make the most of it. If this is what the public finds harmful
to its interests let the public destroy me. This is my code—and I will accept no
other. 

I could say to you that I have done more good for my fellow man than you
can ever hope to accomplish—but I will not say it, because I do not seek the
good of others as a sanction for my right to exist, nor do I recognize the good of
others as a justification for their seizure of my property or their destruction of
my life. I will not say that the good of others was the purpose of my work—my
own good was my purpose, and I despise the man who surrenders his. I could
say to you that you do not serve the public good—that nobody’s good can be
achieved at the price of human sacrifices—that when you violate the rights of
one man, you have violated the rights of all, and a public of rightless creatures is
doomed to destruction. I could say to you that you will and can achieve nothing
but universal devastation—as any looter must, when he runs out of victims. I
could say it, but I won’t. It is not your particular policy that I challenge, but your
moral premise. If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of
turning some men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself
for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood, if I
were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above and against my
own—I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptible evil, I would
fight it with every power I possess, I would fight the whole of mankind, if one
minute were all I could last before I were murdered, I would fight in the full
confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living being’s right to exist. Let
there be no misunderstanding about me. If it is now the belief of my fellow men,
who call themselves the public, that their good requires victims, then I say: The
public good be damned, I will have no part of it!”
