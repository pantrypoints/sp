In a country, double the labour might be required to produce food and necessaries now than in the distant past.

 <!-- at one time, that may be necessary at another, and a distant time; -->

- Yet the labourer's reward might be very little reduced. 

If the labourer's wages in the distant past were a certain quantity of food and necessaries, he probably could not have subsisted if that quantity had been reduced. 

Food and necessaries in this case will have risen 100%.

If estimated by the quantity of labour necessary to their production, while they will scarcely have increased in value, if measured by the quantity of labour for which they will exchange.

In America and Poland, a year's labour will produce much more corn than in England.

If all other necessaries are equally cheap in those 3 countries, it a great mistake to conclude that the quantity of corn awarded to the labourer would be proportional to the facility of production in each country.

If the labourer's shoes and clothing could be produced by 1/4 of the labour due to improvements in machinery, they would probably fall 75%.

But he would not be able to permanently buy 4 coats, or 4 pair of shoes, instead of one.

This is because his wages would also be reduced by competition from the population increase.

<!-- , to the new value of the necessaries on which they were expended.  -->

If these improvements extended to all the objects of the labourer's consumption, at the end of a few years he would have only a small addition to his enjoyments even if the exchangeable value of those commodities were very much reduced through mechanization. 

<!-- , compared with any other commodity, in the manufacture of which no such improvement were made, had sustained a very considerable reduction; and though they were the produce of a very considerably diminished quantity of labour. -->

Adam Smith is therefore wrong: 

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
"that as labour may sometimes purchase more, and sometimes fewer goods. It is their value which varies, not that of the labour which purchases them; that labour alone never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared."
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="Adam Smith was talking about life, not about wages. At all states of society, people want to live and will produce what they produce. Labour here means stress, which is subjective and personal" >}}


But it is correct to say, as Adam Smith had said:

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
that the proportion between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects, seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another
{{< /l >}}


The relative value of commodities is based on the comparative quantity produced. 
- It is not based on the comparative quantities of commodities **GIVEN** to the labourer in exchange for his labour.

A commodity would have an unvarying value if it were produced at all times by the same quantity of labour.
- It would be a standard to measure the variations of the value of other things.*

{{< n n="This is precisely why Smith used corn or grains as the measure of value because all humans need the same amount of grain per day. If we eat 2 cups of rice per meal, we will not likely increase to 4 cups of rice or 0 cups per meal tomorrow. The 2 cups represents the requirement to live daily. A baby might need milk instead of rice. But even its milk will be of a predictable amount" >}}


<!-- Of such a commodity we have no knowledge, and consequently are unable to fix on any standard of value.  -->

<!-- It is, however, of considerable use towards attaining a correct theory, to ascertain  -->

What are the essential qualities of this standard?

 <!-- are, that we may know the causes of the variation in the relative value of commodities, and that we may be enabled to calculate the degree in which they are likely to operate. -->

This standard of all value is labour. 

The relative quantity of labour determines the relative value of commodities.

These include:
- the different qualities of labour
- the difficulty of comparing an hour's, or a day's labour in one employment with the same duration of labour in another


The estimation in which

The different qualities of labour are adjusted in the market.

It depends on:
- the comparative skill of the labourer [quality]
- intensity of the labour performed [quantity]


<!-- with sufficient precision for all practical purposes, and depends much on  -->

The scale, when once formed, is liable to little variation. 

<!-- If a day's labour of a working jeweller be more valuable than a day's labour of a common labourer, it has long ago been adjusted, and placed in its proper position in the scale of value.3 -->

In comparing the value of the same commodity, at different periods of time, the consideration of the comparative skill and intensity of labour required for that commodity needs scarcely to be attended to, as it operates equally at both periods.

One description of labour at one time is compared with the same description of labour at another. If 1/10, 1/5, or 1/4 has been changed, a proportional effect will be produced on the relative value of the commodity.

If a piece of cloth be now of the value of 2 pieces of linen, and if, in 10 years hence, the ordinary value of a piece of cloth should be four pieces of linen, we may safely conclude, that either more labour is required to make the cloth, or less to make the linen, or that both causes have operated.

My inquiry is on the effect of the variations in the relative value of commodities, and not in their absolute value.

<!-- it will be of little importance to examine into the comparative degree of estimation in which the different kinds of human labour are held.  -->

Whatever inequality there was originally in them, whatever the ingenuity, skill, or time necessary for the acquirement of one species of manual dexterity more than another, it continues nearly the same from one generation to another.

Or at least, that the variation is very inconsiderable from year to year, and therefore, can have little effect for short periods on the relative value of commodities.


{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
The proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit in the different employments of labour and stock, seems not to be much affected, as has already been observed, by the riches or poverty, the advancing, stationary, or declining state of the society. Such revolutions in the public welfare, though they affect the general rates both of wages and profit, must in the end affect them equally in all different employments. The proportion between them therefore must remain the same, and cannot well be altered, at least for any considerable time, by any such revolutions.
{{< /l >}}


Adam Smith fully recognized the principle that the proportion between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects, is the only rule for our exchanging them for one another.

Yet he limits its application to "that early and rude state of society, which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land.

As if, when profits and rent were to be paid, they would have some influence on the relative value of commodities, independent of the mere quantity of labour that was necessary to their production.

Adam Smith, however, has not analyzed how relative value is affected by:
- the accumulation of capital
- the appropriation of land

How far are the effects produced on the exchangeable value of commodities, by the comparative quantity of labour bestowed on their production, are modified or altered by the accumulation of capital and the payment of rent?

1. The accumulation of capital

Even in that early state to which Adam Smith refers, some capital, though possibly made and accumulated by the hunter himself would be necessary to enable him to kill his game. 

Without some weapon, neither the beaver nor the deer could be destroyed, and therefore the value of these animals would be regulated, not solely by the time and labour necessary to their destruction, but also by the time and labour necessary for providing the hunter's capital, the weapon, by the aid of which their destruction was effected.

Suppose that is is harder to come close to a beaver to kill it than to a deer. 
- A beaver-killing weapon will need a longer killing range. 
- This range would need more labour to produce.

This would give the beaver more value than 2 deer.

This is why more labour would on the whole be necessary to its destruction.

{{< n n="Beavers would be more expensive. But this would not mean that beavers would be more in demand. It is more expensive to go to Pluto than to Mars. Yet there is no demand for Pluto-travel and so there are no missions being funded to go to Pluto. Likewise, it is cheaper to go to the moon than to Mars. Yet there is more funding for Mars missions than moon missions." >}}


<!-- All the implements necessary to kill the beaver and deer might belong to one class of men, and the labour employed in their destruction might be furnished by another class; still, their comparative prices would be in proportion to the actual labour bestowed, both on the formation of the capital, and on the destruction of the animals.  -->

There can be differences in the availability of capital versus the avaialability of labour.


<!-- Under different circumstances of plenty or scarcity of capital, as compared with labour, under different circumstances of plenty or scarcity of the food and necessaries essential to the support of men, those who furnished an equal value of -->

Those who invested capital for labour-intesive products might have less produce than those who invested for capital-intensive products.

<!-- products for either one employment or for the other, might have a half, a fourth, or an eighth of the produce obtained, the remainder being paid as wages to those who furnished the labour;  -->

Yet this division could not affect the relative value of those products which would always have the same ratios. 

 <!-- commodities, since whether the profits of capital were greater or less, whether they were 50, 20, or 10 per cent., or whether the wages of labour were high or low, they would operate equally on both employments. -->

Assume that fishing and agriculture were mechanized. 

<!-- If we suppose the occupations of the society extended, that some provide canoes and tackle necessary for fishing, others the seed and rude machinery first used in agriculture, still  -->

The same principle would hold true: the exchangeable value of the fish would have the same ratio to crops. 

 <!-- commodities produced would be in proportion to the labour bestowed on their production; not on their19 immediate production only, but on all those implements or machines required to give effect to the particular labour to which they were applied. -->

In improved societies where arts and commerce flourish, commodities vary in value conformably with this principle.

The comparative exchangeable value of stockings depends on the labour for manufacturing them and bringing them to market. 

1. There is the labour necessary to cultivate the land on which the raw cotton is grown

2. The labour of conveying the cotton to the country where the stockings are to be manufactured, which includes a portion of the labour bestowed in building the ship in which it is conveyed, and which is charged in the freight of the goods.

3. The labour of the spinner and weaver

4. A portion of the labour of the engineer, smith, and carpenter, who erected the buildings and machinery, by the help of which they are made

5. The labour of the retail dealer, and of many others, whom it is unnecessary further to particularize.

The aggregate sum of these various kinds of labour, determines the quantity of other things for which these stockings will exchange, while the same consideration of the various quantities of labour which have been bestowed on those other things, will equally govern the portion of them which will be given for the stockings.
