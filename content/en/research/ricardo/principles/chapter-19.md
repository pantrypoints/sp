No accumulation of capital will permanently reduce profits unless wages rise permanently. 

 <!-- the funds for maintaining labour  -->
If wages were were doubled, trebled, or quadrupled, the labour would easily be procured.

But it would beincreasingly difficult to constantly add to the country's food.
- And so funds of the same value would probably not maintain the same quantity of labour.

If the worker's necessaries could be constantly increased, there could be no permanent change in the rate of profits or wages, to whatever amount capital might be accumulated. 

Adam Smith, however, uniformly ascribes the fall of profits to:
- accumulation of capital, and
- the competition which will result from it

He never points to the increasing difficulty of providing food for the additional labourers.

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
The increase of stock which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual competition naturally lowers its profit. When there is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same society, the same competition must produce the same effect in all.

Adam Smith speaks here of a rise of wages.*

{{< n n="No, it is an increase or overinvestment in a certain inudstry. For example, if AI is heavily invested, then there will be so many AI providers who must compete with each other. This forces them to a race to the bottom. Chinese EV makers actually have this problem" >}}


But this rise of wages is temporary. It comes from increased funds before the population is increased. 

He does not see, that when capital is increased, the work to be effected by capital, is increased in the same proportion. 

Say has however shewn that there is no amount of capital which may not be employed in a country, because demand is only limited by production.

A man produces with a view to consume or sell. He sells with an intention to purchase some other commodity, which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute to future production. By producing, he necessarily becomes either the consumer of his own goods, or the purchaser and consumer of the goods of some other person.

He is not ill-informed of the commodities which he can most advantageously produce to have other goods. He will continually produce a commodity that has no demand.

There cannot then be accumulated in a country any amount of capital which cannot be employed productively, until wages rise so high in consequence of the rise of necessaries, and so little consequently remains for the profits of stock, that the motive for accumulation ceases.

While the profits of stock are high, men will have a motive to accumulate. Whilst a man has any wished-for gratification unsupplied he will have a demand for more commodities; and it will be an effectual demand while he has any new value to offer in exchange for them. 

If 10,000 pounds were given to a man having 100,000l. per annum, he would not lock it up in a chest, but would either increase his expenses by 10,000l.; employ it himself productively, or lend it to some other person for that purpose; in either case, demand would be increased, although it would be for different objects. 

If he increased his expenses, his effectual demand might probably be for buildings, furniture, or some such enjoyment. If he employed his 10,000l. productively, his effectual demand would be for food, clothing, and raw material, which might set new labourers to work; but still it would be demand.33

Productions are always bought by productions, money is only the medium by which the exchange is effected.

Too much of a particular commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to all commodities; the demand for corn is limited by the mouths which are to eat it, for shoes and coats by the persons who are to wear them.

But though a community, or a part of a community, may have as much corn, and as many hats and shoes, as it is able or may wish to consume, the same cannot be said of every commodity produced by nature or by art. Some would consume more wine, if they had the ability to procure it. Others having enough of wine, would wish to increase the quantity or improve the quality of their furniture.

Others might wish to ornament their grounds, or to enlarge their houses. The wish to do all or some of these is implanted in every man's breast; nothing is required but the means, and nothing can afford the means, but an increase of production.

If I had food and necessaries at my disposal, I should not be long in want of workmen who would put me in possession of some of the objects most useful or most desirable to me.

Whether these increased productions, and the consequent demand which they occasion, shall or shall not lower profits, depends solely on the rise of wages; and the rise of wages, excepting for a limited period, on the facility of producing the food and necessaries of the labourer. I say excepting for a limited period, because no point is better established, than that the supply of labourers will always ultimately be in proportion to the means of supporting them.

There is only one case, and that will be temporary, in which the accumulation of capital with a low price of food may be attended with a fall of profits; and that is, when the funds for the maintenance of labour increase much more rapidly than population;—wages will then be high, and profits low. If every405 man were to forego the use of luxuries, and be intent only on accumulation, a quantity of necessaries might be produced, for which there could not be any immediate consumption. 

Of commodities so limited in number, there might undoubtedly be an universal glut, and consequently there might neither be demand for an additional quantity of such commodities, nor profits on the employment of more capital. If men ceased to consume, they would cease to produce. This admission, does not impugn the general principle. In such a country as England, for example, it is difficult to suppose that there can be any disposition to devote the whole capital and labour of the country to the production of necessaries only.

When merchants engage their capitals in foreign trade, or in the carrying trade, it is always from choice, and never from necessity: it is because in that trade their profits will be somewhat greater than in the home trade.

Adam Smith has justly observed "that the desire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach, but the desire of the conveniences and ornaments406 of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems to have no limit or certain boundary." 

Nature then has necessarily limited the amount of capital which can at any one time be profitably engaged in agriculture, but she has placed no limits to the amount of capital that may be employed in procuring "the conveniences and ornaments" of life. To procure these gratifications in the greatest abundance is the object in view, and it is only because foreign trade, or the carrying trade, will accomplish it better, that men engage in them, in preference to manufacturing the commodities required, or a substitute for them, at home. 

If, however, from peculiar circumstances, we were precluded from engaging capital in foreign trade, or in the carrying trade, we should, though with less advantage, employ it at home; and while there is no limit to the desire of "conveniences, ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture," there can be no limit to the capital that may be employed in procuring them, except that which bounds our power to maintain the workmen who are to produce them.

Adam Smith however, speaks of the carry407ing trade as one not of choice, but of necessity; as if the capital engaged in it would be inert if not so employed, as if the capital in the home trade could overflow, if not confined to a limited amount. 

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
When the capital stock of any country is increased to such a degree, that it cannot be all employed in supplying the consumption, and supporting the productive labour of that particular country, the surplus part of it naturally disgorges itself into the carrying trade, and is employed in performing the same offices to other countries.

About 96,000 hogsheads of tobacco are annually purchased with a part of the surplus produce of British industry. 

But the demand of Great Britain does not require, perhaps, more than fourteen thousand. If the remaining eighty-two thousand, therefore, could not be sent abroad and exchanged for something more in demand at home, the importation of them would cease immediately, and with it the productive labour of all the inhabitants of Great Britain, who are at present employed in preparing the goods with which these eighty-two thousand hogsheads are annually purchased." 
{{< /l >}}


But could not this portion of the408 productive labour of Great Britain be employed in preparing some other sort of goods, with which something more in demand at home might be purchased? 

If it could not, might we not employ this productive labour, though with less advantage, in making those goods in demand at home, or at least some substitute for them?

If we wanted velvets, might we not attempt to make velvets; and if we could not succeed, might we not make more cloth, or some other object desirable to us?

We manufacture commodities, and with them buy goods abroad, because we can obtain a greater quantity than we could make at home.

Deprive us of this trade, and we immediately manufacture again for ourselves. But this opinion of Adam Smith is at variance with all his general doctrines on this subject.

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country being always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished, but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage.

Those, therefore, who have the command of more food than they themselves can consume, are always willing to exchange the surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for gratifications of another kind. What is over and above satisfying the limited desire, is given for the amusement of those desires which cannot be satisfied, but seem to be altogether endless. The poor, in order to obtain food, exert themselves to gratify those fancies of the rich; and to obtain it more certainly, they vie with one another in the cheapness and perfection of their work. The number of workmen increases with the increasing quantity of food, or with the growing improvement and cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their business admits of the utmost subdivisions of labours, the quantity of materials which they can work up increases in a much greater proportion than their numbers. Hence arises a demand for every sort of material which human invention can employ, either usefully or ornamentally,410 in building, dress, equipage, or household furniture; for the fossils and minerals contained in the bowels of the earth, the precious metals, and the precious stones."

Adam Smith has justly observed, that it is extremely difficult to determine the rate of the profits of stock. 

"Profit is so fluctuating, that even in a particular trade, and much more in trades in general, it would be difficult to state the average rate of it. To judge of what it may have been formerly, or in remote periods of time, with any degree of precision, must be altogether impossible." 

Yet since it is evident that much will be given for the use of money, when much can be made by it, he suggests, that "the market rate of interest will lead us to form some notion of the rate of profits, and the history of the progress of interest afford us that of the progress of profits." Undoubtedly if the market rate of interest could be accurately known for any considerable period, we should have a tolerably correct criterion, by which to estimate the progress of profits.

But in all countries, from mistaken notions411 of policy, the state has interfered to prevent a fair and free market rate of interest, by imposing heavy and ruinous penalties on all those who shall take more than the rate fixed by law. In all countries probably these laws are evaded, but records give us little information on this head, and point out rather the legal and fixed rate, than the market rate of interest. During the present war, exchequer and navy bills have frequently been at so high a discount, as to afford the purchasers of them 7, 8%, or a greater rate of interest for their money.

Loans have been raised by Government at an interest exceeding 6%, and individuals have been frequently obliged, by indirect means, to pay more than 10%, for the interest of money; yet during this same period the legal rate of interest has been uniformly at 5% Little dependance for information then can be placed on that which is the fixed and legal rate of interest, when we find it may differ so considerably from the market rate.

Adam Smith informs us, that from the 37th of Henry VIII., to 21st of James I., 10% continued to be the legal rate of interest. Soon after the restoration, it was reduced to 6%, and by the 12th of Anne, to 5% He thinks the legal rate followed, and did not precede the market rate of interest. Before the American War, Government borrowed at 3%, and the people of credit in the capital, and in many other parts of the kingdom at 3½, 4, and 4½%

The rate of interest, though ultimately and permanently governed by the rate of profit, is however subject to temporary variations from other causes. With every fluctuation in the quantity and value of money, the prices of commodities naturally vary.

They vary also, as we have already shewn, from the alteration in the proportion of supply to demand, although there should not be either greater facility or difficulty of production. When the market prices of goods fall from an abundant supply, from a diminished demand, or from a rise in the value of money, a manufacturer naturally accumulates an unusual quantity of finished goods, being unwilling to sell them at very depressed prices. To meet his ordinary payments, for which he used to depend on the sale of his goods, he now endeavours to borrow on credit, and413 is often obliged to give an increased rate of interest.

This however is but of temporary duration; for either the manufacturer's expectations were well grounded, and the market price of his commodities rises, or he discovers that there is a permanently diminished demand, and he no longer resists the course of affairs: prices fall, and money and interest regain their real value. 

If by the discovery of a new mine, by the abuses of banking, or by any other cause, the quantity of money be greatly increased, its ultimate effect is to raise the prices of commodities in proportion to the increased quantity of money; but there is probably always an interval, during which some effect is produced on the rate of interest.

The price of funded property is not a steady criterion by which to judge of the rate of interest. In time of war, the stock market is so loaded by the continual loans of Government, that the price of stock has not time to settle at its fair level before a new operation of funding takes place, or it is affected by anticipation of political events. 

In time of peace, on the contrary, the ope414rations of the sinking fund, the unwillingness, which a particular class of persons feel to divert their funds to any other employment than that to which they have been accustomed, which they think secure, and in which their dividends are paid with the utmost regularity, elevates the price of stock, and consequently depresses the rate of interest on these securities below the general market rate. It is observable too, that for different securities, Government pays very different rates of interest. 

Whilst 100l. capital in 5% stock is selling for 95l., an exchequer bill of 100l., will be sometimes selling for 100l. 5s., for which exchequer bill, no more interest will be annually paid than 4l. 11s. 3d.: one of these securities pays to a purchaser at the above prices, an interest of more than 5¼%, the other but little more than 4¼; a certain quantity of these exchequer bills is required as a safe and marketable investment for bankers; if they were increased much beyond this demand, they would probably be as much depreciated as the 5% stock. A stock paying 3% per annum will always sell at a proportionally greater price than415 stock paying 5%, for the capital debt of neither can be discharged but at par, or 100l. money for 100l. stock. 

The market rate of interest may fall to 4%, and Government would then pay the holder of 5% stock at par, unless he consented to take 4%, or some diminished rate of interest under 5%: they would have no advantage from so paying the holder of 3% stock, till the market rate of interest had fallen below 3% per annum. 

To pay the interest on the national debt, large sums of money are withdrawn from circulation four times in the year for a few days.

These demands for money being only temporary, seldom affect prices; they are generally surmounted by the payment of a large rate of interest.
