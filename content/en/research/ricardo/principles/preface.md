The produce of the earth is derived by the united application of labour, machinery, and capital.

This is divided among 3 classes of the community:

1. The proprietor of the land
2. The owner of the stock or capital necessary for its cultivation
3. The labourers by whose industry it is cultivated.



The proportions of the whole produce of the earth will be allotted to each of these classes as rent, profit, and wages. 

These will be different in different stages of society, depending on:
- the fertility of the soil
- the accumulation of capital and population
- the skill, ingenuity, and instruments employed in agriculture.


The principal problem in Political Economy is to determine the laws which regulate this distribution.

This science has been improved by the writings of Turgot, Stuart, Smith, Say, Sismondi, and others.

But they afford very little satisfactory information respecting the natural course of rent, profit, and wages.



In 1815, the true doctrine of rent was presented to the world by:
- Malthus in his "Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent"
- a Fellow of University College, Oxford, in "Essay on the Application of Capital to Land" 

<!-- without a knowledge of which it is impossible to understand the effect of the progress of wealth on profits and wages, or to trace satisfactorily the influence of taxation on different classes of the community, particularly when the commodities taxed are the productions immediately derived from the surface of the earth. -->

Adam Smith, and the other able writers I have mentioned did not correctly view the principles of rent.

<!-- - , have, it appears to me, overlooked many important truths, which can only be discovered after the subject of rent is thoroughly understood. -->

To correct them, I will state my opinions on the laws of profits and wages, and on the operation of taxes.

<!-- supply this deficiency, abilities are required of a far superior cast to any possessed by the writer of the following pages; yet after having given to this subject his best consideration—after the aid which he has derived from the works of the above-mentioned eminent writers—and after the valuable experience which a few late years, abounding in facts, have yielded to the present generation—it will not, he trusts, be deemed presumptuous in him to state his  -->

<!-- If the principles which he deems correct should be found to be so, it will be for others more able than himself to trace them to all their important consequences. -->

I combat received opinions. I cite the passages from Adam Smith that I differ in. 

<!--  from which he sees reason to differ;

but he hopes it will not on that account be suspected that he does not, in common with all those who acknowledge the importance of the science of Political Economy, participate in the admiration which the profound vi work of this celebrated author so justly excites. -->

<!-- The same remark may be applied to the excellent works of  -->

M. Say was among the first of continental writers who applied Smith's principles.

But also he had some mistakes. 

<!--  , and who has done more than all other continental writers taken together, to recommend the principles of that enlightened and beneficial system to the nations of Europe; 

but who has succeeded in placing the science in a more logical, and more instructive order; and has enriched it by several discussions, original, accurate, and profound.1 The respect, however, which the author entertains for the writings of this gentleman, has not prevented him from commenting with that freedom which he thinks the interests of science require, on such passages of the "Economie Politique," as appeared at variance with his own ideas. -->
