A superior intelligence beholding all the passions of men, without experiencing any of them, is needed to discover the rules of society best suited to nations.  

This intelligence would have to be wholly unrelated to our nature, while knowing it through and through; 

its happiness would have to be independent of us, and yet ready to occupy itself with ours; and lastly, it would have, in the march of time, to look forward to a distant glory, and, working in one century, to be able to enjoy in the next.[1] It would take gods to give men laws.

What Caligula argued from the facts, Plato, in the dialogue called the Politicus, argued in defining the civil or kingly man, on the basis of right.

Great princes are rare. They only follow the pattern laid down by great legislators, which are rarer. 

 <!-- how much more so are great ? The former have  which the latter have to lay down.  -->

The legislator is the engineer who invents the machine.

The prince is merely the mechanic who sets it up and makes it go.

Montesquieu says "At the birth of societies, the rulers of Republics establish institutions, and afterwards the institutions mould the rulers."[2]

A creator of a people's institutions should feel capable of:
- changing human nature
- transforming each individual into a part of a greater whole
- altering man's constitution to strengthen it
- substituting a partial and moral existence for the physical and independent existence nature has conferred on us all.

He must take away from man his own resources and give to those alien to him.

<!-- , and incapable of being made use of without the help of other men. -->

Legislation is perfect when:
- each citizen is nothing and can do nothing without the rest
- the resources acquired by the whole are more than the invidual resources added up
- the more completely these [individual] natural resources are annihilated in favor of the aggregate

<!--  the greater and the more lasting are those which he acquires, and 

 the more stable and perfect the new institutions;  -->
 
 <!-- to the aggregate of the resources of all the individuals, it may be said that -->

<!-- The legislator occupies in every respect an extraordinary position in the State.

If he should do so by reason of his genius, he does so no less by reason of his office, which is neither magistracy, nor Sovereignty.  -->


### [Separation of Powers]

<!-- The office of legislator sets up the Republic but does not write its constitution. -->

<!-- it is an individual and superior function, which has nothing in common with human empire; for if he who holds -->

The commander of men should not write the laws and vice versa.

 <!-- he who has command over the laws ought not any more to have it over men; or else -->

Otherwise, his laws would:
- be the ministers of his passions 
- perpetuate his injustices

His private aims would inevitably mar the sanctity of his work.

When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by resigning the throne.

It was the custom of most Greek towns to entrust the establishment of their laws to foreigners. The Republics of modern Italy in many cases followed this example.

Geneva did the same and profited by it.[3] 

Rome, when it was most prosperous, suffered all the crimes of tyranny because it put the legislative authority and the sovereign power into the same hands.

<!-- Nevertheless, the decemvirs themselves never claimed the right to pass any law merely on their own authority. "Nothing we propose to you," they said to the people, "can pass into law without your consent. Romans, be yourselves the authors of the laws which are to make you happy."

He, therefore, who draws up the laws has, or should have, no right of legislation, and the people cannot, even if it wishes, deprive itself of this incommunicable right, because, according to the fundamental compact, only the general will can bind the individuals, and there can be no assurance that a particular will is in conformity with the general will, until it has been put to the free vote of the people. This I have said already; but it is worth while to repeat it. -->

<!-- Thus in the task of legislation we find together two things which appear to be incompatible: an enterprise too difficult for human powers, and, for its execution, an authority that is no authority.

There is a further difficulty that deserves attention. Wise men, if they try to speak their language to the common herd instead of its own, cannot possibly make themselves understood. There are a thousand kinds of ideas which it is impossible to translate into popular language. 

Conceptions that are too general and objects that are too remote are equally out of its range: each individual, having no taste for any other plan of government than that which suits his particular interest, finds it difficult to realise the advantages he might hope to draw from the continual privations good laws impose.

For a young people to be able to relish sound principles of political theory and follow the fundamental rules of statecraft, the effect would have to become the cause; the social spirit, which should be created by these institutions, would have to preside over their very foundation; and men would have to be before law what they should become by means of law.  -->

The people submit to the laws of the State as to those of nature.

The legislator when unable to appeal to either force or reason, must have recourse to a divine authority.

<!--  of a different order capable of constraining without violence and persuading without convincing.

This is what has, in all ages, compelled the fathers of nations to have recourse to divine intervention and  -->

They credit the gods with their own wisdom so that the people might obey freely, and bear with docility the yoke of the public happiness.


<!-- , and recognising the same power in the formation of the city as in that of man, -->

<!-- This sublime reason, far above the range of the common herd, is that whose decisions the legislator puts into the mouth of the immortals, in order to constrain by divine authority those whom human prudence could not move.[4] -->

But not everybody who can get himself believed to be speaking for God.

 <!-- when he proclaims himself their interpreter.  -->

<!-- The great soul of the legislator is the only miracle that can prove his mission. Any man may grave tablets of stone, or buy an oracle; or feign secret intercourse with some divinity, or train a bird to whisper in his ear, or find other vulgar ways of imposing on the people. He whose knowledge goes no further may perhaps gather round him a band of fools; but he will never found an empire, and his extravagances will quickly perish with him. Idle tricks form a passing tie; only wisdom can make it lasting.  -->

 <!-- and that of the child of Ishmael, which, -->

The Judaic law still subsists. The Arabs for 10 centuries have ruled half the world.

 <!-- still proclaim the great men who laid them down; and, while the pride of philosophy or the blind spirit of faction sees in them no more than lucky impostures, the true political theorist admires, in the institutions they set up, the great and powerful genius which presides over things made to endure. -->

We should not, with Warburton, conclude from this that politics and religion have among us a common object, but that, in the first periods of nations, the one is used as an instrument for the other.

<!-- [1] A people becomes famous only when its legislation begins to decline. We do not know for how many centuries the system of Lycurgus made the Spartans happy before the rest of Greece took any notice of it.

[3] Those who know Calvin only as a theologian much underestimate the extent of his genius. The codification of our wise edicts, in which he played a large part, does him no less honour than his Institute. Whatever revolution time may bring in our religion, so long as the spirit of patriotism and liberty still lives among us, the memory of this great man will be for ever blessed.

[4] "In truth," says Macchiavelli, "there has never been, in any country, an extraordinary legislator who has not had recourse to God; for otherwise his laws would not have been accepted: there are, in fact, many useful truths of which a wise man may have knowledge without their having in themselves such clear reasons for their being so as to be able to convince others" (Discourses on Livy, Bk. v, ch. xi). (Rousseau quotes the Italian.) -->
