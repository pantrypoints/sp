Every system of legislation should aim for the greatest good of all as:

1. Liberty

This is because all particular dependence means so much force taken from the body of the State.

2. Equality

This is because liberty cannot exist without it.

<!-- I have already defined civil liberty; by  -->


Equality does not mean that everyone is identical in power and riches.

Equality is:
- when power:
  - is never great enough for violence
  - is always exercised by virtue of rank and law
- when riches is not so imbalanced so that:
  - no citizen shall ever be wealthy enough to buy another, and none poor enough to be forced to sell himself


The great should be regulated in goods and position.

The common sort should be regulated in avarice and covetousness.

People say that such equality is an unpractical ideal that cannot actually exist.

But I think that we should aim for it anyway. 

 <!-- if its abuse is inevitable, does it follow hat we should not at least make regulations concerning it? It is precisely because the force of circumstances tends continually to destroy equality that the force of legislation should always tend to its maintenance. -->

These 2 aims vary in every country in accordance with the local situation and the temper of the inhabitants.

<!-- These circumstances should determine, in each case, the particular system of institutions which is best, not perhaps in itself, but for the State for which it is destined. -->

A nation with barren soil and crowded lands should turn to industry and the crafts, and trade what they produce.

A fertile nation that lacks inhabitants should:
- focus on agriculture to increase its population
- drive out the crafts, which would only result in depopulation, by grouping in a few localities the few inhabitants there are.[2] 

A coastal nation should cover the sea with ships and foster commerce and navigation.

 <!-- It will have a life that will be short and glorious. -->

An inaccessible coastal nation should remain barbarous and ichthyophagous.

 <!-- it will have a quieter, perhaps a better, and certainly a happier life.  -->

Every nation has in itself something that gives them a particular application, and makes its legislation peculiarly its own.

Nation | Focus
--- | ---
Jews and Arabs | religion
Athenians | letters
Carthage and Tyre | commerce
Rhodes | shipping
Sparta | war
Rome | Virtue

 <!-- The author of The Spirit of the Laws has shown with many examples by what art the legislator directs the constitution towards each of these objects. -->

The constitution of a State is made solid and lasting by its due observance of the agreement of the natural relations.
- The law assures, accompaniess and rectifies them on every point.


But if the legislator mistakes his object and adopts a principle other than circumstances naturally direct; if his principle makes for servitude while they make for liberty, or if it makes for riches, while they make for populousness, or if it makes for peace, while they make for conquest—the laws will insensibly lose their influence, the constitution will alter, and the State will have no rest from trouble till it is either destroyed or changed, and nature has resumed her invincible sway.

<!-- 
[1] If the object is to give the State consistency, bring the two extremes as near to each other as possible; allow neither rich men nor beggars. These two estates, which are naturally inseparable, are equally fatal to the common good; from the one come the friends of tyranny, and from the other tyrants. It is always between them that public liberty is put up to auction; the one buys, and the other sells.

[2] "Any branch of foreign commerce," says M. d'Argenson, "creates on the whole only apparent advantage for the kingdom in general; it may enrich some individuals, or even some towns; but the nation as a whole gains nothing by it, and the people is no better off." -->


### CHAPTER 12: THE DIVISION OF THE LAWS

<!-- If the whole is to be set in order, and the commonwealth put into the best possible shape, there are various relations to be considered. First, there is the action of the complete body upon itself, the relation of the whole to the whole, of  -->

What is the relation of the Sovereign to the State?

This relation is made up of the relations of the intermediate terms.

The laws which regulate this relation bear the name of political laws, and are also called fundamental laws, not without reason if they are wise.

For, if there is, in each State, only one good system, the people that is in possession of it should hold fast to this; but if the established order is bad, why should laws that prevent men from being good be regarded as fundamental?

Besides, in any case, a people is always in a position to change its laws, however good; for, if it choose to do itself harm, who can have a right to stop it?

The second relation is that of the members one to another, or to the body as a whole; and this relation should be in the first respect as unimportant, and in the second as important, as possible.

Each citizen would then be perfectly independent of all the rest, and at the same time very dependent on the city; which is brought about always by the same means, as the strength of the State can alone secure the liberty of its members. From this second relation arise civil laws.

We may consider also a third kind of relation between the individual and the law, a relation of disobedience to its penalty.

This gives rise to the setting up of criminal laws, which, at bottom, are less a particular class of law than the sanction behind all the rest.

Along with these three kinds of law goes a fourth, most important of all, which is not graven on tablets of marble or brass, but on the hearts of the citizens.

This forms the real constitution of the State, takes on every day new powers, when other laws decay or die out, restores them or takes their place, keeps a people in the ways in which it was meant to go, and insensibly replaces authority by the force of habit.

I am speaking of morality, of custom, above all of public opinion; a power unknown to political thinkers, on which none the less success in everything else depends.

With this the great legislator concerns himself in secret, though he seems to confine himself to particular regulations; for these are only the arc of the arch, while manners and morals, slower to arise, form in the end its immovable keystone.

<!-- Among the different classes of laws, the political, which determine the form of the government, are alone relevant to my subject. -->
