The executive power is:
- established after the legislative power is well established.
- naturally separate from the legislative


If the Sovereign possesses the executive power, right and fact would be so confounded.
- No one could tell what was law and what was not.
- The body politic would be disfigured. 
  - It would soon fall a prey to the violence it was instituted to prevent.

The social contract says that:
- all the citizens are equal
- all can prescribe what all should do
- but no one has a right to demand that another shall do what he does not do himself. 

This right:
- is indispensable for giving the body politic life and movement.
- is given to the prince by the Sovereign, in instituting the government

This act of establishment was a contract between the people and the rulers it sets over itself.

It is a contract in which conditions were laid down between the two parties binding the one to command and the other to obey.

It will be admitted, I am sure, that this is an odd kind of contract to enter into. 

But let us see if this view can be upheld.

First, the supreme authority can no more be modified than it can be alienated; to limit it is to destroy it. It is absurd and contradictory for the Sovereign to set a superior over itself; to bind itself to obey a master would be to return to absolute liberty.

Moreover, it is clear that this contract between the people and such and such persons would be a particular act; and from this it follows that it can be neither a law nor an act of Sovereignty, and that consequently it would be illegitimate.

It is plain too that the contracting parties in relation to each other would be under the law of nature alone and wholly without guarantees of their mutual undertakings, a position wholly at variance with the civil state. He who has force at his command being always in a position to control execution, it would come to the same thing if the name "contract" were given to the act of one man who said to another; "I give you all my goods, on condition that you give me back as much of them as you please."

There is only one contract in the State, and that is the act of association, which in itself excludes the existence of a second. It is impossible to conceive of any public contract that would not be a violation of the first.
