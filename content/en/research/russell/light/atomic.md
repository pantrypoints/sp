The elements of matter are not different substances or different things. 

They are different pressure conditions of light waves. The light units of the elements are all alike but are differently conditioned by the electric pressures exerted upon them during the inward or outward spiral journey from zero to zero.

The unanswered mystery of how the elements become mathematically precise octave tones, just as musical
tones or color tones of the spectrum are mathematically precise in vibration orderliness, lies in the wave field gyroscopic principle.

Together the eight elements of an octave form two halves of one whole cycle of tones which ascend from
zero to the four-zero-four position of amplitude and then descend again to zero to begin anew.
This spiral journey contracts into greater pressures as it approaches wave field amplitude positions at spiral
apices, and expands into lower ones on the return journey to spiral bases.
That two-way spiral journey of each half cycle extends between six mirrors of still Light which compose
the wave field, and winds around a still shaft which centers the spiral. Three of these mirrors are the mirrors
of action and three are the mirrors of reaction. (Fig. 75)

The three of action are the inner
intersection planes of the cube and the
three of reaction are the outer boundary
planes of the wave field.

All of these planes of the wave field are of zero curvature, but the spiral universe which is forming within those planes is curved. Curved planes of light act as
two-way lenses which bend light to
focal points and extend it from those
focal points radially.

As the two-way spirals of forming
matter extend from the wave field
center in opposite directions toward
wave field intersections, the six mirror
planes of still light focus three points of
still light upon the still shaft of each half
cycle. Centers are formed at these focal
points which become the one, two, three
positive and negative elements of matter by rotating gyroscopically upon the wheels of light which act as
equators for those horning tones.

Multiplying and dividing pressures determine the density and volume of each succeeding element. The
color spectrum records these pressures as the complete history of every element from octave to octave of
the whole nine octave cycle of the elements.
Multiplying pressures of the spiral also affect the curvature of its light lenses to such an extent that the
focusing positions change their mathematical ratios in conformity with the acceleration of gravity and the
deceleration of radiation.

The positions of focal centers of gyroscopic wheels
upon the wave shaft are thus affected as diagrammed
in Fig. 76 and Fig. 72. Each element is the square of
the distance to and from its succeeding one, in accordance with its direction. The direction of gravity is the
inverse square, and the opposite direction is the direct
square.

The volume of each succeeding element is likewise
affected directly and inversely as the cube.
Six of the eight gyroscopic wheels of the whole
octave are thus accounted for by geometric projection
