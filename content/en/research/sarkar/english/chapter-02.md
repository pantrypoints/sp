An article is a word generally used before a noun or a noun-equivalent. 

Generally, 3 kinds of articles are recognized in English grammar:

1. Definite
2. Indefinite (general)
3. Numeral

Some think that an article is a kind of adjective, but not everyone agrees.

Definite article: The, that, those may be treated as definite articles.

## Indefinite (general) article

## Numeral article

Here Seven hundred (700) is a numeral article.
