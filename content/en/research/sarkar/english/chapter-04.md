When a word denotes only one object, it is singular in number. When it denotes more than one object, it is plural in number.

## Rule 1

The general rule for forming plurals is to add -s to the word in the singular number:


SINGULAR | PLURAL
--- | ---
dog	| dogs
book | books
hand | hands
house | houses
town | towns
village | villages

Exceptions: If the noun ends in -ss, -sh, -ch, -x or -z, the plural is formed by adding -es to the singular:

SINGULAR | PLURAL
--- | ---
class | classes
glass | glasses
bench | benches
brush | brushes
box	| boxes
fox	| foxes
topaz |	topazes


## Rule 2

If the last letter of the noun is -y and if -y is preceded by a consonant, the plural is formed by changing -y into -ies:

SINGULAR | PLURAL
--- | ---
fly	| flies
sky	| skies
lady | ladies
family | families
city | cities

But if the final -y is preceded by a vowel, the plural is formed by adding only -s to the word in the singular number:

SINGULAR | PLURAL
--- | ---
day	| days
tray | trays
key	| keys
monkey | monkeys
boy	| boys

echo | echoes
mango | mangoes
mosquito | mosquitoes

wife | wives
calf | calves
knife | knives
leaf | leaves
wolf | wolves
thief | thieves

Exceptions: The plural of nouns ending in -ief, -ff, -oof, -rf, -eef, is formed by adding only -s to the word in the singular number:

SINGULAR | PLURAL
