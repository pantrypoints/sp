Principal verbs have no plural forms.

<!-- (1) For instance, I meditate, we meditate. He/she sang three songs, they sang three songs. -->

Auxiliary verbs, with the exception of the verbs be and have no plural forms.

SINGULAR | PLURAL
am (I am going.) | are (We are going.)
is (He is doing.) | are (They are doing.)

are (Thou art playing.)	| are (You are playing.)
has (Tom has a kite.) | have (Boys have kites.)

(1) In the third-person present indicative tense, principal verbs do have a singular form: they meditate, he/she meditates. –Eds.

In Bengali, transitive verbs are called sakarmak kriyá (সকর্মক ক্রিযা), and intransitive akarmak kriyá (অকর্মক ক্রিযা).
