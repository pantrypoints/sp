Some common medicinal plants include:
- bhrngaráj
- sushsni shák
- Asiatic pennywort (brahmi shák, thankuni, centella asiatica, L.)
- bahed́a (Terminalia chebula)
- Chinese chaste tree (nishinda, Vitex negundo, L.)
- ámŕa
- álmegh
- gándál
- mint (pudiná, rocanii)
- scholar’s leaves (chátim)
- cinkona (Cinchona calisaya)
- giima shák
- ashwagandha
- bottle gourd (láu)
- aloe (ghrta kumárii)
