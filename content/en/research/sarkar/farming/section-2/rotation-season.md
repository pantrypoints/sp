1/4 of the agricultural land is to be allotted for the following seeds:
- Wax gourd or squat gourd of different varieties
- Bottle gourd
- Lal kumŕá or diingla (varieties of pumpkins)
- Chal kumŕá and sachi kumŕá (pumpkins)
- Small bitter gourd and bitter gourd
- Thorny gourd
- Cucumber
- Water gourd

These are all-season vegetables, except thorny gourd which is a rainy season crop.

In a field of creeping vegetables, one may grow rainy season sesame along with the above vegetables in the rainy season. One may also grow winter sesame or mustard – either rái, red mustard or yellow mustard – and in the summer season one may grow summer sesame. This will not affect the productivity of creeping vegetables.

All-season vegetables should be grown as follows:


### Rainy: 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5

1. Wax gourd

The cuttings of wax gourd are to be planted between Aśádha and Mágha. Fruits are produced throughout the year. 

Between every 2 wax gourds there may be 1 okra of either the all-season or rainy season varieties, 1 all-season green chilli, and 1 radish of either the all-season or rainy season varieties. 
- Even in the rainy season wax gourd can do without a platform.

2. Gourd

Gourd of different varieties like round bottle gourd, club bottle gourd, long bottle gourd and ghoti láu are to be planted. 

Between every 2 gourd plants there should be an intermittent plant as in #1 above. 

Gourds of the rainy-season variety must be grown with a platform.


3. Pumpkin

Pumpkin may be either of the rainy season or all-season varieties. Between 2 pumpkin plants, there may be the intermittent crops mentioned in #1 above. 
- Pumpkins of the rainy season variety require a platform.

4. Miscellaneous varieties

Intermittent plants should be according to #1 above. 

Miscellaneous creepers of the rainy season variety require a platform.

Small portions of the land allotted for all-season varieties of crops should be reserved for the bona lanka variety of chilli or sown with other varieties of chilli. The seeds are to be acquired from Shantipur and Kalna.


### Winter: 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 1.5 

1. Wax gourd

The wax gourd should remain undisturbed. Intermittent plants should be the same as those for the rainy season, but no rainy season varieties should be planted. 

Varieties should be either all-season varieties or winter wax gourd. Vegetable creepers growing in the winter season do not require a platform.

2. Gourd

Gourd should be either of the all-season or winter varieties. Winter gourd sown in winter does not require a platform.

3. Pumpkin

Pumpkin should be of the all-season or winter varieties. The intermittent plants should also be of the all-season or winter varieties. Winter gourd does not require a platform.

4. Miscellaneous creepers

They should also be of the all-season or winter varieties. They may or may not grow on a platform.

Intermittent plants should be of the all-season or winter varieties.


### C. Summer: 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 

1. The wax gourd should not be disturbed. 

Intermittent crops such as okra, radish, and green chilli should be of the all-season or summer varieties.

2. Summer varieties of gourd do not require a platform. 

Intermittent crops should be of the all-season or summer varieties.

3. Summer pumpkin does not require a platform.

Even during the rainy season, wax gourd does not require a platform.
