At the beginning of this earth, there was absolute silence – there were no living beings or even plants. 

This continued for hundreds of millions of years, until the earth was properly formed. 

Then a phase came when rain and storms started, and by a gradual process, life emerged. 

Thanks to the rain, carbon atoms got infused with vital energy (práńa shakti). **Carbon atoms along with protoplasmic clash and cohesion formed this vital energy.**

Water was essential in the evolution of the planet. It is most essential for the survival of human beings, animals, plants and the planet as a whole. 

If it does not rain anywhere on earth for only one year, all life on the planet will be destroyed. 

This is because all creatures – from the smallest organisms to the largest animals – need water. 

If there is no water, first the small creatures will die, then the ecological balance of the planet will be lost. Next, human beings will also die, and soon the earth will become a barren wasteland.


## Global Water Crisis

In the near future there will be a severe crisis in many parts of the world. 

Many large rivers like the Ganga, the Jamuna and the Thames are already very polluted. 

People cannot drink this water. If they even wash their hands in it they can become infected. 

The only solution is to rely on rainwater. We must collect the rainwater, develop the science of making artificial rain through helium or any other process, and bring the clouds which rain over the ocean onto the land.

Constructing more deep tube wells is not the answer. 

Rather, we must catch the rainwater where it falls. Many ponds, canals, dams, lakes and reservoirs should be immediately constructed to catch the rainwater and store it for drinking water. This is the only way out of the water crisis that will confront humanity in the very near future.

In the physical sphere, there are 2 types of calamities:

1. Natural
2. Man-made 

Today, most calamities are caused by human beings. But sometimes, natural calamities like typhoons, floods, droughts, earthquakes, etc., also occur.

Although different types of calamities may confront humanity, doomsday will never happen. 
- **The very idea of doomsday is based on dogma.**

The calamities caused by human beings are mainly of 2 types.

1. The bifurcation and trifurcation of society

The bifurcation of society is exemplified by the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the recent war between North and South Vietnam. 

The division of India into India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh is an example of the trifurcation of society.

2. The destruction of the environment and the indiscriminate exploitation of subterranean resources such as coal, oil and water. 

One of the greatest causes of environmental destruction is deforestation. Due to deforestation, the rain clouds coming from the Bay of Bengal travel all the way across India and rain on the Arabian Sea. 
- The clouds which once rained on Magadh now rain on the Arabian Sea. 

Consequently, the water level in the Arabian Sea is gradually rising and the Bay of Bengal is becoming more salty. 

The result is that the water level around the coast of India is rising. The land area of the Indian subcontinent is decreasing and soil erosion is increasing. 

Approximately 2/3 of the surface of the globe is water. 1/3 is land. 

But due to deforestation, the water portion is increasing and the land portion is decreasing.

Another cause of environmental destruction is the exploitation of subterranean resources. 

Deep cavities have been formed in the earth after extracting subterranean resources. **These cavities should be properly filled**. 

In some countries, sand is used to fill the cavities created by mining underground coal. 

If these cavities are left unfilled:
- the surrounding regions are more likely to experience earthquakes than other areas. 
- the surface structure of the earth becomes severely weakened, causing whole regions to collapse.

In some Arab countries, huge amounts of money have been made by extracting oil from under the ground. 

Their leaders realized that the supply of oil would not last forever. So they started to think about the future of their countries after the supply of oil is exhausted. 

They became concerned that the level of the water-table was falling and the sizes of the deserts were increasing. 

To solve this problem, they decided to import soil and sweet water to create dense forests. 

Now the trees that they planted are 8-10 years old. Last year, it was reported that they experienced floods for the first time. 

<!-- Many of the local people had never seen floods before, and young children even cried in alarm at the sight of the rain! -->

The exploitation of subterranean water reserves is contributing to desertification in many parts of the world. 

As the subterranean water level recedes, the soil near the surface dries out and plants wither and die. This has already happened in many parts of Rajasthan. 

**Afforestation is the only solution to desertification.** 

<!-- Human beings have suffered from water scarcity and drought in the past. , and this problem will continue unless proper care is taken in the future. --> 

If deforestation and the indiscriminate exploitation of subterranean water reserves continue, many parts of the world will likely face severe water shortages from 1993 to at least the year 2000. 

The only way to avoid such a catastrophe is to immediately implement a decentralized approach to water conservation.
