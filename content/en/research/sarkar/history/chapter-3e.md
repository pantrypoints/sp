## Delhi, March 8, 1984

Baba came to Delhi again from Jammu and visited Deer-Park. Looking at the flora and fauna, He said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Pine in Sanskrit is known as Devadaru. 

Pine Indica, Indica being adjective of Indus in Latin, has its leave bending downwards, people wrongly call it Ashoka. 

The latter is Sarica Indica, its flowers are red. 

It is also said as Sita-Ashoka, since Sita, the wife of King Ram, sat beneath this tree, when she was kept in confinement by Ravana- the king of Lanka, according to the mythology of Ramayana. 

It is a plant of montania group, from which Ayurvedic medicines, Ashokarista and Ashokasava are made.

Deer are found everywhere in the world, even in frozen zone, where they are known as reindeer. 

Reindeer are used for carrying vehicles on ice, which have sledge and no wheel. 

In the icy region of Kashmir, Kasturi-deer are found. 

Deer are of 2 types:

1. Deer
2. Antelope

Antelopes are of cow-group, and are also known as Zebu or Zebu Indica.

There are 2 groups in cows:

1. junior

The junior group can give milk up to 3 kilos

2. senior.

The senior ones give more than 10 kilos. 

The varieties of cows change the more one goes towards the west of India- Shalu, Sirhindi, Bhaval varieties. 

Deer can also be 12 horned; ante- as Nila- lopes have tail like that of cows and so are also known gaya (Nila.cow). 

Krisnasara Mrga is also a variety of antelope.

Mrga, in Samskrta denotes all wild animals. 

Indian flora is fast getting destroyed. Previously, there were 7,010 varieties of orchids. Now only 4,000 varieties are available. 

Flora and fauna should be protected. 

**The history of flora and fauna is associated with the history of humans. Destruction of one will affect the other.** 

The earlier man understands this fact, the better it would be. 

Birds are fast extinguishing, white kites are no more available, which could be seen some 40-50 years ago. 

In India, white peacocks have been destroyed. Leopards which could be seen 40 years ago are rare today. 

The same is the case with python. 

The last eagle in England was killed about 40 years ago. 

**Man is the most dangerous carnivorous animal.** That's why the acceptance of Neo-humanism is most essential. 

The more one is intellectual, the more he is responsible for it. 

Humans should protect the helpless animals.

Deer also has 2 varieties:

1. junior
2. senior

The senior is taller than man. 

Humans have destroyed them. They kill the deer of senior variety on Sunday and eat it on Tuesday when its flesh becomes more tasty.

In Latin:
- carnis means flesh
- rorus means rural
- rostus means rustic. 

It is difficult to tame deer, white ass and white donkey. 

Krsnasara deer has black spots on the mouth and can be tamed after a few years of effort. 

Zebra, the white horse found in Tibet cannot be tamed. 

White ass found in the forests of Kuch (Gujrat) can be tamed in the second generation. 

Today, mostly asses are of ash colour. 

White peacocks are found in Burma.

In India it has been destroyed. 

The flesh of male peacock is sweet, while that of female is sour.

The bio-history of fauna is very interesting. 

Indian cow has 4 udders and give enough milk.

But the deer which has 2 udders can hardly give half a kilo of milk. 

The cow can not run fast while the antelope can. Proto-deer was the predecessor of of antelope and deer.

Later, antelope and cow became separate animals. 

Cows could be tamed and would provide enough milk, but it is difficult to tame antelope and it is quite insecure in forest. 

Cow-slaughter should be banned from a moral point of view. They serve man, its milk is good for brain.

Previously, in pre-partition period (before 1947), Sundarban constituted of 6 districts:

1. Midnapore
2. 24 Parganas
3. Khulna
4. Barisal
5. Noakhali
6. part of Howrah

It spanned 40,000 square miles. 

After partition 1.600 sq. miles remained in India and the rest in Bangladesh. 

Bangladesh destroyed its forests.
- The lion of that area swam over to Indian side. 

Forest pigs are strong enough to fight with lions.
- They even eat the cubs. 

Some 2 million years back, some of the pigs went into water.
- While adjusting with water, their feet became loose, their lungs became like that of water animals. 

Thus while adjusting with water, they were transformed into hydra-pig (dolphin), in Sanskrit called Shithumar or Bonsha in Hindi.

Australian powder-milk is from the milk of sheep after separating butter from milk. 

This butter oil has no food-value but is better than dalda. 

Peanut oil has some food value, it should be second choice. 

Palm oil is produced in Africa and Asia, from the seed of the ripened fruit.

African palm is growing in Baba's quarters af Lake Garden and Tiljala in Calcutta.

(Deer park was developed after evacuting a large number of poor people inhabiting in the villages, during the Emergency period of 1975-76)
