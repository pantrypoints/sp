On the cassion of Holi Festival, Baba said:

In winter, people do not get proper environment to work due to the shivering cold.

When spring season comes fresh leaves come in plants, people are in a mood of enjoyment.

That is why Holi festival is not so enthusiastically observed in coastal climates.

In Bengal, Holi is very little celebrated. 

When diffirent kinds of flowers bloom, people would enjoy the festival of Holi with flowers.

When enough flowers could not be available, it was celebrated with colours. On the full moon day after the winter.

When the Aryans came to India, they understood this secret.

In Bengal, Caitanya Mahaprabhu brought Dolyatra from Vrindavan. 

In Vrindavan, winter was quite severe. 

In Hindi, winter is called Ya'da' derived from 'Ja'da which means staticity.

Old people are very much affected by the cold of winter.

In folk song, in popular language, the winter says:

I do not touch children. The young are my brothers: do not leave the old, even though they use any amount of blanket to get themselves covered. 

Rural people cover themselves in winter with straw of paddy and sheep-skin. When winter was over, they would make a sheep of paddy straw, put an old woman's ngure made of straw over it and burn it. Next day they would celebrate the festival of Holi.

This is the proper survey of cultural history. 

Later myth was added to it.

Literature is of 4 kinds:

1. Kavya (verse)
2. Purana
3. Itikatha 
4. Hihasa

In Sanskrit it is said, Vakyam rasatmakam Kavyam -the lucid style of expression is Ka'vya

when it is not factual, but it is educational, then it is Purana, it is for the welfare of the people. 

The record of factuality is Itikatha. 

It is also said As Parakatha', Hivrita, Puravetta, There is no danger or harm from facts but history was destroyed when myth was added to it. 

But you must be conscious, must not deviate from the path af facts and factuality. There is no synonym for Itihas in English. I hasat Hyarthe Itihasah, the history which is educative, inspiring, glorifying and creates a circumstance to make the mind strong, is Hihasa. 

The history of Hada' Desh (Harauti area) will be an Inspiring episode.


<!-- 100 -->

Itihasa of India should be written in the following sp "Dharma'rthakama'moks'artham' Niitiva'kyaSamanvitam Fara vrttva katha'yuktam, Itihasa pracaks'ate."

Itihasa serves 4 dimensional purposes. 

1. To remove physical, mental and ecomomic pains
2. To give direction in physical world
3. To inspire to move towards the right path
4. To help in achieving salvation

Mahabharata is Itihasa and Ramayan is Purana. 

Abhijian Shakuntalam and Kumarsambhavam composed by Kalidas a Kavya or verse.


Kota. 18th March, 1984

Baba visited the garden known as Motiakundu. 

Baba said the Ganesh cult became prevalent 1,300 years ago when Puranicism was rising and Buddhism was waning.

Shaiva, Shakia Saura, Vaeshnava and Ganapatya cults came up during that period. 

Ganapatya cult had some influence in northern part but enough influence in south Rajasthan, Gujrat, Maharashis and Telangana portion of Andhra.

Ganesh is also known a Ganapati and Vinayaka, which means people's leader.

He is an Ideal who is to the adorned. He is not an ordinary person but a leader of people whose face is that of the biggest most powerful personality -- the elephant.

The wife of Ganesh is Tulsi or Sasthii. At places, Sasthii is the wife of Kartika. Devasena is also mentioned st wife of Kartika.

There was a temple of Ganesh which Baba visited and as above.

The priest said that the deity was known as Lamb dara. 

Baba further said:

Black chandan (sandal paste) is used for Surya (Sun godi Kali and Ganesh. The water level of this area is quite high There is no facility for digging out water, since the water level of Chambal is high, water flow is slow but it is subterranean. Hean be used for lift irrigation.


<!-- 101 -->

In old days, this area had heavy rainfall, ships would ply in River Chambal, some 3,000-4,000 years ago.

Due to natural causes and deforestation rains have become less. 

If afforestation is done properly, the problems of soil crosion, less rainfall and low water level will be solved within 15-20 years.

In regard to the temple Baba said:

The architecture of the temple is of Gauriya style. 

It has been built some 1200-1300 years ago. The priest belongs to the caste of the Gaur-Brahmaas.

Gaur-Brahmans came here from Bengal through land route, they maintained the system of knots of the ared thread, were proud of their inheritance and do not like marry in other castes or sections of Brahmans.

Nearby was a temple containing Shiva-Linga of black stone. 

Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
It is Somanath Linga. It has 4 faces. 
Wherever there is manath Linga, there must be crescent moon and Parvati. Han Liunga was made from the same stone by which the stone pet (kasauti) was made. Here the Shiva linga is made of the me stone. The idol of the place is more than 1300 years old. But the temple was reconstructed in the post-Muslim period. Han Linga has also an antiquity of 1500-2000 years.

Kotia Bhil ruled this area, 750 years ago, during Pathan period.

The historical name of Chambal is Charmanvati. It is 100 ft. deep. Irrigation facilities can be provided to Bundi by lift-irri- #ation. Even Sowai Madhopur can be irrigated. 

The first Aryan colonisation of this area started some 5,000 years ago.

Bhils were the indigenous population, they are Austrico-Scythians. 

When Aryans came Bhilla shifted southward to Mewar and Marwar. 

Anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, phonetics, intonation. and acoustics help in making out history of the people. Very few persons will be found with pressed nose amongst Nordics, Cauca- sians and Scythians. They use "at" in their acoustics.

<!-- 102 -->

The Austrico-Scythians have soil-like colour. Bhils are also like that with small height. Gaur Brahmans are fair in colour, so are Gaur-kayasthas, Yadavas and Rajputs, Jastika kshatriyas of Bharatpur and Alwar are smaller in height than those of Punjab, Hariyana and West U. P. The King of Bharatpur was also a 'Jath', Chambal has enough irrigation potentiality. Hada-desh has a bright future for horticulture and gardening.

Baba visited a sight known as Adharshila built in the memory. of Late Aulia (saint) Syed Maula All Shah. 

Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
When Imam (priest) of the place said that the Shah died 800 years ago, Baba said it is wrong since Muslims came to India 800 years ago, it can be 600 years ago when Shah would have died. Shah was a Shia saint. 
{{< /l >}}


The Shia sect emerged 950 years before. 

Sufism came up 100 later. 

Baba asked: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
In what style 'Hanin' or 'Vahavi' namas (prayer) is offered here? 
{{< /l >}}


The Imam had no idea of these styles of prayer. 

Sufism has adopted Hanif style of offering prayer. 

Maula Ali Shah was a great saint and belonged to Darvesh section. 

This is his Dargah (place of worship). 

Baba asked a question 'where is your mind concentrated while reciting "Amina" The priest of Dargah could not answer.
