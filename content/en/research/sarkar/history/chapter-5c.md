Medninagar, 1 April, 1984

Today Baba visited the fruit research centre at Chiyent While walking He made the following observations.

The soil in Magadha belongs to old Gondwanaland # laterite soil and contains plenty of calcium. It is ideal for ing roses, papayas, grapes, and white roses. Without using fertiliser, citrus, pumpkins, berries and guavas of medium this (guavas do not need much laterite soil) can readily grow in lastRE soil with only a little fertiliser. However laterite soil is ret for grafted mangoes.


Lemons can be grown well here but not oranges, which mostly in northeast India, including Assam.

Oranges are to peel than lemons, but oranges cannot be given to a dial patient while lemons can be. Custard apples, which were brought to India by the Portugese about 450 years ago, can also be grown in Magadha. Small and large-sized grapes with seeds can b grown in sixteen or more kilometers from the Ganga, en sides of the river.

Digha-variety of Langra' mango, which i small and sweet can also be grown here. The langra-mangha got five varieties which belong to Maldah, Bhagalpur, Luckn Monghyr and Digha. Roses are of two main varieties-occident and oriental. 

The former is a large rose but has little while the latter produces many strongly scented flowers in the winter. Liichis and bananas can be grown where the lit laterite. Composite fertiliser is the best nourishment for banana If plantation does not have proper irrigation, seeds grow in the fruit.


Afedininagar, April 2, 1963

Medaninagar is one of the famous towns of Magadha eivilisation, and is situated in Bihar, near, Ranchi. Magadha represents the river valley civilisation enriched by Phalgu, Niran- jana Sone, Kena and Ganga rivers.

In the ancient past, it was the seat of Buddhism and being Ron-vaedic, it was known as Magadha ]

Today Baba visited a Shiva temple at Rajawadiha near Medininagar. 

The deity of the temple is Siddheshvara Shiva, and the Mehanta or priest of the temple belongs to the Dasnami section. of Shankaracarya sect. The Mahamandaleshvar of the sect lives in Varanasi. There is a perennial flow of water near the deity. Baba explained that the water level of Rajawadiha is high, providing a a continuous flow for a fountain near the deity. According to the priest the deity is known as Narvadeshvara Joytirlinga How- ever, Dhyana mantra of Shiva is used during worship at the temple. The original Shiva-linga was stolen and a new one brought from Jaipur and established here.


Magadhi Prakrta became extinct 2,000 years ago. But eastern or oriental demi-Magadhi and western or occidental demi-Magadhi emerged as its two offshoots. 

About 1,200 years ago, Assamia, Bengali, Oriya, Angika and Maethili developed from the oriental branch and Magahii, Bhojpuri, Nagpuria and Chattisgarhi evolved from the occidental one. 

In the oriental offshoots 'cha' is used for the present tense and 'la and 'ba' for the past and future tenses; in the occidental off- shoots 'cha' is not used for the present tense but 'la' and 'ba' are still used for the past and the future tenses.

Tatanagar, 4 April, 1984

[ Tatanagar is the industrial town of Bihar, but more singni- cant is the fact that it is a place around which the civilisation of Rárh flourished. Rarh is a rich valley civilisation comprising of five-valley-civilisations. Herein one can visualize the advent and blending of Shacvism, Jainism, Buddhism, Pauranicism and Gauriya Vaeshnavism. It is a rich and glorious land of deve- loped civilisaction which is the vicinity of Tatanagar, previously known as Ka'limati.

Rarh dipicts the presence of Bone Age and also where farm- ing or sowing of seeds was invented, before which humans were hunters and food-gatherers. 

Nature and humans had made this civilisation of Rach a glorious panorama of human history]
Baba came to Tatanagar from Medininagar. 

During His stay at Tatanagar, Bab visited a place called Jayada on the banks of the Suvarnarcha river, about 32 kilometers from Tata. 

He went to a Shiva temple which had a large Shiva linga as its deity. Baba made some inquiries among the local villagers and was told that people with the title 'Garain', Barak, Das and Majhi live here. They are vegetarians, wear a Kanthi, a garland, made of round pieces of tulsi-wood around the neck. 

People with the title of Kurmi-Mahato also live here. The title of the priest is Pandey. Baba observed, Gauriya and Utkat Brahmans do not act as Purohits in social and religious functions. 

The script found here was rectangular in shape. 

Two famous kings of the Varahabhum Rajya were Adivaraha, and Keshavaraha. 

To the west of this kingdom was Ranchi, to the east Manbhum. The entire area within this boundary was known as Varahabhum and its capital was Varahbajar. Purulia, Chandil, Muri, Deogarh, Patamda, Arsa and Nimdi were included in Varahabhum rajya.

The original population of Bengal consisted of people with titles like Mahato, Kurmi-mahato, Mahiaya, Sadgope, Rajvanshi and Chakma. The titles Garain which was derived from Garh- Kiirti, was also prevalent in the original population. The Gara- ins adopted Jainism as their religion. Other tribes like the Kheria-Munda, Singh munda, Khangar munda, Cussia munda, Kusmete munda also existed in Bengal. The fathers of poeple with these titles were Bengalis while the mothers belong to the Munda community

Folhas form the majority of the Muslims in Rarh; but tarains, who came from Garha-kir'ti, are also treated as low caste people. 

Water touched by them is not used by higher castes. Garh means place of famous learning, while Garhakiirti means a person who looked after Garh. 

After the decay of Jainism, Hindus began to look down on Garains. Julahas who had previously been Buddhist or Jains also met the same fate. The socio-religious dogma and discrimination caused by such caste sentiments has a divis sive impact on Indian society.

The influence of Maha'prabhu was very great in Tripura: A clan from Burma came to Tripura a little before Pathan rule commenced. 

The Pathan king Mu-chang-fa embraced Vaeshnavism, and became known as Viir Bikram Bhahadur Under Maha'prabhu's influence, the Digamvar Jains of Rarh alsa embraced Gauriiya Vaeshnavism. Although Jain influence was dominant in Midnapore after Maha'prabhu visitd the region the entire area came under the inflence of Vaeshnavism.
