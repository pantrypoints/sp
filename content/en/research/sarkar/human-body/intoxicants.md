The greatest wealth of a human being is his or her intellect. 

One should not drink because drinking destroys the intellect. 

In the natural state, one thinks many thoughts in the unconscious mind where knowledge is stored. 

One thinks in the unconscious mind and controls one's actions through the conscious mind.

Suppose there is a beggar in Nagpur city. He imagines that he is the Emperor of Delhi. But since his conscious mind says, “No, you are not the emperor of Delhi, you are the beggar of Nagpur,” he does not say it openly. 

But if he drinks wine, his conscious mind stops functioning. Due to lack of control over his conscious mind, walking along the road he will say aloud, “I am the Emperor of Delhi.”


**Intellect controls every action of a person, but drinking destroys it. That is why wine is a bad thing.**

According to medical science, alcohol is a poison.  

Before receiving a vaccination of some kind, a cotton swab saturated with alcohol is swabbed across the injection site to dissolve the cell walls of the bacteria and viruses living on the skin and kill them instantly.
 
The same happens thing when we drink anything containing alcohol. 

Our body sees alcohol as a poison. To fight back, we produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase.  

This enzyme tries to counteract the ingested alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and then on to the liver. 

In its effort to complete the "clean-up process," healthy liver tissue is sacrificed and dissolved, forming scar tissue. When it collects, it creates cirrhosis of the liver.

People practice meditation to make their intellect and intuition sharper and to achieve greater expansion. 

The use of liquor destroys these faculties. Alcohol destroys the glands, sub-glands, nerves, and nerve cells in the human body. 

If one consumes alcohol, it is partly ejected from the body through perspiration, partly through defecation, and partly through urination.  

This is why the perspiration, feces, and urine of those who are intoxicated by liquor smell very bad.
