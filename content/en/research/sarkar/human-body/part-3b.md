By performing asanas regularly, humans can control:
- the propensities attached to each cakra
- consequently, the thoughts which arise in their minds and their behaviour

This is because asanas have a profound effect on the glands and sub-glands by either pressurizing or depressurizing them.

For example, mayurasana [peacock posture] has a pressurizing effect on the manipura cakra. 

The secretions of the glands and sub-glands of the manipura cakra and the propensities associated with them will become more balanced if this asana is practised regularly.

**If someone has a great fear of public speaking, it means his or her manipura cakra is weak**.*

Through the regular practice of mayúrásana, this propensity will be controlled and fear will be eliminated.

Other ásanas may have a depressurizing effect on the mańipura cakra. If these ásanas are performed regularly, the glands and sub-glands associated with the cakra will become less active.

Increased glandular secretions generally make the propensities more active and vice versa.

By practising asanas regularly, one can control the propensities and either increase or decrease their activity. 

**So spiritual aspirants should select the ásanas they perform very carefully.** 

<!-- This effect of asanas on glands and sub-glands has never been revealed before. -->


Extreme fear causes excessive tension and pressure on the manipura cakra.

Normally when people experience fear, the afferent and efferent nerves are able to work properly. 

The tension in the nerves caused by the fear travels through the nervous system and reaches the brain, so excessive pressure does not occur.

However, when a person becomes extremely afraid the balance between the afferent and efferent nerves is lost. Then there is a build-up of tension and pressure around the manipura cakra.

If the information carried by the efferent nerves from the brain to the mańipura cakra is prevented from reaching its destination, the imbalance can cause a blockage in the region of the anáhata cakra which is a very complicated and sensitive part of the human body.

A disturbance in this region can cause:
- palpitations
- excessive pressure on the heart
- the inability to act decisively
- a heart attack.


## Lymph Glands

In human beings the thyroid and parathyroid glands are more developed than the lymphatic glands. 

Previously the lymphatic glands were more developed than they are today.

But as human beings evolved, the thyroid and parathyroid glands became more active and the role of the lymphatic glands diminished.

In monkeys, the opposite is the case: the lymphatic glands are more developed than the thyroid and parathyroid glands.
- The thyroid and parathyroid glands are concerned with psychic development and intellectual elevation
- The lymphatic glands are more concerned with physical activity

This is why monkeys can jump higher and swing further than human beings.

One of the reasons why human beings are more evolved than monkeys is that their thyroid and parathyroid glands are more active.

Semen and lymph are not the same thing.

When males are sexually aroused, the nerves in the testes get stimulated and lymph is converted into semen.

Joint hair grows near the lymphatic glands in the armpits and leg joints.

If this hair is removed, then the lymphatic glands tend to overheat, causing over-secretion.

This in turn decreases the function of the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

**There is an inverse relation between the lymphatic glands and the thyroid and parathyroid glands.**

If one is more active then the other is less developed and it becomes weak.

This is why the joint hair should not be removed.

The process of controlling all the chakras and propensities was invented by Astavakra over 2,000 years ago.
- He wrote the book Aśt́ávakra Saḿhitá. 
- He was a great saint and called this process Rájadhirája Yoga.
- He first taught this system of yoga to Alarka at Vakreswar in Bengal.


The human body is a biological machine.

<!-- No body deviates from this rule – -->

All physical bodies are biological machines.*

The different types of lessons in Ananda Marga sádhaná [spiritual practices] are designed to strengthen the different cakras and control the propensities. 

Guru dhyana [meditation on the guru] strengthens the sahasrara cakra. 
- If there is control over the sahasrara cakra, then the body and mind can be controlled completely.

When a great man gives you a blessing, he generally does it by placing his hand on the sahasrara cakra.
- This has a positive effect on all the other cakras.
- The higher propensities will be increased and the lower propensities will be decreased. 

This kind of effect is not only produced by touch.
- **It can also be caused by sound.** 

When you do sastauṋga pranama [prostration] to a great personality and are verbally blessed as well, the sound of the blessing will have a positive effect on your whole being.

Both the touch of the hand on the sahasrara cakra and the **verbal blessing** will increase your spiritual elevation.

**You can only bless those you like.** 

**If you accept salutations from those you dislike, negative sentiments may arise in your mind.**
- This would increase the lower propensities and decreasing the higher propensities in those seeking your blessing.

So you do not have the right to accept salutations from all people. **You should not automatically bless everyone.**

The cranium of females is usually slightly smaller than that of males. 

Consequently, women have less nerve cells in the brain than men.

But the fact is that men use a very small number of the nerve cells in their brains, and the same applies to women. 

Spiritual practices and higher pursuits utilize more and more nerve cells. 

Suppose a man and a woman learn sádhaná at the same time, practise with the same sincerity and progress with the same speed. They will both achieve spiritual elevation.

Suppose they both enjoy divine bliss after performing sádhaná for the same number of years.

If all or 99% of the nerve cells in the woman's brain are utilized, a lower percentage will be utilized by the man because he has more nerve cells in his brain.

Women have some propensities which are very strongly developed.
- They normally have great love and affection for their children. 
- But if the expression of a particular propensity is excessive, it may have adverse consequences. 

For instance, most stepmothers love their own children more strongly than their stepchildren.

If the intensity of this affection is not controlled, it may create tensions and divisions in the family. 

Also, because of the affection women have for their children, they may not like to go outside the home, and if this is taken to extremes, it may lead to harmful isolation.

Similarly, if many people living in a particular region only stay in their own region out of blind love for their locality, it will be detrimental to the progress of society as a whole. 
- Good relations with other regions would not be encouraged.
- The trade and economic development of their region may be adversely affected.

Love and affection are very good attributes.

But to protect oneself and society from their possible extreme expressions, the best path to follow is to channelize all one’s love and affection towards Parama Puruśa [Supreme Consciousness].

This will expand the arena of one’s love and accelerate one’s march towards the Great. A person who has developed universal love will be able to do very great work in a very short time.
