## The Principle of Consciousness and the Principle of Activity

Crudification or Saiṋcara is the centrifugal activity of the Nucleus (Puruśottama) of the Macrocosm. 

This Nucleus is:
- the center, witness, or subject of the Macrocosm which is Its periphery, experience, or object.
- **The Principle of Consciousness** [Puruśa]

<!-- Pure -->
 <!-- or the makes the Hence this Macrocosmic Nucleus or  is --> <!-- which witnesses  counterpart of the objective Macrocosm. --> 

<!-- Puruśa or Citishakti (power of mind) is  -->
{{< i s="/graphics/physics/centrifugal.jpg" a="Centrifugal" >}}

 
**The Principle of Activity** [Prakrti] is the **inherent** tendency of the transcendental <!-- Puruśa -->Principle of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness. 
- Hence, the activation of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness without the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> <!-- the presence of a second principle --> is impossible. 
- Action results only when the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> gets a chance to express itself. <!-- scope of expression. -->

The 2 <!-- factors --> forces are thus:

1. Consciousness (Puruśa)
2. Activity (Prakrti)*

{{< n n="In Superphysics, we call this Existence-Consciousness" >}}

These are dual in theory but singular in spirit. 
- Their collective body is just like that of fire: we cannot think of fire without its heat. 
- In the same way, one cannot think of Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> without Activity <!-- Prakrti --> in the collective body of Existence (Brahma).

Activity <!-- Prakrti --> may thus be defined as an attribute of Consciousness.
- Activity is feminine
- Consciousness is masculine. <!--  Puruśa. --> 

Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> remains objectless <!-- or nirguńa --> when it has no Activity. <!-- We say that it ithere is no expressed activity of Prakrti, that is, where activity is dormant.  -->

This <!-- Prakrti --> Activity is also a collective flow of 3 immanent principles:

1. Sentient<!-- or sattva -->: This creates the identity or ego or pure “I” feeling
2. Mutative <!-- or rajah -->: This transforms identity into an active identity as the Doer “I” or active ego
3. Static <!-- or tamah -->: This causes the <!-- mutative --> ego to <!-- imbibe the results of actions of the Doer “I”, that is, by --> create the ego-effect <!-- done “I” out --> from the action of the <!-- of the Doer “I” as the results of the latter --> active ego*

{{< n n="This is the 'me' of Descartes" >}}


<!-- . Prakrti is the collective name of these three principles. -->

In Objectless Existence (Nirguńa Brahma), Activity <!-- of Prakrti --> is dormant. 
- She cannot manifest Herself, though the eternal flow exists. 

Thus, the flow of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> means the flow of 3 belligerent forces. 

Mathematically speaking, this fight results in a triangle of forces.
- Consciousness <!-- Puruśa or Shiva --> at this stage gets encircled by Activity <!-- Shivánii (here Prakrti is called Shivánii) --> as a triangle of forces.


## Crudification (Saiṋcara)

The internal clash and cohesion, division and association of these 3 immanent principles causes creation to come out from a point in any one of the vertices of the triangle of Active forces. 
- The Macrocosmic Nucleus is the center of the triangle. 
- The Vertex (Shambhú) is the point in Consciousness where creation comes out.

<!--  is the Puruśa or consciousness at the vertex . The central point of the triangle is the  -->

The Macrocosmic Nucleus is:
- the subjectivated Consciousness <!-- Shiva --> and 
- the center of all the creative principles.

The movement which starts from this Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> <!-- as the centre --> is <!-- an exterial --> divisive or centrifugal. It changes from subtle to crude and is called The Crudification Cycle<!--  Saiṋcara -->. <!--  is the name given to this particular movement in the spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga. --> It comes out from the Vertex <!-- Shambhú --> as a never-ending process.

The vertices of the triangle of forces are points having certain positions, but no absolute movement. **It is a stage of stagnancy and hence dominated by the static principle.** 

The static force is a crudifying factor. 

The mutative force overcomes the static force. It causes a stir of expression on the static seed. This expression is logically and scientifically is:
- unfathomable <!-- in gravity -->
- sentient in tendency
