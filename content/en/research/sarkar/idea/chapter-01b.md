## The Cosmic Identity as Identity-Layer from Sentient Principle of Activity 
<!-- Prakrti -->

Thus, Activity <!-- Prakrti --> expresses Herself as the resultant force that starts crudification<!--  saiṋcara -->*. 
- This Activity <!-- Prakrti --> is sentient, though rudimentally static. 
- It creates the Pure “I” feeling in Consciousness<!--  Puruśa -->. 


{{< n n="Crudification<!--  Saincara --> is the start of the feelings" >}}


It is a pure “I” feeling because sentient Activity <!-- Prakrti --> cannot go any further. 

This stage is known as the Identity-Layer (Mahattattva). 
- It is nothing but the Cosmic “I”
- This is the first bondage of Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> by His innate sentient Activity<!-- Prakrti -->.

```elixir
Cosmic Identity [The One] = Pure Consciousness + Sentient Principle of Activity
```

**This bondage is located in a microscopic fraction of His universal body**. 
- But it is not felt as a bondage because of its looseness
- Hence it is merely theoretical

The Consciousness in the Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva --> undergoes only the slightest metamorphosis. 


## Active 'I' as Ego-Layer from the Mutative Principle of Activity
<!-- Prakrti -->

As crudification goes on<!-- the movement of saiṋcara proceeds further -->, sentient Activity <!-- Prakrti --> is gradually transformed into mutative Activity <!-- principle --> due to internal clash. 
- **This mutation causes the feeling of a second subject.** 
- This transforms the Cosmic “I” into the Cosmic Doer or Active “I” under the influence of <!-- Prakrti's --> mutative Activity<!--  principle -->. 

```elixir
Cosmic Doer [The Active One] = Cosmic Identity + Mutative Activity
```

This Cosmic Active “I” is known as the Ego-Layer (Ahaḿtattva).
- Here, the bondage created by Activity <!-- Prakrti --> on Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> is more prominent than that in the Identity-Layer<!--  Mahattattva -->
- But it still is subjective (second subjective) in character because Consciousness still has no objects
- This bondage felt by the Ego-Layer is therefore also theoretical.

<!-- Ahaḿtattva,  -->From a psychological point of view, the Ego-Layer is the activated counterpart of the subjective “I” <!-- with the subjectivation being done --> caused by mutative Activity<!--  Prakrti -->. 

The metamorphosis of Consciousness in the Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> is still highly subtle because there are no objects yet. <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> Thus, the Ego-Layer exists only in subjective strata.
