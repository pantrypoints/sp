## Objects as Mind-Stuff from the Static Principle of Activity

As static Activity starts its domination, it forces the Ego-Layer or Active Identity <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> to separate from the Identity-Layer or Cosmic Identity to become the object of the Cosmic Identity. 

This allows the Ego-Layer to have full activity through the cruder mind-stuff (citta). <!-- gets objectivated. --> 

<!-- This cruder stage in the process of saiṋcara is known as .  -->

<!-- Objectivation takes place because  -->

<!-- The static Prakrti forces the Ego-Layer to assume the form that allows cause and effect.  -->
<!-- of the result of the final activation.  -->

Thus, the Cosmic Subjective “I” or Cosmic Identity is partially transformed by the Principle of Activity into:
- the Cosmic Active “I” [Acting Identity or cause]
- the Cosmic objective “I” from a portion of its Cosmic Subjective “I” [target or effect]. 

Here, Consciousness becomes Its own objects, as mind-stuff. <!-- undergoes an objective change, --> Thus, the mind-stuff <!-- Cosmic objective “I” --> is an objectivated form [target or effect] of the Cosmic Identity.  <!-- subjectivated “I” --><!-- , and also of Supreme Consciousness -->

<!-- It is not only that the Cosmic Doer “I”  -->

Through the Cosmic mind-stuff created from the Cosmic Identity:
- mutative Activity <!-- Prakrti --> lets the Active Identity do psychic functions 
- static Activity<!--  Prakrti --> makes a portion of the Active Identity <!-- Doer “I” or Ahaḿtattva --> **feel** <!-- has imbibed --> the results of Its own actions (gets objectivated) 

Here, Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> feels the bondage as an objective reality or Cosmic mind-stuff. <!-- The Cosmic  mind-stuff is this Active Puruśabháva coming under the influence of static Prakrti.  -->
<!-- This citta is an objective reality. -->
- Its *immediate* mental subjectivity is the Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> 
- Its *supreme* mental subjectivity is the Identity-Layer<!--  Mahattattva -->. 

**"Mind" is the collective name of the Identity-Layer, Ego-Layer, and mind-stuff**<!-- Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva and citta -->. 
- Its subjective counterpart or cause is the Cosmic Consciousness<!-- Puruśa Cosmic Puruśa -->.

```elixir
Mind = Cosmic Identity + Active Identity + Mindstuff
```

The process of crudification <!-- saiṋcara --> still continues under the increasing domination of static Activity<!--  Prakrti -->.
- The Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> transforms into the Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva -->
- The Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva --> transforms into the Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva -->
- The Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> transforms into mind-stuff <!-- citta -->

<!-- owing to the influence of one or the other aspect of Prakrti.  -->

**Mind-stuff under the influence of static Activity gets cruder and is eventually transformed into the ether<!-- ethereal entity -->.** 

The pressure and domination of static Activity <!-- Prakrti --> continue increasingly. This external pressure:
- decreases the <!-- makes , and as a result of this increasing -->  the external space within that structural scope<!-- goes on decreasing gradually -->. 
- simultaneously increases the chemical affinity. 

The gradual crudification results in the other layers:
- aerial
- luminous
- liquid
- solid


```elixir
Mindstuff = Aether + Aerial + Luminous + Liquid + Solid
```

The solid factor is:
- the crudest manifestation of the Cosmic <!-- citta --> mind-stuff
- where the pressure of static Activity<!--  Prakrti --> on the Cosmic mindstuff <!-- citta --> reaches the zenith of its capacity.

<!-- "Bala" is  -->


## Energy (Prana) is the External Pressure (Bala) from Static Principle of Activity

The external pressure of static <!-- Prakrti --> Activity on those 5 layers manifests as "Energy" (práńa). This energy is made up of 2 opposing forces:

1. A divisive force (centrifugal)

This tries to split up the object into thousands*

{{< n n="*This leads to entropy in Physics. This manifests as a quasar in the physical domain" >}}


2. A unifying force (centripetal)

This is the centre-seeking or interial force that tries to maintain the object's structural solidarity*

{{< n n="*This manifests as a galaxy in the physical domain" >}}


```elixir
Energy = (Divisive Static Pressure from Activity + Unifying Static Pressure from Activity) 5 Layers
```


<!-- The collective name of these exterial and interial forces is  or .  -->

Every solid factor has energy which is the eternal game between the Cosmic cause and its crudest effect.

<!-- In práńa there exists an internal clash in which  -->

Either of the 2 active forces may win.*
- if the <!-- interial --> unifying <!-- centripetal --> forces win, then a nucleus is formed within the solid factor. This leads to a solid structure. The maintenance of its physical solidarity then depends on the external pressure from static Activity<!-- bala or --> <!-- external-static-pressure -->.
<!-- that is, if the resultant force created happens to be interial in character, -->
- if the <!-- exterial --> divisive <!-- centrifugal --> forces win, no nucleus is formed

#### Superphysics Note:

The Supreme Negativity crudifies the Absolute Entity into the Supreme Entity. In the process, this splits the Supreme Negativity into a:
- Negative-negative: This divides
- Positive-negative: This unifies  

{{< /b >}}


<!-- the resultant exterial cannot form any nucleus within that physical structure. The resultant interial force is, therefore, the only factor that can create a nucleus within a solid body and thereby maintain its structural solidarity.  -->

Even if the unit's structural solidarity is maintained, there can be spaces within the unit structure where the <!-- exterial --> divisive forces predominate over the reacting unifying forces. <!-- interials --> 

In such a space, dissociation occurs.
- The spaces under the influence of a creative divisive <!-- resultant exterial --> force gets detached from the parent body. 
- **This manifests as the wear and tear in the unit structure.**


The physical deficiency caused by this wear and tear is compensated by the energy <!-- práńa --> that we get from food, light, air, water, etc.

<!-- {n n="This means that the longevity of objects (anti-entrophy) is maintained by the unifying force -->

**The solidarity of our composite structure remains unchanged in spite of this wear and tear as long as the nucleus remains under the influence of the <!-- resultant interial --> creative unifying force.**
