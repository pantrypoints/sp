In Sanskrit, this vital energy is always plural because it is a collection of 10 important forces (váyus) with 5 working internally, and 5 working externally of the physical structure.


Internal Vayu | Jurisdiction | Function 
--- | --- | --- 
Práńa | navel point to the vocal cord | inhalation and exhalation
Apána | <!-- páyu --> anus to the navel point | controls the movement of urine and stool
Samána | navel | maintains adjustment between práńa and apána
Udána | throat | controls the vocal cord and the voice
Vyána | | regulates blood circulation and the afferent and efferent nerves


## Death

A physical deficiency or defect in any portion of the body results in the weakening of práńa and apána.
- Samána may become unable to maintain adjustment between práńa and apána
- This causes a vehement fight in:
  - in the navel area and
  - in the vocal cord. 

In physiology, this is called “navel breathing” (nábhishvása). 

**When samána loses its vitality, all the 3 váyus – práńa, apána and samána – are transformed into one and strike udána.** 

When udána loses its separate identity, vyána also comes in contact with their collective force.
- All the internal váyus <!-- associated into --> becomes one

These move throughout the physical body with great force and strike at every delicate point for an outlet. 
- The combined váyus pass out of the physical structure
- They take with them <!-- , and with their passing away from the physical structure --> all the external váyus, except dhanaiṋjaya.


External Vayu | Jurisdiction | Function 
--- | --- | --- 
Nága (serpent) | | allows jumping, extending the body, throwing an object
Kúrma (tortoise) | | allows contraction
Krkara | | yawning
Devadatta | | responsible for thirst and hunger
Dhanaiṋjaya | | causes sleep and drowsiness (tandrá)


Dhanaiṋjaya causes sleep. 
- And so to cause the deep sleep of death, dhanaiṋjaya remains in the body even after all the váyus have left.

When the dead body is burnt or gets totally decayed, dhanaiṋjaya leaves the body and remains in the Cosmos to act again according to the will of the Principle of Activity.

**The loss in the parallelism of physical and mental waves causes death.**
- The physical cause of death is the passing away of the 9 vayus (10 minus dhanaiṋjaya) into eternal space. 
- The psychic waves, finding no proper adjustment with the physical waves, also dissociate and pass into eternal space. 


The universal law of of Activity mandates that <!--  (which it had to express according to the  Prakrti that --> every force must have its expression. 

The detached mental body possesses the unexpressed momentum of its previous lives.

**It is the duty of the Cosmic mutative force to provide it a proper physical parallelism for due expression by making the dissociated mind penetrate into a subtle physical structure.** 

This dissociated mind's unit consciousness or atman still witnesses this state of inaction

<!--  has, therefore, the witnessing entity who witnesses the mind which is in a state of inaction (or converted into karmáshaya – saḿskára, or reaction in its potentiality).
 
Since the mind exists, the mental plate exists, and the reflection of Puruśottama must remain. 
The Átman, therefore, remains associated with the jiivátman. 
The ultimate knowership, doership and base of existence lie in the átman. 
The átman is the witnessing entity without which there is no meaning of the mind working or activating the internal saḿskáras into tanmátras. 
Without the átman, the mind cannot perceive or receive the incoming quantum-perceptionstanmátras . This is why the ultimate knowership or doership lies in the átman. 
The átman witnesses the mind itself. The ultimate residence of the mind is the átman. --> 
<!-- The physical cause of death has been discussed above. Let us now see the physical cause of life. -->


## Structural Dissociation [Supernova] from the Lack of Vital Energy

Structural Dissociation (jadasphota) happens when celestial bodies lose vital energy. This can be:
- instantaneous, or
- gradual

Instantaneous structural dissociation happens when static Activity <!-- Prakrti --> continues exerting static pressure<!--  or bala --> on a lifeless unit structure. 
- This compresses the solid body until it creates a tremendous reaction within the physical body affecting both the unifying and divisive forces. 
- In Physics, this is called a supernova.

<!-- Unable to express life, the  becomes more compressed. Eventually, this creates --> <!-- Consequently, a stage will come when there will be little interatomic space within . If static Prakrti exerts more pressure, there will be -->  <!-- interial and the exterial --> <!-- forces. This leads to an instantaneous structural dissociation (jad́asphot́a). -->  <!-- "" -->.

In a living celestial body, the existing congenial environment will convert energy into vital energy. <!--  cause transformation of práńa into práńáh. --> 
- This eliminates the chance of dissociation.


Gradual structural dissociation happens when a living celestial body has divisive energy <!-- práńa --> permeating some of its spaces. 


<!-- dissociation occurs gradually in some spaces of the structure, then the bursting up becomes gradual. -->

Both instantaneous and gradual dissociation converts the celestial body back into the component 5 fundamental layers.
<!-- Due to jad́asphot́a, gradual or , the component factors of the physical structure get dissociated into the  factors.  -->


## Reverse-Crudification (Negative Saincara)

Reverse-Crudification <!-- Negative saiṋcara --> is the retracing back in Crudification<!-- saiṋcara -->. 

In this process, the component layers <!-- factors --> cannot dissociate subtler than the ethereal, as that would mean the Ego-Layer withdrawing its active thought-projection. 
- This withdrawal would mean suspension of the Cosmic Mind or the cessation of Macrocosmic activity or the end of creation.<!-- , as creation itself is only a thought-projection of the Macrocosm.  -->

Dissociation is not an end of thought.
- It is a <!-- Bursting up is not a phenomenon of withdrawal, but a --> stirring up of the thought-waves due to excessive pressure of static Activity<!-- Prakrti -->.

The dissociation creates new identities as the 5 fundamental factors.

In this way, the journey of evolution continues eternally according to the divine urge of the Macrocosm. There is no chance of the thermal death of the universe.
