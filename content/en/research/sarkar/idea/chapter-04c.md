Mind is a state in the process of Brahma Cakra.
- It is the result of changing positions
- It is essentially a stage in the process of motion. 

This implies a momentum which mind has to express.
- To find expression, the mind adopts certain inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupations. 
- These occupations (love, hatred, fear, etc.) are known as propensities (vrtti). 

**A propensity is “the way of expression of mind”.**
- On the psychic level this <!-- occupation --> is called “expressed sentiment” or feelings.
- The feelings <!-- Sentiments --> affecting subsidiary glands are known as “instincts”. 

“Subsidiary gland” means any gland other than the pineal and the pituitary.*

{{< n n="*Therefore the main glands are the pineal (sahasrara chakra) and pituitary (ajna)" >}}


Some psychologists define “instinct” as “accumulated sentiment”. They imply that instincts are:
- later stages of sentiments
<!-- , that is, that instincts are  -->
- created when sentiments get themselves habituated

This is a theoretical definition.

A spiritual aspirant, who is a practical psychologist, realizes that **instinct is a feeling affecting the subsidiary glands** [not pineal nor pituitary].
- These subsidiary glands are the sub-stations of organs whose main controlling station is in the brain. 

The mind is:
- "saḿkalpátmaka" when its internal feelings <!-- occupations --> lead towards the Great.
- "vikalpátmaka" when its feelings lead towards the mundane or crude

The help of the organs are needed for:
- the evolution of the saḿkalpátmaka and vikalpátmaka mind 
- the creation of external waves

This help is also essential for crude manifestation in the physical stratum and other multifarious activities.
- The subtle brain does not work directly. 
- It requires cruder sub-stations under its control.


## Expression, Samskara, Propensity, Nerves, and Blood

Waves have to be developed for other manifestation of the internal samskaras.
- **These waves have to be created in the nerves and in the blood.**
 <!-- reactive-momenta  -->
 <!-- saḿskáras -->. 

The sub-stations of the mind go on transmitting the waves depending on:
- the sanguinary flow and 
- the strength of the nerves

**The seed of every propensity is in the brain.** 
- **But the first expression occurs in the sub-station of the mind, as the glands of the body**. 


**The glands or sub-stations of the mind create the waves.**
- These waves are then expressed outwardly through efferent nerves. 
- The motor organs work with the help of efferent nerves.
- **But the secret of the working lies with these mental sub-stations or glands.**


**The number of propensities varies according to the complexity of the physical structure.** 
- The more complex the structure, the greater the number of propensities. 
- More-developed animals, therefore, have more propensities than less-developed ones. 

Generally, there are 1,000 propensities in the human structure. 
- In their development and expression on the ordinary crude level, they are 50 in number. 
- **This means that the 1,000 seeds of those propensities are present in the brain in the pineal gland.**
- This is why the yogis called it the sahasrára cakra (sahasra means “thousand”)
<!-- The collective number being one thousand, the seeds of all those thousand vrttis -->

<!-- Because of the existence of these seeds of one thousand vrttis , the .  -->

- The subsidiary glands control 48 propensities. 
- The pituitary gland controls 2:
  - Saḿkalpátmaka, or one leading to parávidyá (knowledge of the Great)
  - Vikalpátmaka, relating to aparávidyá (knowledge of the mundane). 

<!-- vrttis --> <!--  indriyas -->
**The pineal as a structure controls all these 50* propensities taken internally and externally by all 10 sense-organs.** 50 propensities x 2 internal-external x 10 sense-orgrans = 1,000.

Within the scope of these propensities lies the seed of saḿskára.

 <!-- good or bad reactive momenta. -->

- Yogis who can control<!--  over --> the sahasrára cakra can attain nirvikalpa samádhi -- a state where they are beyond the approach of all the propensities<!-- vrttis -->. 
  - The attainment of such a state means the end of all reactive momenta (samskara)
  - The exhaustion of all the previous momentum accumulated by the mind due to its previous journeys in Brahma Cakra is called mokśa, the union with the Transcendentality.


{{< n n="We implement the 50 propensities as the lines (travel, marriage, venus, etc). <!-- 7 + 3 dimensions multiplied by 5 layers. --> The 2 is the change from past to present. The 10 is the dominant 7 mounts and 3 lines. " >}}
