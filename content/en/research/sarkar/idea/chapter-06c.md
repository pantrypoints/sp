The Cycle of Existence or Brahma Cakra is tthe collective name of crudification and subtilification.
- It has no uniformity of flow.
  - the sentient force is faster than the mutative
  - the mutative force is faster than the static. 

Thus, in the beginning of crudification speed is attained. <!-- saiṋcara the speed is greater.  -->

Similarly, after elevation, the influence of the sentient force causes the unit mind to reach  sámánya deha (a stage beyond the hirańmaya kośa where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is faster. 

The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos.
- It gets accelerated if the unit mind, as a result of spiritual practice, tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.

<!-- Since the beginning of creation, humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness. -->

The non-uniformity of speed changes the unit mind's movement to an elliptical force.
- The motion changes to oval from circular.

<!-- They get merged in the Macrocosmic Nucleus who aspire for Him as the ultimate destiny.  -->


## Táraka Brahma

Taraka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.

It happens when the Objectless Existence (Nirguńa Brahma), by His own will, takes the help of the 5 layers to come within the scope of Existence (Saguńa Brahma) as a physical entity*.  

{{< n n="Taraka Brahma becomes real if the person wants to rush to the Nucleus. Unlike an avatar who is the God in physical form, Taraka Brahma is Nothing that temporarily becomes a unit Something to speed up the journey of a unit mind to Nothing." >}}


Those who aim at mokśa do sádhaná to completely surrender the self into <!-- That --> Objectless Existence. <!-- Nirguńa Brahma, the Objectless Consciousness), -->
- They get out of this Cycle of Existence <!-- Brahma Cakra --> by a tangential touch of Táraka Brahma Who is within the scope of both Existence and Objectless Existence. 

<!-- In Tantra, the whole creation is known as sambhúti.  -->

<!-- When Táraka Brahma takes the assistance of the 5 layers, it is called His Mahásambhúti. -->

In Tantra sádhaná<!--  or in Ananda Marga sádhaná -->:
- one who aims at the Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> merges in Saguńa Brahma
- one who aims at Objectless Existence <!-- Nirguńa Brahma --> becomes surrendered into the Objectless Entity Nirguna.

Only Tantra has the sádhaná of Táraka Brahma which:
- has its own peculiarity
- is <!--  has been specially defined --> distinct from the sádhaná of Nirguńa and Saguńa. 

Theoretically, <!-- Saguńa Brahma --> Existence has infinite saḿskáras. 
- So for an infinite time to come, Existence <!-- Saguńa Brahma --> will continue to enjoy the fruit of Its own past actions.

The Objectless Entity or Nirguńa has no action or derivation. 
- Táraka Brahma is the middle point between Existence and Objectless Existence
- He can fulfill the function of both. 
- He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters who then surrender to Him.

<!-- His children say that He cannot live without loving them and address Him:

{{< q >}}
“O our great Father, our affectionate Mother, our All, we remember Thee, we adore Thee. O Witnessing Entity, we offer our homage to Thee, Thou art the only rescue in this crude worldly ocean, so to Thee we surrender ourselves.” 
{{< /q >}} -->

This complete surrender is the summum bonum of all spiritual sádhaná, which only can lead to Him from where decline is not even imaginable. 

Really blessed is one who has attained this complete surrender unto Him, like the piece of salt which went to measure the depth of the ocean. 
- A momentous divine jerk and an attraction occurred
- The bit of salt was lost, no one knows where.

**Táraka Brahma is not a figure of philosophy. It is a creation of devotional sentiment.**


## Avatára

<!-- The advent of Mahápuruśa is misinterpreted as incarnation. Incarnation is an illogical hypothesis. 
The whole universe being created out of Him and by Him is His incarnation.  -->

Avatáraváda is the incarnation theory. It hypothesizes that:
- the avatar is the direct descent of the Almighty and is the Macrocosmic Nucleus
- the rest of His creation has an unexplained <!--  as to its --> source of origin.

"Avatára" means a “derivation”, from "ava" and "tr", meaning “descend”, “derive” or “degenerate”. 
- It is wrong to call to individual minds who are far advanced in subtilification as avatars. 
- It is illogical for the Macrocosm to metamorphose Himself directly into some unit structure, in most cases a human being. 

<!-- Human beings are the most evolved individual units as a class in His creation.  -->

Every stage of the elevated psychic beings <!-- elevated psychic Mahápuruśa --> is the result of crudification and then subtilification. 
- **It is a gradual elevation and not an abrupt descent or occurrence.**

Logically, any unit consciousness is an incarnation of God. <!--  or to say that the Messenger of God traverses the path of saiṋcara, goes through a process of evolution and importance, and through psychic dilation in the process of pratisaiṋcara reaches different stages of elevation. --> 

<!-- The incarnated being, according to this dogma of degeneration of Puruśottama, cannot have an equal status with Puruśottama.  -->

When the psychic status of a created being assumes sameness with the Cosmic Entity, the unit psychic entity actually merges into the Cosmic Mind leaving no dualism.
- Hence how can the Macrocosmic Nucleus be equal with <!-- imagined existing as --> any separate entity in any stage within Brahma Cakra? 

<!-- The whole theory of incarnation or avatáraváda is, therefore, not convincing and rational for an intellectual analysis. -->

Behind the superstitious belief of avatáraváda lies one more social current created by a class of vested interests. 

Inquisitiveness and reasoning is a natural impulse in human beings.

There was a reaction against the illogical faiths and superstitions prevalent in society because of:
- pressing circumstances or 
- intellectual renaissance
 
These superstitions led to the exploitation of society by intellectual parasites who had learnt to live on the blood and labour of others.
- To maintain their domination through superstition, these parasites:
  - invented means to curb this growth of reaction and intellectual rationalism and
  - presented to the mass a sentimental appeal. 

Any command, rational or irrational, was enforced on society with so-called divine force by enunciation of the incarnation theory. 
- Corruption was perpetrated in the name of God.
- All those raising their heads against such commands or preachings were called reactionaries, atheists, and curbed drastically. 
  - “Give the dog a bad name and hang it,” was their motto.
- They went to the extent of manipulating, polluting and misinterpreting even the precious writings of many great ancient philosophers<!--  whose work had been respected as religious treatises from ancient times – all with an ulterior motive, to get their interests served -->.
