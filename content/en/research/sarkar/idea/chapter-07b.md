Every stage results from the previous stages. 
- Even the stage after formation of the unit mind is the effect of all the past stages. 

"Saḿskára" is the effect of action in the past stages.
- It gives momentum to the unit mind. 


### Crudification

The initial creation of the unit mind is the result of certain forces reacting in crudification. 

The ultimate cause of momentum of every force is the Macrocosm. <!-- , the entire working principle in saiṋcara and pratisaiṋcara. It is, --> Therefore, the Macrocosm:
- works through the media of microcosms
- provides the momentum for the unit mind. 

The attraction of the Great accelerates such momentum. 
- At the nucleus point where the first manifestation of Activity took place, the momentum of creation lay latent.

The momentum of the universe is the momentum by the Cosmos through:
- the media of microcosms and
- the medium of the inanimate portion of the Macrocosm. 

This is the play of One in many forms. Before the formation of microcosms:
- only the Macrocosm existed
- all projected activities lay in the Macrocosm
- all the diversities were in collective unity there. 

All the Cosmos resides in Him. Therefore, there is no question of life, death or saḿskára in this inanimate phase of creation (from the first bursting out of Prakrti, to the development of crudest solid matter).


### Subtlification

In the journey of subtlification, the crude mind gets momentum from the Macrocosm. 
- In the first stage, the microcosm evolves neither ego <!-- (ahaḿtattva) --> nor identity<!-- mahattattva -->, so it is devoid of any saḿskára. 
<!-- The eternal force of the Macrocosm moves the microcosms further towards the Nucleus. -->
- In a later stage, the ego is evolved but the unit mind feels it and accepts it as a possessor of saḿskára or momentum. 
- Afterwards, a stage comes when this ego starts controlling the mental activities.

This stage in evolution is represented by human beings. 
- Humans instead of going further towards the divine goal according to the movement of pratisaiṋcara can retrace, or adopt the path of negative pratisaiṋcara.*

{{< n n="*In particle physics, this is called this beta decay" >}}


The momentum for this negative movement being the accepted momentum of the unit mind, it is said that the saḿskára of any living animal inferior to the human is “infused” but that of the human is “acquired”.

Because of their less-developed ego, inferior animals continue to march on the path of subtlification. 

Humans, on the other hand, can retrace their path by adopting mean objectives.

While maintaining the unit structure of any object in the animated phase of evolution, proper adjustment amongst mental waves, physical waves and the vital energy (práńáh) is essential. 

Any object, mental or physical, always emanates waves.
- If these waves from the physical body and the mental body have a parallelism, then and then only is a cooperative unit structure maintained.

This parallelism can be lost as well, causing a dissociation of the composite factors by a maladjustment or unadjustable elevation or degradation of any one of the constituent factors. 

In the animated phase of evolution elevation occurs due to physical clash, psychic clash, or the attraction of the Supreme. 

For example, if a dog comes in contact with a human, the mental waves of the dog contact and clash with the waves of the human.
- Thereby, the dog’s mental waves get evolved and attain a greater wavelength.
- A stage may be reached when the dog's evolved mental wavelength loses proper adjustment with its physical structure. 
- This loss in parallelism will cause dissociation.
- The dissociated mind will have to find a physical body with which it can find proper adjustment.
- We say that the animal has “died” and undergone a corporal change.

A psychic clash with higher thought brings about the better wavelength.
- It thereby becomes the cause of a more evolved physical body.

And so, contact and clash with meaner thought will lessen the wavelength of the mental waves. 
- This will lead to a loss of parallelism as well, causing the physical and psychic bodies to dissociate from each other. 

For example, if a person's mental wavelength cannot adjust properly with the human body, his psychic body will have to associate with another <!-- properly adjustable --> physical structure such as <!-- , which may be of -->:
- an inferior animal
- a plant, or
- crude matter.

The epic Rámáyańa tells of Ahalyá, the wife of Gaotama Muni, being transformed into stone for some sin done by her. 
- It illustrates the process of negative pratisaiṋcara. 

<!-- rarefy -->
The imbibing of waves of higher wavelengths can decompress the psychic body of a lower animal or plant, so that it can associate with the human physical structure. <!-- , and vice versa, if the wavelength is made cruder by inculcating meaner thoughts. -->
- Life arises from the association by proper adjustment and parallelism between the psychic and physical bodies.
- Death is the dissociation under adverse conditions. 

Such association can also take place if the waves of the physical structure get cruder due to:
- old age or
- any other physical deficiency.

Here the physician may come to help and restore the physical body the requisite wavelength.

<!-- by some means or other attribute to  -->

**Through science, the lifespan can be made longer by properly adjusting the waves of the physical bodies.**

But if a change in the mental body be made by changing the brain, its personality itself will also get changed. 

Such a change will mean the transformation of the person himself, and thus not Mr. X but Mr. Y shall regain life.
