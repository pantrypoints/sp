[An Editor’s note in Prajina Bharati October 1983]

There has been some confusion regarding 2 previous births of Baba:

1. In a family of a Muslim fakir
2. As Ram Chandra Upadhyaya

Actually, **Anandamurtiji and Prabhat Ranjain Sarkar are two different entities**. 

These 2 births have been referred to Shrii Prabhat Ranjain Sarkar. 

Baba writes that Taraka Brahma is a devotional concept.* 
- Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji is the Taraka Brahma. 

{{< n n="This is why PR Sarkar comes to be an ordinary man to non-devotees -- because he really is an ordinary man like the Muslim fakir and Ram Chandra Upadhyaya. It is the devotion that makes Taraka Brahma appear as an emergent property" >}}


<!-- The author of Ananda Katha has given a very nice clarification on this subject. I shall try to publish the translation of
his clarification in the subsequent issue of Prajina Bharati.
Thanking you,

Appendix Two
A clarification by Naginaji
English translation of a letter written in Hindi dated 9.7.83 from Shrii Nagina to the
Editor of Ananda Yuga. Published in Prajina Bharati December 1983. -->

Dear Editor,

Namaskar,

In the 9th installment of Ananda Katha published in your esteemed journal ‘Ananda Yuga’ for the month of May-June 1983 at page 19 under head Namami Baba Jagatharnam Vishwarupam I have mentioned about the previous 2 lives of Baba as He told to me in 1955 at Jamalpur.

<!-- This act was given under inverted commas only with a view that everyone should know that  -->

It was revealed by Reverend Baba Himself. Nothing was added by me. 

I learned that this fact has hurt the sentiments of some of my brothers.

<!--  despite my best efforts to reproduce it in the same words of Reverend Baba.

I am neither a writer nor a critic. 

I do not have the required knowledge of writing and that too, about Revered Baba.  -->

This is why I requested you in the very beginning to spare me from this responsibility of writing Ananda Katha and to leave it as my treasure.

But you insisted. 

 <!-- were not at all prepared to extend any realisation to your order and finding no way out I had to comply. -->

You also insisted me to write in Hindi since Reverend Baba always used to talk with me in Hindi.

You thought that translation in any other language would not have been a faithful reproduction of Baba’s dialogue. 

<!-- I admit that there might be some faults in my art of writing and language but so far the facts relating to Revered Baba are concerned I cannot even imagine of any deviation.

Last time, when you met me, you were kind enough to make a reference about the previous two lives of Revered Baba and consequently, about hurting the sentiments of some of the Margii brothers when are so sincerely devoted to Revered Baba I tried my best to clarify the position and I felt you were convinced of the clarifications given by me.  -->

<!-- You left my place fully satisfied. But in absence of any clarification published so far,  -->

Some brothers expressed their views of not approving the idea of publishing the previous lives of Revered Baba. 

It was conveyed to me twice by one Shrii Ramswarnathji and once by Acarya Shrii Vishwanathji of Muzaffarpur. 

<!-- Matters relating to Reverend Baba said in all good faith and with full of reverence, will at all be a subject matter of discussion.  -->

<!-- I never thought of. I felt, it was really unfortunate. I admit that I am completely devoid of any higher spiritual realization karma (action) jinana (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion) but still some definite and pertinent questions have cropped up in my mind on hearing that my writings have hurt the Sentiments of my brothers.  -->

These questions that deserve a serious thought are:

1. Whatever I have reproduced about the previous 2 lives of Revered Baba was confirmed by Baba Himself.

 <!-- and this was why His sessions were given under inverted commas.  -->

For disciples, it is said in shastras that ‘Mantramulam Gururvakyam’, and will such discussions and talks of hurting the sentiments on the sayings of Revered Baba be in accordance with His honour?

2. Should the historical fact be ignored only because it may hurt the sentiments of someone?

3. During Emergency, very many excesses were done to the Marga and to Baba by the government itself. 

<!-- Such indigents of excesses must have offended very much the feelings of every Margii brother.  -->

Will such incidents be removed from the History of Ananda Marga only because it would hurt the sentiments of the Margii brothers?

4. At times, some disciples of Baba due to their very earnest and intense sadhana take Baba bhava and start feeling themselves to have become Baba Anandamurtiji.

Does it mean that they will also be called Mahakaul and Mahasambhuti like Revered Baba Anandamurtiji? 

If not, will it not hurt their sentiments too?

5. Why some of the speeches (pravacan), compiled in forms of books of Reverend Baba are published in the name of Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji while others in the name of Shri Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar?
