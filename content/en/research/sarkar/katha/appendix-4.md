LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Shri Editor,

I have gone through the letters to the Editor’ column published in your esteemed magazine, Prajina Bharati, for February, 1984.

<!-- Unfortunately, I could no go through it earlier because of its late arrival and hence I am late in sending
my reply. -->

Regarding the Ananda Katha series, so far it had only been the question of hurting the sentiments of my fellow Margii brothers.

But now, Acarya Shri Hari Shamkarji has outright doubted the truthfulness of the facts in Ananda Katha.

<!-- not one of hurting the feelings of devotees, but -->
He says that the prime question is of recording satya for the benefit of posterity.

<!-- When he taken this statement of facts, particularly those told by Reverend  -->

He believes that Baba's statement about Himself as Shri Ram Chandra Upadhyayaji is not satya. And so he has the full privilege of treating the whole of Ananda Katha as asatya (not satya).

However, how can it be partly satya and partly asatya? 

<!-- To be very frank, I cannot force him to accept it as Satya, although in the same letter he both praises my contribution and complains about my not recording Satya. It appears like he is blowing both hot and cold air simultaneously
in the same breath. -->

<!-- Like Hari Katha, Ananda Katha is also Ananda. 

Even if thousands of crores of people like me write Ananda Katha, still it will remain mysterious, unresolved and incomplete.  -->

If what Baba has said is not satya, then what else is satya? 

Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji should tell us what is the satya.

Is it not a fact that we address Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji, who is Taraka Brahma, Mahasambhuti and Mahakaul expressed in the form of Prabhat Rainjan, as Baba?

Is it at all possible to separate Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji from the present form of Prabhat Rainjan? 

We know Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji only through the present from of Shrii Shrii Prabhat Rainjanji. So any controversy becomes meaningless.

<!-- Even though a voluminous thesis can be written in support of my contentions on each point mentioned in my letter dated 9.7.83 and duly published in the December 1983 issue of your magazine) still then Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji considers it to be asatya. -->

I think there are only 3 alternatives:

1. He should ask Baba Himself and settle the issue for good

<!-- , without making it unnecessarily controversial any more. -->

2. If he can believe the major portion of Ananda Katha to be Satya, he must also believe that the portion in goes from is equally Satya.

3. If thinks that portion of Ananda Katha as outright untrue and false, he should forbid me from producing it any further. 

<!-- I assure him with humility and humbleness that if true. I will stop it forthwith. But I would like to report very sincerely that he is no way until this is determined confuse and confoundthe issue any further He has the right to brand me a liar but he should not doubt the sayings of Reverend Baba.

I am not even well versed in my mother tongue, let alone in a foreign language like English. So I could not exactly follow what he meant by the term communication gap. 

This needs elucidation for my understanding. -->

<!-- For me, philosophy is a very terse, difficult, and not-easily adaptable subject.

But what little bit I could and did learn about philosophy, sitting under the lotus feet of Reverend Baba, Taraka Brahma, is beyond the scope of philosophy. 

Taraka Brahma, or Brahma in any form (be it saguna or nirguna) can be better realized than justified or declined through philosophy. 

Ultimately, he is beyond the scope of language and philosophy both.  -->

In paragraph 2 of his letter, Acaryaji Hari Shankar has defined the Taraka Brahma as He who takes human form after assigning a role for Himself.

I never differ with him. But it is completely the prerogative and supreme wish of he Taraka Brahma for choosing the human form to express himself on earth.

His reason for choosing a particular human form cannot be questioned or challenged. His reasons are beyond the limits and capabilities of our quite limited and small human minds.

<!-- I am no longer an acarya. The word acarya is very, very dignified and honorable. It should be removed from my name. In that way, we may preserve the sanctity of the word.


With Baba Nam Kevalam -->

Yours very truly
Sd. Nagina
