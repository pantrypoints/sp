To The Editor

Dear Sir,

<!-- Only on 6 instant I could go through the letter of  appearing in Prajina Bharati for October 1984. -->

The letter of Revered Acarya Shri Santoshanandaji Avadhuta is more amusing and interesting than that of Reverend Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji.

 <!-- and I feel very much obliged for this. -->

During your last visit to Muzaffarpur you personally gave me several copies of Prajina Bharati of July 84 for sale.

In this issue my letter addressed to the editor was published against the comments of Revered Acarya Shri Hari Shankarji. 

After going through that letter in Prajina Bharati, I found it to be amended to some extent at your end and I requested you to issue a corrigendum to it which could never be published. 

<!-- So far I could know that Reverend Baba always remained very busy but never knew that He is unapproachable even for consultation on important issues. But now it is a revelation to me for which I am very much grateful to   Acarya Shri Santoshanandaji Avadhuta.
-->

<!-- Till now, neither the stock of  not my zeal to write it further had exhausted but of course  -->

The letter of Acarya Shri Santoshanandaji Avadhuta in Prajina Bharati of October 84 has completely dampened my spirit and zeal in writing Ananda Katha.*

{{< n n="In other words, the forces of staticity and dogma defeated the forces of satya and devotion" >}}

<!-- Now, I really feel exhausted with the result I have totally stopped writing Ananda Katha any further. Thanks to revered acaryaji. -->

This led me to decide finally to request you most sincerely not to publish Ananda Katha any further.

I request that the rest of my manuscript of 14th and 15th installments of Ananda Katha be returned to me urgently.

Even if some portion of the manuscript of Ananda Katha has been sent to the press, it should be taken back and returned to me without second thought.

<!-- I shall be thankful to your this kindness.  -->

My decision on this is unchangeable and unalterable at no cost I would like any further publication Ananda Katha.

The subject matter of Ananda Katha always remained sacred and pious treasure for me which I never thought of revealing to the world and what to talk of writing about it at all.

But your persistent and repeated request compelled me to write Ananda Katha and publish it.

Please publish the Hindi translation of this letter in Ananda Yuga also.

<!-- It is not possible for me to translate it now, and so kindly take trouble of getting it done at your end, for which I will remain obliged.

With your permission I also take the latitude of expressing my heartfelt gratitude, feelings and thanks in abundance to  -->

I thank the revered critics of Ananda Katha and finally bid them good bye through your esteemed journal.

<!-- Thanking you once more. -->

Yours faithfully
Nagina
