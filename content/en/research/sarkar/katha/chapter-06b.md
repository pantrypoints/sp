Next morning again there was a call from that office. 

When I presented myself before Asthanaji, he seemed ready to go out. He was going to Baba for initiation. He asked me also to accompany him. 

I refused and said:

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
Baba had instructed me just to give His postal address to you and you should find out his residence yourself. Please do not make me violate His instructions.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- For me to do anything beyond this would be a violation of His instructions, which I am not prepared to do at any price. Baba is all knowing and all pervading.  Whatever we do is in full knowledge of Baba.” -->


At this, Asthanaji told me that he would drive the car himself. 

There would be neither the driver nor the orderly with him. As there are so many cross roads in Monghyr with which he was not familiar, he therefore wanted me to guide his way only until he reached a point outside Monghyr and on the road to Jamalpur, then he would reach the place himself.

I agreed to do this much.

He then took the driving seat in his car and I sat beside him. I brought him on the road to Jamalpur, through the crossings and requested him to stop so that I could return. He pointed out that no rickshaw was available there and therefore, how would I walk all the way back. He therefore, suggested that I should go a little further with him until I get a vehicle to return.

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
You want me to go with you up to Jamalpur. Alright, but I will not assist you in anyway to Baba's residence. I am turning
deaf and dumb for you right from now onwards
{{< /r >}}

I said this and then sat in the car with my face to the back.

My boss laughed at this. When the car reached a crossing near Jamalpur railway station, he looked at me, but I turned my face away. After some time, he stopped, asked a gentleman who was walking on the road about the way to Kashavpur and then moved ahead in his car in that direction. I was looking just opposite to the direction in which Baba's residence was situated, so that he may not see the expressions on my face and guess the location of Baba's residence.

As the car reached some twenty five to thirty yards ahead of Baba's residence,
he suddenly stopped the car and told himself in my hearing that it appeared that Baba's
residence was somewhere near and we had gone a little ahead. So saying, he got
down from the car and asking neighbours, reached Baba's residence.

When, he returned to the car, he told me that the gate of Baba's residence was
open and he found Baba seated on a chair. 

He was very happy after the initiation and when he said that Nagina was in the car, Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
He knows my time and he will come only at that time.
{{< /l >}}


All the way he continued to ask so many things about Baba.

On returning to Monghyr, I got busy in government work and in the evening reached Baba's residence for His darshan. I had His darshan, had an opportunity to do my pranam and then accompanied Him on His walk.

When Baba sat down on the grave in the field, I asked him:

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
Baba, when the gentleman who got initiation this morning was coming to You, he told me that Baba's residence was near when he reached near Your house. He then came to your house by enquiring about it from the neighbours. How did it come
into his mind that Your house was near?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
When I saw that you were sitting at his side looking in the opposite direction as if you had nothing to do with him, I motivated him to stop the car and come to me.
{{< /l >}}

Great is Baba's Grace!


## Asthanaji Receives Baba's Grace

Some 2 months later, Asthanaji came to Monghyr again. The next day he, called me from Begusarai. 

When I reached the place of his stay I discovered that he had come along with his entire family but he had not come out of his room since morning. 

I thought he might be busy with some personal or confidential work, but when I sent word of my arrival, he called me to his room. I was most astounded to see what was happening there. Asthanaji was lying on his bed and tears were flowing incessantly from his eyes. When I enquired about this, he started weeping still more bitterly and asked me to sit down by his side.

His wife was also there. She told me that since the morning after his bath he had been like that. He had not even combed his hair after taking bath.

When I looked at him, I found that his hair was dishevelled. His wife appeared worried and he had forbidden anyone from outside be told about his
condition.

He asked his wife also to go out of the room for some time. When she had left and we were alone, he told me his story. He said that after taking his bath he had come out of the bathroom and approached the dressing table to do his hair. He stood in front of the mirror, which was big enough to reflect his whole body, and saw that Baba was standing in the mirror. He was standing in front of the mirror, and normally the mirror should have reflected his own image, but instead, he saw Baba there and was extremely surprised at it. He could not rely on his own eyes, and several times rubbed his eyes to see clearly, but he found that Baba was still standing in the mirror. At this, he felt such a pleasant sensation that he lost the consciousness of his body and began to shed tears of joy incessantly.

Hearing him and looking at him, I myself began to feel a sensation of ecstasy and began to wonder at the infinite liila of Baba. How compassionate He is to His devotees. Wherever His devotees may be, Baba is always with them. When Asthanaji took time to come out of the dressing room, his wife came in, and when she saw his condition she was amazed. She questioned him, but got no reply. She therefore became worried.

I enquired whether he was feeling any strain due to the constant weeping. He informed me that along with the flow of tears he was feeling a sweet sensation in his heart and was thus enjoying bliss. But his difficulty was how to show himself to people outside in this condition. Saying this, he again began to weep profusely and his wife came into the room when she heard his weeping. I told her not to worry at all and only advised her to remain indoors to avoid any embarrassment.

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
[To Asthanaji] In the evening when I go for Baba's darshan I shall inform Him about you.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Asthanaji" >}}
Please do not tell to Baba about it; lest my bliss will end. Stay with me.
{{< /l >}}

And so that day I could not go for Baba's darshan in the evening.

I had to stay on in Monghyr and next day again presented myself at Asthanaji’s place at around 7am. 

When I met him I found that he was still not in a normal state. I told him that it would be better if he accompanied me to Begusarai and stayed there for a couple of days and returned here after he became normal. 

He agreed with my suggestion, and it was decided that his family would go with me to Begusarai. In the afternoon, we took a boat at such a time that we reached Begusarai by evening in view of his condition. He stayed there for three days and when he had become absolutely normal he returned to Bhagalpur.

<!-- I finish this story of Baba's liila here and after saluting Him humbly pray that He
may grant such ecstasy to every one of his devotees.
 -->
