They saw me approaching from the lane. One of them rushed to me and informed me that Mainju was dead.

I scolded him for this and remembered that Baba had said only a few days back that I was not destined to suffer the loss of any of my children. How could this then happen? 

Thinking on these lines and remembering Baba, 

I rushed towards my house.

Everyone including the doctor was in the sitting room. As soon as I stepped into the
sitting room I enquired where was Mainju. The doctor and the assembled people
pointed to the dining table, where Mainju was lying with her face covered, as she had
been declared dead by the doctors. 

I reached the table and to everyones surprise, Mainju uncovered her face herself and leaped towards me calling me “Baba” in Bengali.

Remembering Baba all the time I took her in my lap. She was about one at that time. 

The doctors were totally amazed. They immediately jotted down a prescription and sent one of my office men to purchase the medicines. Meanwhile, my domestic assistant informed me that my wife was lying unconscious in another room, from the shock. 

I took Mainju in my lap and went near my wife and brought her to senses by sprinkling some water on her face. As soon as she revived she lifted Mainju up in her arms.

I bade farewell to the doctors after paying their fees. Everyone present there
was happily surprised by seeing that a child declared dead by two doctors was up and
healthy again and all began to praise the grace of Baba. 

I was feeling extremely happy remembering the death destroying Grace of Baba in my mind. I was numb with overpowering feelings of devotion for Baba.

I thought, "How kind Baba is. He removes the troubles of his devotees, before
they strike them”. I had no words to express Baba's grace. I surrendered myself
completely in words, thoughts and deeds to Baba and prayed that I might sing His
praise all my life. I hope Baba will grant me this.

After the commotion had setteld, we had out lunch. I told my wife that Baba has
only given a warning to us, but if we don't apply the treatment shown by Him, there
would certainly be a chance for calamity in future. While thus talking we saw the maid
taking the cleaned utensils inside the house. Amongst them was one utensil of brass
which had no handle and was like a tub. I suggested that Mainju could sit in this and be
bathed. If the edge will pain her outstretched legs we will put a towel on the edge to
protect her. My wife agreed with my suggestion. From that day on we bathed Mainju as
per Baba's instructions, in that utensil. We did not use the doctor's medicines. By
Baba's Grace Mainju never got that kind of fit against after this.

After this incident, my wife also insisted on being initiated. How can I bring
within the fold of language the description of his compassion? Hie whose description the Vedas failed to achieve and finally came to the statements of 'Not this, not this!’ 

I can only silently say that Baba is extremely compassionate and He showers Hisblessings equally on His disciples as well as those who are not. He is ever ready to take them under His shelter.
When I visited Baba's place next, I requested for my wife's initiation and Baba
was kind enough to agree. When I was walking with Baba I asked that this sadhana is
so good, why should it be given on the basis of pick and choose. Kindly make it
available to all.


## My Wife Takes Initiation From Baba

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Diiksa (initiation) and sadhana are given only after seeing the samskaras (karma) of the individual. But as you are insistent, let me know the names and addresses of those who are the seekers of Eternal Knowledge. I shall permit them on the basis of samskaras.
{{< /l >}}


After seeing the change in me after the initiation, many people thought of also taking initiation.
- Some of them were officers in my department and some were mere acquaintances.

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
May I bring my wife for initiation next Sunday?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Yes, but do not bring any small child with her.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
But my youngest child cannot be left at home.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The kundalinii of children below 5 is in a fluid state. It gets aggravated by my contact and causes them pain.
{{< /l >}}

Therefore, when we came next time the young girl was with us but we tried to
lull her to sleep before going to Baba and by Baba's Grace she did go to sleep. After
this, we handed her over to Bindeshwariji and I took my wife to Baba for initiation. Only
when we returned after my wife's initiation did my daughter wake up. It was His Grace
that until we returned she remained asleep. This was the same girl who was declared
dead some days ago by the doctors.

This time I also brought a list of those who were desirous of taking initiation and
I submitted that list to Baba. Baba thought for a moment and allowed some of them and
some names of the list were not allowed. Along with this for each person the date and
time of initiation was also fixed. I informed the people about the date and time and gave
their addresses to Bindeshwariji, who took them to Baba's lotus feet at the appointed
time. I had already requested Bindeshwariji to take these persons to Baba and he
agreed readily.

This process of submitting lists continued up to December 1954. Personal
contact was the only medium for spreading the mission and Baba’s ideals. Any
reference to guru was forbidden.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The motivation inculcated by reference to the guru will not be permanent. Guru will not live forever, and when the physical form will be no more, your efforts will come to a halt. Therefore, always propagate the ideal.
{{< /l >}}


Following His instructions we were always talking about the ideals and
spreading it through personal contact. Up to that time Ananda Marga had not come into
existence - nor was there any book containing a philosophy or code of conduct.
Whatever we heard from Baba was our philosophy and code of conduct, and we were
taking only its help for our propagation of the philosophy and practice Baba had given.
