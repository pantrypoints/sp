<!-- It was at this time that something memorable and inspiring happened. It will be
appropriate to mention it here. -->

One of my subordinates was a Muslim officer. In October 1954, he said:

{{< l a="Staff" >}}
Tomorrow is a holiday. I would like to request for your car and driver to bring my pir (Muslim holy man) from the station
{{< /l >}}


He informed me that the pir would be coming from Muzaffarpur and he is known amongst people as Datta Rajendra Shah.

He told me that Datta had been one of the famous advocates of Monghyr. 

One day while he was arguing a case in the court, he declared that the call from the Almighty had come and he was giving up his profession. 

Thus, he left the court in the midst of the arguments.

He distributed his gown, expensive clothes and money on the way, purchased a dhoti of fine muslin and a blanket from a shop and went to the Muzaffarpur to his guru, where he started living. 

He broke off all his relations with his family and friends in order to live in complete seclusion.

As I also belonged to Muzaffarpur District, I had heard about him but had not seen him. My talk with my subordinate officer aroused my curiosity and I said, 

{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
I shall myself come with my car and bring him
{{< /r >}}


Next day I went to Barauni and found many people had gathered there. They had all come to welcome the saint. 

I also met amongst them one of my old college mates who was SDO Monghyr at that time. When his train whistled in, my friend pointed to a first class compartment and told that the the saint was in there. 

The platform was crowded with people who had come to welcome him. 

When the crowd dispersed, my subordinate officer called me inside the compartment and introduced me to his Guru. I saw him in a while muslin dhoti, half of which he had wrapped around his waist and the other half was covering his upper body. 

There was a black blanket and a stick on one side of him. There was also bottle of wine and a glass nearby which his followers were taking care of. Despite this evidence of his drinking alcohol, there was a spiritual glow on his face. I touched his feet.

People helped him to get down from the train, and he came and sat in the car, I brought him from there to Begusarai and when I was about to return home, he said:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
Are you going?
{{< /l >}}

I told him that I was going to, take my bath and do my sadhana. He asked me to return after I finished my work.

That evening in my meditation I had some experience of Islamic nature. When I went to meet him in the evening, I took my seat in the second row, just in front of him.

Those in charge of arrangements were insisting on my taking a seat in the front row. But I did not agree, as I was not familiar with the ways and discipline of that gathering.

There was a group of musicians to his right that was singing 'qawali' (Islamic devotional music). From time to time his men were handing him cups full of wine.

Although in the second row, I was quite close to him, yet there was no smell of liquor. After some time Datta began to sway forwards and backwards in his seat. When he swayed forwards he came very close to me.

While swaying like this, he once came close to me and said:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
Nagina, guru alone takes one to God
{{< /l >}}


After some time in another similar swing he said:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
Ho! Guru is God Himself.
{{< /l >}}

That evening he did not tell me anything else, but again and again my hair was standing on end.

Next day I went to him again during the noontime. The room was full of people. There was a big crowd in front of the door also.

Even so I stood near the door. He looked at me and asked when I had come. I replied that I had just arrived. He called me in and asked me to be seated.

Meanwhile his food arrived. He took his meal and afterwards betel-nut was served on a plate. He ate one betel and was handing one to each person as his 'prasad'. 

I decided in my mind that I wouldn’t accept the betel. 

I wished that he might not give me one. Ultimately it happened as I desired. He gave one betel each to everyone except me. I was feeling attracted towards him.

I was a new recruit in the field of sadhana, even so, mentally I placed Baba in Dattaji's figure.

As I did this Dattaji laughed aloud:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
Nagina you are wondering as to what I am?
{{< /l >}}


He called me near and said in Arabic:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
“ba isma ba mosamba"
{{< /l >}}


<!-- I did not follow the meaning of these words to I began to look at his face.  -->

A gentleman was asked to explain the meaning to me. He told me that the meaning of this expression is that ‘qualities follow the name’. I was silent.

During that visit he did many miraculous things for several people, such as curing the daughter-in-law of a devotee by sending her a glass of water from which he had drunk. 

He also revived the fevered, uinconscious daughter of a destitute follower by anointing her teeth with his own saliva. Then he departed.

He was to go next day by the morning train and I had to take him to the station.

When I reached the station with him the train was late. He squatted on the floor of the platform. Many people had come to see him off. People surrounded him and there also he gave many miscellaneous blessings to his followers. When the train arrived he called me and asked me why I had not requested for anything from him while others had done so.


{{< r a="Nagina" >}}
You know best. I do not know what to ask for
{{< /r >}}


He immediately said:

{{< l a="Dattaji" >}}
On the 17th day from today I shall send you the Mukhtare Ahamad.
{{< /l >}}


I did not understand this Urdu expression.
