During December 1954, some disciples wanted to establish an organisation to speed up the spread of Baba’s ideals and they requested Him to give them permission in this regard.

Baba made some enquiries and kindly consented.

In order to prepare the constitution of this Samgha, some disciples gathered on the 25 December 1954. Fortunately I also went to Jamalpur that day and when I was going to Baba in the morning, they, together with Baba, met me on the way. I touched

Baba's feet in pranam and found Baba in a very pleasant mood.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Today some people are going to write the constitution of the Samgha. You should go and help them and come to meet me at four in the afternoon
{{< /l >}}


Baba left after telling me this. Shri Deep Narayanji and Dr. Vishvanathji were with me. Shri Vishvanathji had been my classmate since childhood and had taken initiation on my request recently. We thought the matter over and decided to go for writing the constitution after taking our meal, as the writing of the constitution was going to take time. Thus we returned to Bindeshwariji's house and began to prepare to go after taking our lunch.


## I Incur Baba’S Wrath

In the meanwhile two other brother disciples came to Bindeshwariji. They also had the same task in mind. I was a big smoker then, but despite this I decided not to take my cigarette case with me. Earlier also I had never taken my cigarette tin with me to Baba's place. As in Jamalpur I always stayed with Bindeshwariji, I always left my cigarette case there. I wanted to do the same this time also. I was following this practice just to observe good manners. I never had the inclination to give it up altogether. Cigarette smoking was a great weakness with me.

Both my brother disciples said that I would be required there to write for a long time and so I should take my cigarettes with me. Even then I did not agree, but Vishvanathji took the box in his hands offered to take it himself. So they started and we followed them. I did not thin that it was good that someone else was carrying my cigarette tin for me, so I took it from him. Thus we reached that quarter of the railway colony where we were to write the constitution. I left my cigarettes outside on a window ledge and entered the room. My brother disciple suggested that I should bring my cigarettes inside with me, but I disagreed and left them outside.

In the room we spread a blanket on the floor and started deliberating on the constitution. On one side there was a small wooden bed with cushions on it. On that
bed there was a photograph of Baba in varabhaya mudra, in a beautiful frame. 

Shri Pranay Kumar Chatterjee used to stay in this house and we were under the impression
that this was his quarter. 

Baba had given demonstrations in the back room of this very same house during the previous month of November 1954. 

After some discussion the composition began and everyone asked me to write. I started doing so under their dictation.

The writing continued for a long time. At about three in the afternoon I sought permission to go out for five minutes for a stretch. They sensed my need and asked whether I was going out for a smoke. I replied in the affirmative. At this they suggested that I could smoke in the room itself. I objected to this as it would be quite impolite andinconsiderate but as I was going out I was stopped and someone rose and brought my cigarette tin from outside.

As I was about to light my cigarette, Shri Pranayji who stayed in that house, took away Baba's photograph to another room and placed an earthen ashtray for me.

When he was taking away Baba's photograph I again said:

{{< l a="Shri Pranayji" >}}
what are you doing? I shall go out myself. Kindly keep the photo here.
{{< /l >}}

Even then he did not agree and took the photograph away into another room. I felt very pained at this. Unwillingly I lit the cigarette and after one or two puffs it went
out. 

I tried to light it again, but meanwhile the last match burned itself out without lighting the cigarette.

We tried to write further, but the atmosphere had changed and we could not do so. Our minds were disturbed. At about three-thirty we stopped work as I had to reach
Baba's place at 4pm.


Shri Deep Narayanji and myself started towards Baba's place. When we reached there, we found Baba very angry. Just looking at His face we understood that this was His 'rudra rupa'. I had never seen Baba in this mood before. Both of us therefore were frightened. In this state of fear we tried to do pranam, but Baba said in an angry tone:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Get away!
{{< /l >}}

I was completely abashed, but Deep Narayanji fell at His feet. After seeing this I also took courage and did my sastaunga pranam.

Baba said in the same angry tone:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Go from here now, meet me in the quarter in the evening.
{{< /l >}}

Deep Narayanji and myself returned from Baba's place quickly.
