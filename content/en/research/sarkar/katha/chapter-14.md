While I was still at Jamalpur, it was decided that DMC of Maghi Full Moon would be held on February 5, 1955.

I was staying with Bindeshwariji, so I asked him also to attend it. Due to his family circumstances, it was rather difficult for him to go.

But I insisted so much that finally he agreed. His family also unwillingly allowed him to attend the DMC.

Both of us together went to Bhagalpur and that very evening participated in the DMC. The DMC was being held in a big room in the house of respectful Chandranathji.

At the time of DMC Bindeshwariji and myself were sitting a little apart from each other. I was in the fourth or fifth row in the front and Bindeshwariji was sitting on the left of the couch in the front row. As Baba's discourse was about to end suddenly Baba looked at Bindeshwariji and told him not to worry.


## Baba Grants New Life To Bindeshwariji

Everyone looked at Bindeshwariji. Bindeshwariji at that time was breathing heavily and sitting in sukhasana and was only uttering " No!” No! While we were trying to understand the situation Bindeshwariji kept calling out, "No! No!” and still sitting in sukhasana began to move towards Baba. 

He placed his head on Baba's lap and again began to call, “No!” No!” 

He was moving without taking any help of his hands in such a way as iron is drawn towards a magnet. We couldn't understand anything.

Baba motioned to me and asked that Bindeshwariji may be taken out. I helped Bindeshwariji to rise and took him to the drawing room and there laid him on a Sofa. 

There also he continued to repeat, " No! "No! In between he was uttering irrelevant or unintelligible things also.

I was in the meanwhile called in by Baba. I left Bindeshwariji to the care of other disciple brothers and went to Baba. Baba asked everyone else to leave the room.

When I was left alone with Baba, He said to me: 

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" >}}
At that time Bindeshwariji was dying, but as the place and time were not proper I had given him another lease of life. Also his body is old, but I have just given him pranah and mind, therefore he will behave like an infant. From today you will have to look after him just as one looks after a small child”. Don't tell Bindeshwariji that he was dying and I have deferred the moment.
{{< /q >}}

In my whole life, I had not looked even after my own children. How was I to look after him?

I had no experience of caring for children and how I was going to perform this duty in respect of an old child?

In this confused state of mind I reached Bindeshwariji and saw that he was surrounded by other disciple brothers. 

While lying sometimes he was laughing and sometimes he was calling the name of his wife and saying that today her husband has been saved from the jaws of death. 

His eyes were still closed, as they were when he was removed from Baba's presence and he was still breathing heavily. In that condition again he was again and again mentioning about his wife's good fortune that her
husband has survived.

I asked him "What are you saying? What has happened to you?"

At this he told me, "Today Baba has given me life back only on account of you and that is why my wife has been saved from widowhood. Had you not forcibly brought me here, my death was sure to take place at that time”.

I thought, “Baba had said that Bindeshwariji should not know this, but he is talking on his own about his death and the granting of new life to him. What has happened?”

I immediately returned to Baba and told Him, "Baba you said that Bindeshwariji should not know about his death but he himself is talking about his death and grant of life and about the good fortune of his wife."

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
How did it happen?
{{< /l >}}

I pleaded innocence and said that as I reached him he was already talking in this manner.

Baba closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them and said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
When he was dying I gave a portion of my mind and pranah to him and therefore he knows My mind. Anyway, let him say so, you will always tell him forcefully that he was talking nonsense. You will have to be very cautious and careful in this matter
{{< /l >}}


Now it was a second problem for me that Bindeshwariji would tell the truth and I would again and again tell him that he was wrong. 

Even otherwise it was difficult to take care of such an old child and now I was to go on telling him that he was not correct in his thought. On my own I could not manage this, therefore, I left everything on Baba and as ordered by Baba, began to look after him. In Bhagalpur when ever he would talk of the gift of life to him and about the saving of his wife's marital life, I would call his talk that of a mad man or say that he was talking nonsense, thus trying to quieten him. 

Sometimes Bindeshwariji would laugh away my statements and sometimes he would show his irritation at them. Although we did not stay long at Bhagalpur after the DMC, still this news spread amongst all the Margii brothers there.
