Baba is very fond of discipline yet he likes the rational acts of Margiis. 

Once I had to ask something about sadhana from Baba, but Baba was very busy. When after many attempts also I did not get an opportunity, I was forced to tell everything to the manager of the ashram.

I requested him to ask Baba about the solutions to my problems.

The manager asked Baba and told me. That day also like other days I went to Baba’s residence to do my sastaunga pranam and accompanied Him on his walk afterwards.

 <!-- Now look at the Lila of Baba. That day I was alone on the walk with Him. -->

Baba said, “I am both your acarya and guru,and even then you discussed matters related to sadhana with the ashram manager to be relayed to me! Why did you adopt this course?”

<!-- As I heard this question, I was reminded of the promise I had taken at the time
of initiation and I was struck dumb.
I said,  -->

“Baba, when ever after several attempts I did not get an opportunity to ask you myself, I had to refer them to you through the manger as he is also the General Secretary of the Marga”.


<!-- So you mentioned them to him as the General Secretary of the Marga?

I replied in the affirmative.  -->
Baba found this rational.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
“This is alright”

<!-- Thus, although earlier I did not get an opportunity to be with him for so many
days He now gave me all the time I needed.

## RAM BAHADUR SINGH: HIS INITIATION

While I was in Jamalpur staying with Bindeshwariji, one or his relations came on a visit. 

I knew him also. His name is Shri Ram Bahadur Singh. These days he was enforcement officer in the Transport Department of Bihar Government posted at Bhagalpur. 

Jamalpur was within his jurisdiction, he therefore, had to visit this place frequently, and whenever he would come to Jamalpur he would always pay a visit to Bindeshwariji, even though it may be a short one. Shri Bindeshwariji was always encouraging him to do sadhana.

Acarya Chandranathji and Acarya Kishanji were also amongst the friends of Shri Ram Bahadur Singhji and he was quite impressed by the change in lifestyle of these two persons due to sadhana. Thus in the summer of 1955, he also took initiation.

After some days his wife also got initiated. 

Both began to help each other in Sadhana.

In a very short time Shri Ram Bahadur Singh developed great faith and devotion for Baba Whenever he would come to Monghyr for any work he would always avail himself of Baba’s darshan. Meanwhile he was transferred to Patna.

In 1959, when Baba went to Patna he paid a surprise visit to Ram Bahadurji’s residence. Both the husband and wife were overwhelmed with emotion and felt very, very happy finding Baba as their guest. Both began to shed tears of devotion.

After two or three months Shri Ram Bahadur was transferred to Barhi. This is a small place, but an important road junction in South Bihar, and this posting was considered important in the transport department. 

Here he remained for about one and a half years only, but during this period while going to Ranchi and Gaya, he stayed at his house thrice. When Ram Bahadurji was narrating his experiences, his wife in her deep devotion would and her own with great pleasure. Shri Ram Bahadurji is very
fortunate in this respect everyone in his family from a child to the oldest is devoted to
Baba.

### RAM BAHADUR SINGH AND THE MYSTERY WATCH-DOGS

Once his wife told about their stay in Barhi, that Shri Ram Bahadurji had some trouble with his left eye and therefore had to be admitted to Patna hospital. She was alone in Barhi with her young children. As their residence was in a lonely place she became very much frightened and she began to pray to Baba for help. 

Baba heard her prayer and before evening that very day two strange strong black dogs – who were quite frightening in looks – all of a sudden came to his house and began to stay there. 

Both these dogs were extremely efficient in looking after the protection of the house and its inhabitants. Nobody could dare to roam in the vicinity of the house even.

Looking at their loyalty Shrimati Ram Bahadur felt somewhat reassured of her safety. For about two and a half months Shrii Ram Bahadurji was in the hospital and during his absence these black dogs continued to protect his house with great care. 

The day Shrii Ram Bahadurji returned from the hospital, these two dogs disappeared nobody knew where. None saw them ever thereafter. Who were they in the form of these two dogs from where they came and where they disappeared – we can know only if Baba kindly tells us about it. Their arrival and departure remained a mystery. 

Baba gives his grace in strange ways. If we think, we find that every action of his is a miracle.

Shrii Ram Bahadurji returned from the hospital on 16 October 1959 without any success and in a hopeless state. After two and a half months treatment the specialists and doctors told him that his eyesight could be restored only through god’s grace. According to the doctors the disease had no cure and he could never see with his left eye.


## BABA VISITS RAM BAHADUR

That very day at about nine in the morning Baba suddenly came to Barhi at Shrii Ram Bahadurji’s residence. This was the most happy surprise for him. Baba was on His way to DMC at Ranchi. Both husband and wife began to welcome and serve
Baba with great devotion and love. 

Acarya Shri Devii Chandra Sharma and another devoted sadhakas Shrii Balandaji where with Baba.

“I want to take my both and do my puja. If there is no difficulty, please arrange for the same.” said Baba.Then Baba told to Mrs. Ram Bahadurji, “Mother, you make arrangements for some food. I shall take my food after puja and then leave”.

Hearing these words from Baba’s mouth, both husband and wife felt extremely overwhelmed with joy and emotion, they began to dance with joy and their state was of extreme bliss.

The Lord himself comes and becomes a guest – will this not madden any devotee with joy? This was like Ram’s visit to the residence of Shabri or like Krsna coming to the house of Vidura. The mental condition of both husband and wife was like that of Vidura and Shabri. Both were, as if electrified and began to do Baba’s work with their own hands in great speed.

By the time Baba had finished His bath and sadhana, Mrs. Ram Bahadur had prepared tasty rich and various sattvika dishes for Baba’s food. 

Both husband and wife began to serve Baba with great love and hospitality and with Baba others were also served Baba took some rest while those who came with Him took their food and when they were ready, Baba also was prepared to start on His journey. 

Both husband and wife with their children did sastaunga pranam to Baba and were greatly satisfied when they received His blessings – they thanked their stars. Great are this couple and their
devotion.

Ram Bahadurji also accompanied Baba on His way.

On 16 and 17 October 1959, there was DMC at Ranchi where Baba delivered discourses to the Margiis and on the 18 Baba returned to Jamalpur. 

Acarya Amulya Ratan Sarangiji accompanied Baba from Ranchi and they passed through Dhanbad, Dumka and Bhagalpur on the way to Jamalpur, where they arrived the next day.

Acarya Sarangiji drove the car up to Dumka where Baba ordered Shri Ram Bahadurji to take the wheel. Shri Ram Bahadurji ignored the pain in his eye and without a hitch took the steering and began to drive. Although his left eye was in great pain, which continued up to Dumka Ram Bahadurji bone it without allowing its expression to come on his face.

He drove the car for about 120 miles in this condition and brought Baba to Jamalpur. It was a miracle that as long as he drove the car, the pain completely disappeared.


## BABA CURES RAM BAHADUR

Later Baba taught him a prescription for preparing an ainjana (eye-powder) and told him, “ By using this powder your eye will regain its normal health. “

But Ram Bahadurji had seen that as long as he was in the service of Baba and was driving the car, the pain had disappeared. He therefore did not pay any special need towards the prescription for the eye powder. After reaching Jamalpur, Ram Bahadurji left Baba at his residence and along with his companions came to the jagrti.
Here they stayed for three days and had the privilege of Baba’s darshan every morning
and evening.

On the third day, in the evening walk Shri Amulya Ratna Sarangi, Acarya Devi Chandra Sharma, Shri Balendriji and Shri Ram Bahadurji were with him. 

All of them went with Baba up to his residence. After reaching his house Baba told Shri Amulya Ratna Sarangi to take Ram Bahadurji up to Barhi. At that stage Acarya Devi Chandra Sharma prayed that Baba may be pleased and may cure the illness of Ram Bahadurji’s eye so that he may regain his eyesight.Baba said, “I have explained to him the method of preparing an eye-powder which will cure the pain in his eyes.”

Ram Bahadur was still silent when Baba spoke again and said, “I asked Ram Bahadur at the time of Hajipur DMG whether his health was alright and Ram Bahadur had replied that he never felt ill. Even so Baba looked at his ailing eye and said,
Na bhuktam kashiyate karma kalpa koti shatairapi
Avashyameva bhoktavyam kritam karma shubhashubham
Baba said, “When the flood comes, it leaves some effect behind”.

So saying Baba pressed his finger just above the left eye of Ram Bahadurji.

Shri Ram Bahadur felt that as Baba pressed his eye, instantaneously the pain in the eye disappeared and the also felt that some light entered his left eye. 

At about eleven o’clock in the night Ram Bahadur returned from Baba’s residence along with his friends and after reaching the Jagrti he tried to read the newspaper with his left eye. 

His wonder and joy knew no bounds, when he succeeded in reading the newspaper without the specs and with case. He felt greatly moved and thankful by getting this causeless grace of Baba and the miraculous healing touch of
his finger. 

The statement of the doctors that without god’s Grace his left eye cannot be cured proved true to every letter. While standing these experiences, both husband and wife were full of emotions and tears were rolling down their eyes.
