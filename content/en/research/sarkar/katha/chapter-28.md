It was the 12th month of my leave, yet there was no response to my appeal.

While in the village in the fourth week of December 1955, I decided that I would extend my leave no further and shall send my resignation. 

I decided this mentally and did not tell this to any member of my family. I thought that I should inform my family after my resignation was accepted.

My leave finished on 6 January 1956. I decided to resign thereafter. 

On the fourth day of taking this decision I received an inland letter. I could not guess who had sent it but when I opened it I found that it was from Baba. The letter was in English. 

Today that letter is not with me but I remember fully its language. I shall try to reproduce it here.

{{< b >}}
Your decision of resignation is premature. You must join your duty urgently and I will give you everything. In case you fail to reconcile in joining to your present post, you take it as my order and must report for duty immediately.
{{< /b >}}


I was surprised to note that Baba had written the letter the same day as I had mentally resolved that I would extend my leave no longer and will resign from service.

Now there was no other course open for me and when my leave was over on the 6 January 1956 I rejoined my duty.

Great is the liila of omniscient Baba and wonderful are his methods of doing favour. Sitting in a village hundreds of miles away I mentally decide something and Baba reflects it then and there. This added one more link to the chain of my faith. Thus
1955 was over with the Grace of Baba.

Following the instructions of Baba I rejoined my duty immediately on the expiry of my leave. However the whole of 1956 and 1957 up to August was a period of great turmoil for me. During this brief period of one year and eight months I was transferred to seven places. My wife was not keeping good health these days. I had to look after four children. I had to run after the doctors all the time. As there was no other convenient place, the family had to be kept with me.

Those who have experience of government service and frequent transfers will be able to understand my plight very well. In spite of these troubles Baba’s grace was always with me. Whenever I had to go for however a small period, I got good name and reputation though Baba’s grace. Strange was that period, on the one hand the difficult problems of service, the rising and unassailable mountains of economic and psychological problems and on the other hand good name fame and reputation Great is the Liila of Baba.


## Posted To Muzzafarpur

After resuming work in Patna on January 7, 1956, I was posted to Muzaffarpur which I liked.

I assumed my duties at Muzaffarpur on 17 January 1956. After I became somewhat free from official work I came to know that my childhood friends Acarya Vishwanathji was also there. I therefore went to see him. From him I came to know that Acarya Shri Kishanji and Shri Prem Bahadur Mathur were also there. I was also informed that the Dharma Cakra was held in the bungalow of Shri Prem Bahadurji. In the Dharma Cakra I got the opportunity to meet all the Margiis brothers. Here I came to know that on the New Years' eve Baba’s vanii had come which was like this:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The long neglected humanity has awakened today. This awakening of theirs will usher in a new chapter in human history. You are the first messengers of that still to arrive tradition

Anandamurti 1.1.1956
{{< /l >}}


In those days, civilized society looked down on those who believed in the divinity of human
beings and wanted to lead a spiritual life. 

Their indifference became intolerable to Baba
and He indicated to His disciples through this blissful message that the divinity of
humanity is now fully bestirred. This will certainly open a new chapter in the history of
human progress and those who have tried to follow his path will certainly be regarded
as the harbingers of that new Age. 

I this found great significance in the vanii of Baba.
In such period I received a letter from my younger brother Radhakantji that the
basis of his faith had completely been broke after hearing all about Ananda Marga
philosophy and he had not yet got any new faith. He started feeling emptiness in his
daily routine of life and wanted to take initiation as early as possible. 

He was these
days posted at Siwan and there was no acarya either there or near about. I informed
him through letter that he should come to Muzaffarpur, where arrangements will be
made for his initiation.

Muzaffarpur at that time was most fortunate through Baba’s grace. There were
many acaryas here. On receipt of my letter he came to me at about eight in the night
and wanted to return within the next two hours. He had little time and I could hardly
manage to get into contact with an acarya in that short period. Therefore I had to give
him initiation. This was the second occasion for me to initiate anyone. My first
opportunity was to my mother.

Now after office work I had only two functions. First to run about for doctors and
second Marga work.

Salutation to BABA the Lord of the Gods and the Supreme
Divine

PATNA DMC 1956
Thus while in Muzaffarpur, in the minds of Margii brothers, my own troubled
personal life had an easy flow. Those days pracar was going strong throughout Bihar.
Those in Patna were doing Marga work with great sincerity and speed. Many
individuals came within the fold of the Marga.

DMC was arranged in Patna.

Baba was to arrive on the full-moon day of the month of Chaitra on Jamal Road in Patna. 

Everyone in the state of Bihar was informed about the arrival time of Baba and the place and timing of the DMC. 

The Margiis of Muzaffarpur also received this information. All were happy and began to plan going to Patna.

I was in two minds on account of my domestic troubles whether I should go or not. 

Meanwhile the acaryaji from Patna told me by telephone that I must attend. I was
already desirous of going to Patna.

The Instructions from this acarya strengthened my resolve and I surrendered all my domestic works at the lotus feet of Baba and started for Patna. There I had the good fortune of having Baba darshan and also had the good luck to do my sastaunga pranam at His feet. Baba enquired about my family with great affection and I was overwhelmed with gratitude.

I was so much overwhelmed with emotion that time that I could not utter a word.

Then I recalled that a big crowd of persons desirous of Baba’s darshan was waiting outside. Therefore unwillingly I began to control my desire to remain at His lotus feet and again did my sastaunga pranam and went out of the room. 

I later was again able to have the darshan of His Lotus Feet and began to enjoy the subtle vibrations of spiritual waves.

The whole day was spent in these vibrations. In the evening, again I had the Baba’s darshan at the time of the DMC. Baba looked divine and superb during the DMC. He was irresistibly attractive, justifying those lines of the great poet, Tulsidas: 

“Do see, He is worth seeing”.

I continued to lose myself in this divine sight. The subject of the discourse was “Bliss and Pleasure”. The subject was extremely good and easy to understand. 

The devotees were drinking His nectar-like words from their ears and drinking His divine beauty with their eyes at the same time. Blessed was that hour of the DMC.
