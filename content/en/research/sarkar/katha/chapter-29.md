Thus time continued to pass taking worldly pain and spiritual bliss in its stride and the expansion of Marga activities continued. We started thinking of calling Baba to Muzaffarpur. 

So far DMC had taken place in Jamalpur, Monghyr, Bhagalpur and Patna only. Thus 1956 came to an end and 1957 began. We celebrated the New Year. 

Baba’s Vanii for the occasion was like this:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Those who have collected by taking the resolve of marching together the obstacles of the path cannot obstruct them. Those who are planning to conquer the world and marching to the tune of victory, their speed cannot be marred by the suspicious sight of cowardish thoughts. 

Oh human beings, you advance forward. Your only language should be the speed towards progress.”
Anandamurti 1.1.1957
{{< /l >}}


Baba encouraged the sadhakas by this powerful message and we were reminded of ‘Samgachhadhvam....’ mantra. This mantra is not only to be recited before the dharmacakra, but it will have to be put in to action with all sincerity.

Although the path may be full of thorns, but sadhakas who resolve to march together – will not be obstructed by these difficulties. When a sadhaka attains perfection he sees the whole world like a small fruit in the palm of His hand.

The sadhana of Ananda Marga is a sadhana to conquer the world and every sadhaka has to advance merrily singing and playing the tune of victory. Suspicions weaken the mind and such people will see thing in pessimistic way but no one can stop the attainment of progress. 

Baba has not only warned the sadhakas but the whole mankind that they should march shed with the song of victory in their lips. Baba’s encouraging message was most timely. As many selfish, unprincipled, so-called leaders had started viewing the progress of Ananda Marga with suspicion.


### Muzaffarpur DMC 1957 And My Promotion

On January 1, 1957, all the Margiis of Muzzafarpur decided that Baba should come there to conduct DMC. 

<!-- Our request was dispatched to Baba through a special messenger and we were waiting anxiously for Baba to send His acceptance of our request.
rd -->

Meanwhile on 3 January 1957, I was informed by phone from the office of my departmental head in Patna, that I had been promoted and that I have been posted in the head office at Danapur.

I received this information on the same day and almost at the same time that two years before on January 3, 1955, I had received the information of my demotion. 

I was relieved of my duty on 7 January 1957 to join my new post in the head office. Baba thus completed two years of my eventful career.

As this was going Baba’s acceptance for DMC at Muzaffarpur also arrived. The time for DMC and Baba’s arrival was between  January 27, 1957 to January 29. 

On the January 15, I was to take over my new post in the head office and I was sorry that Iwould not be able to devote time for the preparation of the DMC. 

At that time the most prominent workers at Muzaffarpur were Acarya Kishanji, Acarya Prem Bahadurji, Acarya Vishwanathji Sakaldeoji, Gaunga Sharanji and such other respected persons. I consulted them all and I was allowed to join duties on 
January 15, 1957 and asked to come to Muzaffarpur a day earlier than the DMC.

I left my family at Muzaffarpur went and joined my duties on 15 January and returned to Muzaffarpur on the night of the 25 January and engaged myself in the work of helping to organise the DMC.

Baba arrived by train. There was a big welcoming crowd of Margii brothers and sisters at the railway station. As the train steamed in the whole atmosphere vibrated with the sound of ‘Ananda Marga Amar Hey’ (‘Ananda Marga is Immortal’) and ‘Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji ki Jai’. 

Every Margii was caught by a wonderful wave. Someone was weeping another was vibrating with songs and some one lost all awareness of the body.

Among those who had come was Bindeshwariji who was dancing with great devotion, and singing. While dancing he lost all consciousness of his body Shrii Ram Khelavanji and other members of his family were looking after him. 

No-one remained untouched by these devotional vibrations. I was standing in one corner looking at all the devotees.

Arrangements had ben made for Baba to stay in the bungalow of Acarya Prem Bahadur Mathur. Therefore he and Acarya Kishanji took Baba in his car to the house. The rest of the devotees started walking towards this house dancing and singing with devotion. They looked like the waves of the ocean rolling towards the shore.

I had the responsibility to take those devotees from Jamalpur who had come with Baba to the place where they were to stay in my car.

The then General Secretary of the Marga, Shri P.K. Chatterjee, had also come along with Baba. I told him that I wanted to take Baba to my residence for some time. Though it would mean some trouble for Baba, but my house would be purified by His presence and my family would feel blessed. He said that he would certainly put my request before Baba. He did so and then called me in.


### Baba Visits My House

My request to Baba to visit my house was supported by the General Secretary. 

<!-- He was to come by noon and I was ready with a car in advance. Baba came out at the fixed time and sat in the car, and I drove Baba
to my residence. -->

Every member of my family and myself got the opportunity to do our sastaunga pranam before Baba. I was so flooded with emotion due to the immense pleasure, that tears began to flow from my eyes and my voice was choked. I placed some fruits and sweets before Baba but He was not prepared to eat anything. 

My wife was standing with a glass of water in her hands. With great persistence, I took one rasgulla up to His mouth. 

Baba took a very small bite and we were all highly pleased. Then Baba said, “Enough”, and took the glass of water from my wife’s hand. The rest of the fruits and sweets we ate as prasad.

Baba sat for sometime and talked with the children and then got ready to leave. All of us did our sastaunga pranam again and then I took Him to the residence ofGaunga Sharanji which was close by. 

Shrii Gaunga Sharanji was standing ready to welcome Baba. He took Baba to his drawing room. Baba stayed there for sometime and then left for Prem Bahadurji’s bungalow. While returning from Gaunga Sharanji’s house I asked Baba why non-Margiis were not allowed in the DMC.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
If some non-Margii would have an evil thought in the DMC about me, nature rebounds this immediately even without my wishing it, and he might be harmed. This is why non-Margiis are not allowed in DMC.” 
{{< /l >}}


Baba gave general darshan at the residence of Shrii Mathur and the DMC was arranged in the house of Acarya Kishanji. 

This house belonged to a rich man and was in the style of a ‘haveli’, having a big courtyard and verandah. 

DMC was held in the courtyard. It was completely full of devotees.

Many disciple brothers arrived from neighbouring areas on the day of the DMC, so the number was large. 

Before Baba arrived, the whole courtyard and the verandas were over-full. There was not a space vacant.

The organisers of Muzaffarpur did not know that there were so many disciples in that area. The courtyard and verandas were as if converted into the “Pushpak Viman” (a house of flowers), by Baba, where the accommodation became sufficient for all those who came. Everyone who came got a place to sit.

A beautiful platform was raised for Baba’s seat. The Lord of the hearts of the devotees, most worshipful Baba, arrived in the DMC and cries of "Victory to Baba" rent the air as the devotees welcomed Him. Baba who is bliss Himself took his seat.

Shrii Kishanji and Sakaldeoji offered their garlands to Baba and one of the devotees began to sing a welcome song.

As soon as Baba entered, the whole atmosphere became electrified.

Someone was vibrating and his limbs were trembling and others were looking at Him with unblinking eyes.

Someone was crying, “Baba’ Baba”, someone else was unconsciously roaring “hum” and yet another seemed to be dancing even whilst sitting.

Everyone was carried away with emotion. Such was the vibration that none remained unaffected and everyone began to float in this devotional ocean. The devotee who was singing, began to weep and his throat began to choke, so he stopped.

Another devotee with another song made an effort to sing another welcome song, but on account of the flow of tears, he also could not complete his song as his voice also began to tremble.

<!-- Baba’s splendour as He sat on the platform was matchless. It is not possible to
record that wonderful and glorious sight. The slightly pinkish colour on his white
complexion was fascinating. This arrested everyone’s attention almost unknowingly. -->

The subject of discourse of DMC was ‘Vyapti ka Aeshvarya’ - 'The Glory of the All-pervasive’. Everyone was listening to Baba with rapt attention only broken by the occasional emotional cry of “Baba, Baba”, from some devotee.

After the discourse was over we did guru puja together and many people had the good fortune of personal contact with Baba. There was one specialty about this DMC. The old father of Acaryai Vindhyachal Panday expressed a desire to see Baba and touch His feet. 

He was not only very old but also very week due to illness and he could not walk without support. Acarya Vindhyachalji brought his father in the DMC with the assistance of two people and he got the opportunity both of Baba’s darshan and of touching his feet and was extremely gratified.

On the 29 January 1957, Baba left for Jamalpur, looking at the crowd of devotees in Muzaffarpur DMC. Now Ananda Marga was taking a bigger and bigger shape and the pracar work was progressing most satisfactorily. It was growing by leaps and bounds.

<!-- I became acquainted with many new Margii brothers during the DMC, From Jamalpur Shrii Bindeshwariji had come along with other devotees. After the DMC, he kindly agreed to spend one night with me. Similarly Shri Ram Khelavanji of Jamalpur stayed with me along with members of his family. 

While I was in Jamalpur this family had not been initiated so this was my first contact with them. Every member of this family whether young or old had immense devotion for Baba. Shri Ram Khelavanji himself is a person of extremely simple nature and of pleasant temperament and all his children have inherited these qualities in full measure. All are exemplars of devotion and service.

These days Bindeshwariji was mostly in an abnormal state, but every member of Ram Khelavanji's family always served him wholeheartedly and even today they look after him. Every member of Ram Khelavanji's family has not only a spiritual relationship with Baba but they also consider themselves to be His children. 

Baba also responds to these relationships with equal love. After more than twenty-five years, these relationships have flowered into great devotional expressions. Blessed is the family of Ram Khelavanji .All his daughters are like Miiras of this age. -->
