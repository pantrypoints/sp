I felt very much the absence of Margii company in Danapur, so I made efforts for pracar, but there was hardly any success. However it was whilst in Danapur that Shri Gaunga Sharanji informed me that one of my classmates, Shrii Sashi Rainjan
Prasadji, had also taken initiation. He is one of the pillars of Marga and very good sadhaka now.

The time for Vaeshakhii Purnima was drawing near. We were anxiously waiting for Baba’s vanii for the occasion. Finally that day came and the following vanii was read out to us:


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" c="Vaeshakhii Purnima 1957" >}}
The meaning of Dharma Sadhana is that every person – every object of this universe is to be seen as Infinite. The aim of Dharma is not to destroy unity by groupism. 

But those who have vested interest are living on the basis of the basic weaknesses of human mind and therefore support distinctions and divisions. 

These people become alarmed when they observe the speed of Dharma and they take recourse to criticism, wrong propaganda, false stories etc. and prove their intemperance by using all the weapons of immortality. Good men
will not stop by this. 

They will have to move forward. They should remember that the path of truth is strewn with obstacles and the struggle against these obstacles is sadhana.

This message of the world-teacher Baba came at a time when society and its rules were breaking fast. Political leaders were divided different parties and all were victims of party politics. 

Human values were dying and the leaders had forgotten the service of society and were indulging in selfish pursuits. They not only suspected the motives of spiritual-minded Margiis, but were spreading different kinds of propaganda against them. At such a difficult time, Baba gave the clarion call to his devotees to move towards spirituality with faith and firmness.

Sadhana is nothing else but struggle or fight, and righteousness demands that all the obstructions should be overcome boldly to march towards our desideratum. Dharma sadhana does not mean that people should attain salvation and disappear but it really means that every person and every object of this universe is to be seen as a part of infinity. In the words of saint Tulsidas, one will have to see Ram and Siita in every particle of this universe.

I was hardly in Danapur for about six months when I was sent for further training to Delhi. Perhaps Baba did not want me to be stable at any one place as yet, so once more I had to send my wife and children to our village home before I went to Delhi.

In Delhi by Baba’s grace I got the company of two Margiis; one was Shrii R.
Prasad and the other one was Shrii Jitendra Tyagi. 

Shri R. Prasad was my ultimate superior in the department and his life was
very, very busy. It was, therefore possible to meet him only now and then. 

Shri R. Prasad and Tyagiji were very close friends. I was meeting Shri Jitendra Tyagii more
frequently as his businesses were then closed and he stayed mostly in Delhi and used
to come to meet me often. 

It was really Tyagiji who had brought Shri R. Prasadji into the Marga, therefore it was through him that I used to get information about Prasadji. 
Both the friends had one specialty, which is rarely found amongst sadhakas in the
earlier part of their sadhana; both had implicitly faith and great devotion towards Baba.

I found both of them firm and unmoving in the midst of the most difficult circumstances.

Shrii Jitendra Tyagi is so interesting, touching and moving that before I relate his
experiences I must introduce him to the readers. Later I will tell more about Shri R.
Prasad.

Tyagiji was resident of rural area in Muradabad district of Uttar Pradesh. His family was rich and he had a very luxurious and pampered childhood. His high school and college careers were spent in naughty and youthful activities when young. He earned hundreds of thousands of rupees and and lost hundreds of thousands, but was never bothered about it. He had a peerless carefree and easy attitude towards life. He was fond of good food and good friends and hence his expenditures were heavy. He was so liberal with friendship that whenever in the midst of his friends, no one else dare open his purse for anything. Most of his friends were wealthy aristocratic people and his life was full of sophistication. He was a very straightforward, frank and emotional person.

I first met him in 1947 and since then we had become friends. He took initiation
in 1955 and started doing meditation. More than regularity in sadhana, he got attached
with Baba. In 1956 after Ananda Purnima, there was a marriage in his family and it was
essential for him to be present at that function, so he started soon after DMC was over.
His train was about to leave and so he left in a hurry without taking his food.
That night Baba also did not take his food, although the General Secretary requested
Baba many a time.

Baba said, “One of my sons has left without taking his food and it would not be
proper if I take eat.”

As it was a girl who was to be married, her family was paying for the marriage
and its expenses. Tyagiji was carrying a big amount of cash with him in a trunk. He
also had a bag containing his ticket and some cash for expenses on the way.
When the train reached Lucknow station Tyagiji discovered that his brother-in-
law was on the platform in front of the next compartment, and then he started moving
along the platform towards the engine in search of someone. Tyagiji followed him, and
he had gone a little distance when someone patted him on the shoulder and said,
“Look for your luggage.” He looked back but could not see anyone he knew and
therefore continued to go ahead.

Meanwhile he heard a well-known voice in his ear asking, “Where are you
going? Go back to your compartment and look for your luggage”.
This time the sound was like an order and he immediately recognised that it
was the voice of Baba. He returned immediately. 

And as he was walking, he saw the
luggage on the head of a coolie. The coolie was carrying his trunk and his bag and was
about to get down on the platform, when he caught hold of him. After this, in his owncarefree manner he told the man, “Good man, you are taking away everything.


Something you should have left for me also! At least you could have left me the ticket
and some money for my expenses on the way!”

The porter was struck dumb and stared at him with the luggage still on his
head. On enquiry, it was discovered that the porter had lifted this luggage mistaking it
for that of Tyagiji’s companion in the first class compartment in which they were
travelling. That gentleman had already gone ahead, but now by Baba’s grace Tyagiji
got his luggage back.

After relating the incident Tyagiji said seriously, “Look how much care Baba
takes of us. If he had not instructed me, I would never have got my luggage back.
However foolishly we may act, Baba always keeps an eye on us.”

Then he related another incident of his life which was even more significant.
He had been doing business in Calcutta and one day he fell ill. The illness
lingered on so he went to the most famous and prominent doctor of Calcutta, Dr.
Bidhan Chandra Roy. 

The doctor examined him thoroughly and declared that he was
suffering from TB. When Tyagiji did not believe this, he was screened and X-rayed and
it was discovered that the illness had already become old and therefore, in addition to
medicines the doctor insisted on complete rest. It was a big punishment for him to lie in
bed night and day. He had hardly rested for three or four days when he began to feel
bored and one day he silently got up and went to Jamalpur, reaching Baba’s residence
in the morning.

Tyagiji did sastaunga pranam to Baba and sat at His feet on the floor. When
Baba asked after his health, he told him about his illness. The biggest difficulty was that
he could not spend the day in bed doing nothing but taking doses of medicines. Baba
explained to him that he should follow doctor’s advice and take the medicines
prescribed and that alone would cure him.
*
But Tyagiji was not prepared to accept this course, and began to tell Baba
again and again that he did not want to prolong life by lying on the bed and taking
medicines. He held fast to Baba’s feet and refused to let go.

Now Baba took pity on him and with the toe of his right foot touched those
places in the chest where patches had formed in the lungs and said, “It is here that
these patches have formed. Go now you need not take any medicine and lead normal
life.”

Tyagiji was very happy and again did sastaunga to Baba and returned to Calcutta. There he went to Dr. Bidhan Chandra Ray’s surgery. As soon as the doctor saw him he asked him whether he had been taking rest. 

Tyagiji said, ‘Why should I take rest? I am quite normal”. The doctor did not believe this of course and took him to his clinic where he again X-rayed and ran all the tests. When he saw these reports the doctor was wonder- struck. 

There was no trace of the disease at all. The doctor did not believe that a disease like TB could be cured in such a brief period, and so asked Tyagiji in confidence what had really happened, and Tyagiji told him about the touch and blessings from Baba.

The doctor fell silent and became thoughtful.Finally he told Tyagiji, “The doctor and the medicine are nothing as compared to the grace of the guru. Now you should take your guru’s advice as gospel truth and follow it sincerely in action and try that you continue to get your guru’s grace all your
life. Blessed are you and your guruji.”

Tyagiji is now no longer with us but his fathomless devotion and firm faith in
Baba are worth emulating.
