At the time when this message was given by Baba some so-called leaders of the traditional society, saw the increasing influence of the Marga damage their vested interests. 

They began to loudly proclaiming the general public that a group engaged in spiritual pursuits, should have nothing to do with social or political side of life. 

Their view was that spiritual practice was an individual’s private concerns and it should have nothing to do with social or political side of life. 

Their view was that spiritual practice was an individual’s private concern and it should have nothing to do with social life. 

By such logic, they were trying to mislead the public.

Even those amongst us who were in favour of (so-called) peaceful existence were influenced by their arguments to some extent. But such evil propaganda had just the reverse results. 

Such anti-propaganda aroused a curiosity in the minds of people about knowing more about the Marga. 

When they met experienced Margiis in this regard, they were usually influenced by our great philosophy and ideals and as a result adopted our ideology.

Whatever little indifference it brought amongst a section of Margiis, in my view Baba’s New Year message was addressed to them. 

On receipt of this message, every Margii became fully alert, reassessed his field of activity and plunged with added vigour into the work of the spread of the mission.

This message also silenced the opposition. Sadhakas who were well established in the lofty ideals and philosophy of he Marga, began to flow like fountains with firmness and spread, removing the pebbles of their life was not like a stagnant pool and peace does not mean the peace of a burial ground.


### Baba Introduces Renaissance Universal: New Year’S Dmc In Bhagalpur 1958

In January it was know that in Trimuhan in Bhagalpur district, DMC would be held. 

Although I had a strong desire to attend the DMC and was anxious to have Baba’s darshan due to adverse circumstances, I could not attend the DMC. This was my misfortune. 

On January 26 1958 at Trimuhan in Bhagalpur district, Baba inaugurated the first meeting of the Renaissance Club, during the meeting of the youth there.

In the meanwhile Shrii Deep Narayanji was transferred in the area of my official jurisdiction and with him I reached Jamalpur in the midst of the month of February old memories of Jamalpur. Revived. I stayed there for two days.

Every day morning and evening I would have Baba's darshan, offer Him my pranam and hear His discoursed. Is and had the good fortune to sit for hours at His feet in the field. I was not at all willing to leave Jamalpur. But Baba’s will is Supreme. I had to come back.


### My Mother Falls Gravely Ill

It was not ordained that I should live at peace anywhere. My younger brother is
a police officer and he had gone to our village in the middle of 1958 on leave. He
informed me from there that my revered mother had a stroke and was unconscious for
more than 24 hours. 

I was very much disturbed on receiving these tidings. I thought that in the absence of any good doctor or hospital in the village, mother might not begetting good treatment and everyone at home would be in a state of great distress. I
prayed for Baba’s help.

Remembering Baba I set out to perform my duties in good earnest. Every
moment I would remember Baba and get due assistance and fulfilment of my
requirements. His grace is unending. I immediately took a good doctor with me and
took him to my village in a jeep. The doctor also felt disturbed after seeing my mother’s
condition and told me that he is using the best available injections and medicines, but
there was little hope of her recovery.

I told the doctor that he should start the treatment in the name of God and I also
sat down to pray to Baba for the health of my mother. The doctor kept awake for the
whole night and treated my mother but there was no sign of relief. In the morning the
doctor returned to Hajipur leaving instructions that the patient should be given full rest
until she revives She should not be allowed to move from bed.

I went to Mahua with the doctor where another doctor used to live. I brought him
and one nurse along with me. This second doctor was also quite worried after seeing
my mother’s condition, but by Baba’s grace this one had more courage than the former
doctor. He advised that my mother would suffer and might expire in the absence of
proper treatment and a doctor in the village. He would also not be able to come often
during the day. Mahua was eight miles away. 

According to the doctor she would need a
nurse for proper functioning of her bladder and bowels, and no nurse was available in
the village. Therefore, she would have to be taken to a town. After giving his initial
treatment the doctor advised that she should be taken to Hajipur. I told that my car has
been taken away to Hajipur by the first doctor, and unless that vehicle returns she
cannot be taken to Hajipur as there are no jeeps around which can even be borrowed
for the purpose. I became quite worried, and began to pray to Baba for help.

By Baba’s grace, the doctor agreed to take mother to my Hajipur residence in
his jeep. As the road was of gravel, there was no alternative to a jeep. Therefore, as
per instructions of the doctor the back of the jeep was prepared as a bed for her by
filling the space between the two seats with cotton mattresses. Mother was then laid
upon the cotton mattresses and my aunt and the nurse sat by her side and another
family attendant sat on author side. Mother’s body was lifted with great care
remembering Baba at every moment and placed in the jeep like a dead body. Everyone
felt distressed at this sight.

Now the doctor himself took the driver’s seat and drove the jeep at very slow
speed to Hajipur. I sat by the doctor’s side and with one hand at the back continued to
server my mother’s body and all the time I continued to use Guru Mantra and all
powerful Baba’s name for restoration of the health of my mother.

Thus remembering Baba all the way every moment we reached Hajipur at
about eight in the night. There, we faced another problem. My house was on the upper
story. So the problem was how to take Mother upstairs. At the doctor’s suggestion a
stretcher was obtained from Hajipur Hospital and mother’s body was laid upon it like a
corpse and all the time remembering Baba she was taken upstairs and laid on the bed
there,

Thereafter, the doctor who had gone to the village with me was called. He did
not like the act of bringing mother to Hajipur from the village Still I requested him to
begin the treatment in the name of the Almighty, I told him that god was not so unkind
as to snatch away my mother from me in this condition. The doctor began his treatment
and when he began to leave I requested him kindly to look upon my mother morning
and evening invariably without being sent for.Now, I began to bid farewell to the doctor and nurse from Mahua with my expression of gratitude.

But they refused to accept any fee. With great difficulty they
were persuaded to fill their gas tank at my expense. Thus I got Baba’s assistance at
every step and I spent the whole night remembering him. Thus prayers to Baba and the
doctor’s treatment continued. For one week my mother lay unconscious. By Baba’s
grace, she opened her eyes after one week for the first time and she looked very
frightened. She felt very frightened looking at everything it was very difficult for her to
look even at the fan on the ceiling. Most of the time she looked very much afraid.

Baba gives us many difficult tests, and I appealed to Him, “Oh compassionate
Baba let me get through this difficult test, and let my mother regain her health”.
By now about eleven or twelve doctors had seen my mother separately, and it
was decided to set up a Board of Competent Doctors to decide the line of treatment to
follow. Thus every week these doctors began to meet as a Board.

One doctor whom I had taken to the village would execute the decisions of the
Board. Even after this there was no improvement in the conditions of my mother.
