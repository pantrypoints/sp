I wrote a letter to Baba in great sorrow and helplessness and prayed in this letter that I did want my mother to leave this world in her present state of fear and asked Him He to kindly grant her more life. There was one more factor. 

Both my brother and I were in service and my uncle and my father had expired any therefore it appeared that if mother did not survive the house and the property in the village would be ruined. After a long time I realized that it was mere illusion of mine. By now my younger brother and his wife had picked up its management with full responsibility.

In the mean time the treatment continued. But there was not improvement in the condition of my mother. I continued to wait for blessings from Baba in the form of his reply to my letter. After writing the letter to Baba, I used to open my mail myself. But when no letter was received from Baba I felt depressed.

Meanwhile one day my mother’s condition deteriorated seriously and she was in dangerous condition. The doctors advised that it would be her last night. 

Now there was no hope of her survival. These disappointing observations of the doctors made me
still more helpless. But instead of losing faith and courage, I began to pray still more
ardently to Baba to save the life of my mother. My mother was very brave and would
humble the loftiest characters in her life and she could not die in this frightful condition.
Now my prayer began to take the shape of insistence. That night I set on the
left side of her pillow and began to pray to Baba for giving her vital energy.

That night I did not take rest or leave my mother even for a moment. At about two in the morning I felt sleepy and had an impression as if the earth was being dug to bury my mother. I began to perspire and at that very moment my mother caught hold of my hand with her left hand and began to try to make me understand something. But except for indistinct sounds , she could notsay anything as her right side was paralysed from top to bottom.

I woke up and for a moment lost my balance and patience. But soon
remembering Baba I started giving courage to my mother. Unwittingly it came out from
my mouth that the evil and inauspicious moment had passed and now there was no
cause for worry. Everything would be all right soon.Somehow serving my mother and remembering Baba every moment that night
passed and I called the doctor again in the morning. He again examined my mother
and said that it appeared that she had to survive for a few more days. Meanwhile I was
most anxiously waiting for Baba’s reply to my letter. Finally on the 29th April 1958 I
received Baba’s letter. He had heard my prayers. The letter reads like this:
Jamalpur, 26-4-58

“Blessed Nagina,

Received your letter. This illness is not going to be cured. Do you want her to prolong in this pitiable condition? Be what may, Nature will act as per your desire. May good happen to you.

Eternal well-wisher
Yours
Anandamurti”


<!-- Salutations to Baba Who Showers all Success and Well Being
Reading this letter from Baba my disturbed mind got some solace and as per
Baba’s instructions.  -->

I began to pray to Mother Nature for the restoration of health to my mother. But repeated prayers of this nature also brought no improvement in her condition. By now all doctors of Hajipur had developed an aversion to seeing my mother; as they had tried all their medicines and were at a loss to think as to what more they could do.

These doctors now advised that I should take my mother to Patna. This idea did not appeal to me. I had spent quite a lot on doctors so far and now I began to feel the pinch on this side also. Taking her to Patna would mean big expenses.

Some of my brother Margiis read Baba’s letter to me dated 26th April 1958 and said that this letter means almost blank cheque for you on nature. I again wrote to Baba that nature was not conceding my request, therefore I requested him to adopt my desire as his and order nature to restore health to my mother. Mother Nature was not even listening to me far from favouring me with fulfillment of my desire.


### Baba Sends A Doctor Who Cures My Mother

Exactly 2 days after my posting this letter, one of the Inspectors working
under me brought a homeopathic doctor to my office. This doctor had himself desired
to see my mother, so the Inspector brought him along. 

The doctor was most
unimpressive in his talk and behaviour. Still as he had come just for the sake of
courtesy and almost unwillingly told the Inspector that you will take the doctor to my
mother. I was to follow shortly.

The doctor examined my mother’s condition and began to ask many questions as per homeopathic principles. As my mother could not speak, my aunt was replying most of the questions. 

There were some questions whose replies my aunt could not answer. Many of his questions looked to my only for the sake of creating impressions on others.

I felt somewhat exasperated as to who has brought this man here. Anyway he gave a small packet of medicine to my aunt and asked her to give it to my mother. 

He further instructed that if there was any variation in the condition of the patient, he
should be informed accordingly. My aunt administered the medicine to mother in the presence of the doctor himself. 

I observed the condition of the mother for one hour, but there was no change. 

I sent word through the inspector that there was no change in mother’s condition. He came with another medicine and administered it to my mother and himself, sat by her side to observe her condition. I also sat with him.

About half an hour later there was some increase in the speed of her breath.

It appeared that her ailment increased somewhat. The doctor felt happy at this and said
that his medicine had started working. He said he would make her walk by the ninth
day. To me his statement appeared as that of a madman. My mother was confined to
bed and paralysed.

Particularly the right side of her body was totally paralysed. In this
context the talk of making her walk on the ninth day appeared too much to be believed.
That day he did not administer any other medicine. When he left I offered him
his fee, but he refused to accept it. He said he would charge only once in a day,
irrespective of the number of visits. As I have already charged once, I shall charge no
more today.

I told him that other doctors used to come three or four times a day and
therefore.

He should also come at least thrice in the day. It would be unreasonable if
you come thrice but charge for only one visit, buy he did not agree to my suggestion.


He said that I should send information about the condition of the patient and he would
send the medicine. There would be no need for his repeated visits.

The doctor was a Muslim and a firm moralist. 

He was such a strict follower of
his faith that he used to say the Muslim prayers or ‘namaz’ five times a day. I told him
that the patient needs psychological treatment also apart from the medicines. A patient who was visited by doctors five times a day might feel that she is being neglected if no doctor came to see her on certain days.

This argument of mine appealed to the doctor and with great difficulty, he agreed to visit twice, morning and evening, to see my mother. Even so he would charge for only a single visit. He said that he would come in the morning to see the
patient and charge his fees for the same. In the evening he goes to the mosque for his
prayers and on his way back he would also look in on my mother.

I again requested him to see the matter from the psychological point of view
that the patient who was getting an injection or pill so often during the day may feel
disappointed if the frequency is reduced, therefore, you may also have to give her
some blank doses. The doctor considered blank doses as basically wrong, but I
persuaded him that it would only be wrong if you charge the price for the same.
Baba did not reply to my second letter, but from the next day after I wrote that
letter the treatment of this homeopathic doctor started. I realized that Baba had
specially arranged this doctor taking pity on me.

The doctor told me that he was grateful that his misunderstanding about blank
doses was removed. He also said that along with the treatment he would also pray for
the good health of my mother every day.

In just two days there was miraculous improvement in my mother’s condition.

<!-- All this happened when I wrote to Baba to convert my desire into an order for nature to
cure my mother.  -->

Baba answered my prayer in the form of sending a saintly doctor for her treatment. For about five days the doctor gave her one dose every day, and thereafter he started giving only two doses in a week. Due to Baba’s grace on the fifthday we began to make mother sit up in bed with the supports of pillows. Now her voice also began to get somewhat clear.

Exactly on the ninth day mother insisted that she wanted to walk. She told the
doctor in her faltering tone that she wanted to walk. The doctor asked me to support
her to take a few steps.

We obeyed the doctor, and remembering Baba we helped mother walk.
Now she did not like lying on the bed but wanted to sit for some time. We,
therefore, placed a big Victoria chair in her room whereon she used to sit, Now, she
was taking only one does of medicine is a week and then it was reduced to one dose in
fifteen days. Thus reducing the dose gradually, the doctor came to giving only one
does in a year. 

Within 15 days, through Baba grace, mother began to walk without any support, and her voice also improved about fifty percent. Since she fell ill only my aunt used to feed her with her own hands.

Meanwhile May arrived and the time for Vaeshakhii Purnima DMC. We began
to wait for the message from Baba. This time Baba’s message read like this:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
At this juncture of the junction of 2 civilizations, the most important thing is the virtuous life of the individual. We shall have to be alert every moment so that in the darkness of petty selfishness this human treasure is not lost. 

If virtue cannot be saved, civilization also cannot be saved. As a consequence the long penance of the human race will go in vain. That learning which could not be practiced in real life is only bookish knowledge and it is worthless.
