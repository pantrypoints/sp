Meanwhile, September arrived. 

From the programme sent by the ashram manager, I came to know that Baba had kindly agreed to hold DMC in West
Champaran on September 26, 1958.

In those days Baba was kind enough to hold DMC every month somewhere or other. Most of us could participate in all the DMCs. The great devotee, Ac. Deep Narainji, suggested that we should attend this DMC. I was also desirous of going and listening to Baba’s discourse. Now we decided to go together on the 25th from Hajipur at the appointed time.

Remembering Baba, we started on our journey to Ramnagar. We had to change the train at Muzaffarpur. There at the station we met a large number of Margii brothers. Here we came to know that Baba was also leaving for Ramnagar by the
same train. Now our joy knew no bounds.

When Baba's train arrived, all of us boarded the train in the midst ofcries of ‘Victory to most Baba’. At Muzaffarpur station we had the good luck to have a darshan of Baba.

By morning our train reached Harinagar station. Here in the early hours of the morning we again had the good fortune to have Baba's darshan. Baba left the train here and was taken by car to Ramnagar, which was about half a mole away. While
disembarking at Harinagar station, Deep Narainji began to sing loudly a devotional
song. Bindeshwariji also joined him. 

He used to be in ecstasy most of the time. 

The words of the song were: "A saint has arrived on earth to spread the cult of asceticism."

These 2 gentlemen were leading and singing while the rest of the Margiis
were following silently. By Baba’s grace some other citizens also began to walk with us
out of curiosity.

Thus we began to form a processing automatically. This procession reached Ramnagar High School where arrangements had been made for the lodging of the Margiis.

Baba so graced this procession that the people of Ramnagar liked it very much.

Ananda Marga became popular there immediately. Consequently in the evening a large crowd gathered for the DMC, consisting of Margiis as well as non–Margiis. The Margiis tried to persuade a lot, but the non-Margiis insisted on attending the DMC,
Baba was informed about, this situation, He kindly agreed that all may be allowed to
join peacefully. That was only the second time such permission was given. The first
such concession was allowed at Amra DMC.

When Baba arrived at the DMC, he was greeted with slogans of “Victory to
Baba”. Baba sat on a decorated dais where devotees offered him garlands. Most of the
people were charmed by his divine presence – all did not attend to what Baba said in
his discourse.

Other devotees who wanted to be Karma Yogis as well as Jinana Yogis were
noting down His discourse. All were looking at him with unblinking eyes and peacefully
listening to his discourse. The subject of the discourse was, ‘The attraction of the Great
and Sadhana’. The credit for the successful arrangements of the Ramnagar DMC goesto Amulya Ratna Sarangiji and Doctor A.N. Chakravarti. Their efforts were really creditworthy and ideal.

The day after the DMC, Baba boarded the train for Jamalpur. We also entered
the same train and enjoyed Baba’s darshan at every station where the train stopped.
Thus we reached Muzaffarpur.

The joy that used to be experienced in those days in Baba’s darshan and in
listening to his discoursed is beyond decryption. Mostly Baba would inquire personally
about each one who attended DMC. His words were not only givers of extreme joy, but
Margiis would also for the time being forget all their woes and worries.
On return from the DMC there was such inspiration in everyone that whatever
work they picked up they made a success of the same. As this inspiration began to
wear off, there was another DMC in view. Again thought of attending the coming DMC,
having Baba’s darshan. Any listening to his discourse would infuse new spirit in us.
Baba, where have those days disappeared to now? Will Baba ever order the return of
those blissful times?

Although Baba has a thousand ways to fulfill his mission, yet according to my
little intellect the methods adopted by his from 1955 to 1963 were extremely popular
helpful and joyous from the disciples’ angle. In those days, all the disciples understood
each other’s joys and sorrows. I notice several times that if someone was sick is a
family, other Margiis used to brother a how he was to be treated cured. Going to the
doctor, bringing medicines and attending to the sick was done for each other by the
Margiis. They would make the relatives comparatively carefree. Everyone was filled
with the spirit a service and sacrifice. Watching this homogeneity, fellow feeling, service
and ascription in the Margiis used to create a feeling of respect and wonder amongst
the non-Margiis. It was not only appreciated be also influenced them to come to the
path of bliss. In those days, pracar proceeded on these lines.

Salutations to Baba Who Resides as the Soul of all Living
Beings
Thus life was moving on the steam of remembrances of time spent with Baba &
recollection and conversation about incidents connected with Baba.

KRISHNANAGAR DMC: OCTOBER 1958

In the month of October 1958, news came that the DMC will be held at
Krishnanagar is the head quarters of one of the districts in West Bengal. Then it was
realized that this place is very near Navadweep, which has been the birthplace and
held of activities of the great lord Caetanya.

With this relation the desire to attend this DMC grew stronger. This holy place
should already be saturated with devotion due to its association with Caetanya
Mahaprabhu. To this will be added the visit of Baba. This will act like making the beauty
of gold fragrant too.

I recalled the line from saint Tulsidas “One must see, it is worth seeing” and
decided to go.

I felt that devotion would be at its height at that place. A place associated by the actions of Lord Caetanya and a visit by the great Mahakaul Lord Anandamurtiji this willbe like the combination of gold and jewels. 

In the history of spiritualism such occasions are very, very rare. Therefore I firmly decided to attend the DMC.
Now I began to pray to Baba to allow me the opportunity and good fortune to attend this DMC. Baba was kind and things began to look favorable for my visit. 

The great devotee Deep Narayanji met me meanwhile and suggested that we travel via Patna to the DMC which was going to be held in the end of October. 

We remembered Baba and started in time to attend it. At Patna a large number of devotees form U.P. and Delhi met us. The journey with these brothers was heavenly. 

Talking about Baba we reached a station where we had to change the train for Krishnanagar. At that station we met some other Margii brothers who informed us that the train which will bring Baba from Calcutta will be available from there for
Krishnanagar.

Everyone danced with joy to see the prospects of traveling by the same train in which Baba was traveling. We waited for the arrival of the train. All began to thank their stars that our travel program has enabled us to travel up to Krishnanagar by the same train which was begin used by Baba. 

By then the train arrived. The disciples shouted “Victory to Baba” in loudest tones full or overwhelming emotions and love and welcomed Baba.

Baba was in a very happy mood that day. The train also stopped longer than usual on that station. We, therefore, had Baba’s darshan and arranged our seats in the train. Thus we reached Krishnanagar along with Baba. The sight and the mood of
welcome at Krishnanagar was wonderful and moving.

At Krishnanagar station the great devotee Acarya Harprasadji was present with other devotees in multi-coloured dresses and with musical instruments and bands to
welcome Baba. Every one was beside himself with devotion. The slogans of 'Victory to
Baba' and 'Ananda Marga is Immortal' rent the air at the station.
Perhaps after the days of Mahaprabhu Caetanya this was the fresh occasion to
bless this land with the presence of so many spiritual aspirants and the Lord in
between them. The holy land of Krishnanagar was proud of its good luck that the Lord
of devotees was stepping in its soil. It was the every of the land of gods even on that
day.

Although Lord Anandamurtiji transcends the feelings of joy and pain, yet on that
occasion finding such devotees in this number and mood, He spread a vibration of joy
and devotion throughout the station. The people forgot their surroundings and their own
existence in joy. Hardly was there one who was untouched by this blissful wave.
Thus overwhelmed with bhakti, the devotees welcomed the Lord and helped
him to sit in a beautifully decorated grand car. As Baba set in the car, the devotees
formed a circle around it and began to sing devotional songs of rare sweetness. After
sometime they automatically began to dance. As the car slowly moved forward the
troops of devotees also moved along with it dancing and singing in joy.
In front of the lines of devotees there was a band which was playing sweet
tunes suitable for dance. It was most pleasant and convenient for devotees to base
their music and dance on these tunes.

The onlookers were charmed by this sight. Behind Baba’s car were other cars
and behind them were lines of devotees walking on foot. In this way a big processionwas formed whose size went on increasing as the spectators continued to join the
enchanting lines.

This was my first opportunity and so also the first occasion in the memory of
other sadhakas when we saw Baba sitting in a car and moving in a procession. Even
the thousand eyed Indra, the lord of gods must be anxious to possess more eyes to
fully enjoy this divine and multi-coloured sight of devotees dancing and singing in such
abundance of devotion around and behind the Lord. Even the sun seemed charmed
and hanging on to the skies, giving up its journey for the moment, to enjoy this
heavenly sight on earth. Small hits of clouds distributed themselves across the skies to
provide light and shade to the Lord & his devotees. Even the gods must be enjoying
the fate of men seeing them floating in such ever-mounting wave.

The place where arrangements were made for the stay of Baba and devotees
was about four miles from the railway. station. It took about four hours for the
procession to cover this distance in their joyful and artistic movement. Even after such
a strain, there was no sign of tiredness on the faces of the advancing processionists.
On the other hand a supernatural effulgence and joyful shine adorned their faces.
As per traditions in Bengal, when Baba alighted from the car and began to
enter the place of his rest, the devoted ladies gracefully performed arati (worship with
an earthen lamp) and conch shells were blown.

The procession at Krishnanagar was unique from all other processions taken
out so far. Now all the Margiis went to the High School building where arrangements
were made for their stay and left Baba to rest in his room.
At the lunchtime, all were served khichari, which was enjoyed so much by all.

The taste of the khichari was rare and divine. I had eaten khichari hundreds of times in
my life but the taste of this khichari was so unique and different from all the rest.
Salutations to BABA who is the Giver of Dharma, Artha, Kama
and Salvation 

The Margiis of Krishnanagar had arranged a big hall, probably the town hall for
the D.M.C.

Even before Baba arrived this hall was overfull, and still more people were
pouring in. Later on it was that apart form these who were initiated, many uninitiated
persons had also entered the hall to listen to Baba. Many efforts were made to make
these people understand that the speech was only intended for the initiated, but they
insisted on attending. Everyone promised to remain disciplined and calm, but all
insisted on having Baba’s darshan and listening to him.

Baba was informed about this state of affairs. He very graciously allowed all to
remain. Even though this was not announced, still there was not a space to enter the
hall – such was the crowd. Now all the doors were opened and people stood in the
doors and corridors waiting silently for the arrival of the Lord.

When Baba entered, there were loud shouts of victory to Shrii Shrii
Anandamurtiji, which rent the air in the hall. Baba sat on a gracefully decorated seat
which look a like a lotus in full bloom. The local Bhukti Pradhan offered a welcome
garland to Baba and thereafter others garlanded him. One devotee sang a welcome
song. As the song was reverberating in the hall went into ecstasy and fell from their
scats in an unconscious state. With the help of Acarya Sakaldeoji these persons weretaken out in the open and made to lie there. They became normal after sometime. This
was unique sight here that even the uninitiated went into ecstasy at the sight of Baba in
the D.M.C.
