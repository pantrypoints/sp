When the Aryans came from Central Asia to India, they came first to Punjab. 

<!-- the Saptanada Desha (the Land of Seven Rivers), which later on was known as Paiṋcanada Desha or Punjab, (the Land of Five Rivers). -->

Next they entered the Kashmir area.

There they saw pebbles which were bluish in colour, looking like jambu (a fruit that resembles an olive except for the blue colour). 

These pebbles were then known as “jambushilá” (pebbles looking like jambu). 

The country in which, jambushilá was found was named Jambu Dviipa.

At present Jambu is known as Jammu. 

**Jambu Dviipa at that time meant the area stretching from Afghanistan to the Philippines, all of Southeast Asia.** *

{{< n n="How would the Aryans know about Southeast Asia?" >}}


There was and still is a fertile land within Jambu Dviipa where food was easily available.

The people of that area used their free time after work for psychic and spiritual pursuits. 

They practised every possible means of psychic development. 

The patch of land which easily yielded grains was known as Bháratavarśa. 

The word “bhárata” is derived from the Saḿskrta root “bhar” plus the root “tan”. 

When the root “bhar” suffixed by “al” is combined with the root “tan” suffixed by “d́a”, the word “bhárata” is derived.

The word “varśa” means “country” (it can also mean “year” or “rainy season”).

“Bhar” means that which nourishes, and “tan” means that which causes to expand.

Food here was easily available to the Aryans as compared to Central Asia. The extra time at their disposal was utilized in physical, psychic and spiritual expansion.

“Tan” means “to expand.” 

The body of a child goes on expanding up to the age of 39. So the body during this period is “tanu” – that which expands.

After 39, the body is known as “shariira” which means that whose nature is to decay.

The body decays externally or internally after the 39th year of one’s age.

The body of a child is known as “tanu” and that of an adult is known as “shariira.”

Therefore this patch of land was known as Bháratavarśa.

Almost 7,000 years ago Lord Sadashiva was born.
- During His period, people were most undeveloped.

The then people became partly knowledgeable about medicine, art, architecture and education.
- But they did nothing systematically.

People never shared their knowledge with others, because they thought that their prestige would be lessened. 

Thus so many methods of medical treatment and so many crafts were gradually lost due to long periods of disuse.

**In other words, there was no system for all human endeavours.**

Shiva gave a system for song, dance, music, medicine and all other endeavours.

That means the crude-natured people came under a system, under a pattern, through the efforts of Lord Shiva.

Then came Lord Krśńa about 3,500 years ago, when the war of the Mahábhárata took place.

People’s individual qualities then had not taken a collective shape.

People did not know the art of living collectively.

Lord Krśńa gave a sense of collectivity to individuals.

Suppose a person has a faculty for medicine.

If his medical knowledge is channelled and utilized in a medical college, this will bring about the collective shaping of one’s individual attribute. 

This applies to all faculties. Lord Krśńa wanted to bring about a social synthesis, the seed of which was sown by Lord Shiva.

During the time of Lord Krśńa, the Amga, Bamga, Kalimga, Magadha, Saorastra and other kingdoms (Amga Bamga Kalimgesu Saorastra Magadhesu ca) were within Bharatavarsa. 

But they fought among themselves because they had no collective sense.

Lord Krśńa thought that if He combined all there would be collective spirit in the true sense of the term. 

Then alone all human faculties would get expanded. He tried to make people understand, but they did not understand, because there was no collective spirit in them as was the case in ancient England.

In ancient England there were so many countries, named Sussex, Essex, Yorkshire, etc.

Along with these there were Wales and Scotland. At last all combined and made Great Britain.

Similar were Amga, Bamga, Kalimga, Saorastra and Magadha in India.

Lord Krśńa wanted to combine them and make Mahábhárata (Great India).

To synthesize them all Lord Krśńa was born, and to help in the mission of Lord Krśńa came the Paiṋca Páńd́avas, Bhisma, Vidura and the others.

Therefore the book is known as Mahábhárata (Great India).
