Jarasandha would usually attack the Shurasena.
- The capital of Shurasena was Mathura.

<!-- There also Lord Krśńa presented an example of His practical approach.  -->

The righteous people then were not united. It was not possible to fight against Jarasandha. 

This is why Krisna shifted His capital from Mathura to Dwaraka of Gujarat which was across:
- the desert of Rajasthan
- the hillocks and jungles of Madhya Pradesh.

Magadha soldiers in the plains could not cross the desert or jungle or fight in them.

<!-- Hence, the capital was shifted to Dwaraka . -->

This was a great practical approach by Lord Krśńa, and Jarasandha stopped attacking.*

After that, Lord Krśńa united the kings in the name of dharmarájya, and attacked Magadha unitedly and killed Jarasandha.

While at Mathura, it was difficult for Him to do this from a diplomatic point of view.*

{{< n n="This means that Mathura fell to the enemy and was recaptured by Krishna" >}}

When power is gained sufficiently, the enemy has to be attacked and killed.
- As long as there is no power, one has to accept the dictates of the enemy. 
- But the moment it is gained, he has to be attacked and killed.

<!-- Such was the practical approach of Lord Krśńa.  -->

When Jarasandha was defeated, he begged pardon. But Lord Krśńa did not forgive him, as his nature was not reformed. 

In the ensuing battle, Jarasandha was killed.

After that, Lord Krśńa attacked Aḿgadesha (the [[modern-day]] Bhagalpur area).

 <!-- This was also His practical approach. -->

In that period in the Delhi area, there was an Aryan population because that is where the Indian people first accepted Aryan culture. 

The Aryans of that time in the Delhi area were called Játrii Kśatriya or Jat in the present language.
- This included the Kaoravas and Pandavas.
<!-- The Saḿskrta name was Játrii Kśatriya.  -->
 <!-- were the same, the present Jat people. -->

The other group of Aryans living in that area were called Ábhiira. They usually fought against the Jat people.

 <!-- This group of people was known as .  -->

<!-- These were the 2 main Aryan groups. -->
- The Játrii Kśatriyas were mainly agriculturists
- The Ábhiiras were mainly dependent on cattle breeding.

<!-- These were the 2 main branches of the Aryans.  -->

The Ábhiira became “Áhira” in the present language – they lived in Meerut, Haryana and near Delhi.
