## Movement of Microvita

These microvita move throughout the entire universe, from one celestial body to another*. 


{{< n n="This is because they are of the Spatial Layer and celestial bodies are spacetime vortices." >}}


They move everywhere, crossing the boundaries of nebulae, piercing through galaxies, stars, satellites, planets and meteors. They move unbarred, without caring for the atmospheric conditions or barometric readings. 

How do they move? Everybody requires some media for movement. Mobility means movement through a medium or media. 

There may be more than one medium. There may be many media at a time in the same movement. 

These microvita also move through several media. 

1. Sound

**They move through sound.** 

The so-called virus of a diseased person may move through his or her sound. 


2. Touch

They may move through tactuality*. 


{{< n n="I felt this myself when I touched a Buddha Relic. But it was more of the chi of the relic instead of its microvita." >}}


3. Visual

They may move through forms or shapes. 

4. Smell

In the case of some of the diseases, the disease spreads through the smell of the disease.

5. Ideas [Metavita Only]

The subtlest microvita are called "metavita". These metavita may move through ideas. 

**A particular idea may get accelerated speed in a particular planet with the help of a few conceptually developed minds.** 

That is, a great man with a great conceptually-developed mind may spread his ideas with the help of these metavita throughout that planet, or even throughout this universe in different celestial bodies.


### Microvita as Life-Carriers

What is the root cause of this universe? Which is the starting point of life or vitality? 

**These microvita are the carriers of life in different stars, planets and satellites – not carbon atoms or carbon molecules.** *

{{< n n="The microvita that make up the carbon atoms carry life, not the carbon atoms.">}}

These living creatures with their mysterious movement create minds and bodies, living bodies in different celestial bodies.

They also destroy minds and physical bodies, or developed or undeveloped corpor, in any corner of this universe. 

So the root cause of life is not the unicellular protozoa or unit protoplasmic cell, but this unit microvitum.

<!-- Medium of life? -->

There should be extensive research work regarding these microvita. 

Our task is gigantic and we are to start our research work regarding these microvita immediately without any further delay. Otherwise many problems in modern society will not be solved in a nice way. 

Pramá [equilibrium and equipoise] is an essentiality in the field of intellectuality or intellectual pursuit.

Similarly, in the higher intellectual realm research work on these microvita is extremely necessary.

**These microvita are a creation in the internal phase, rather in the returning phase of cosmic expression.** *


Phase | Description
--- | ---
Extrovert / First | Subtle into crude
Introvert / Returning | Crude into subtle


We are human beings with developed intellect. I think, rather I hope, rather I am sure that the day is sure to come when human beings will have proper control over these microvita.


## The 7 Structures of Microvita Based on Subtlety or Crudeness

In ancient times, sages said that the singular or collective structures of these microvita are of 7 species:

1. yakśa
2. gandharva
3. vidyádhara
4. kinnara
5. siddha
6. prakrtiliina
7. videhaliina 

This is according to the nature of their subtlety or the nature of their crudeness.

By dint of our physico-psycho-spiritual sádhaná, our minds will develop in all [their] strata.

The power of conception will also develop. This will help us know all the secrets of these microvita.
