Microvita are innumerable times more subtle and smaller than atoms.

An atom is not detectable by an ordinary microscope.

How then can microvita be detected by:
- an ordinary microscope or 
- ordinary perception in the psychic sphere
- inferences?

**Each structure of carbonic origin in this universe, whether animate or inanimate, has a mind.** 
- A mind is associated with every structure either:
  - in manifested form or
  - in dormant form. 

Wherever there is no mind, there is no endoplasmic [higher mind] coverage.

Wherever the mind is expressed, endoplasmic coverage shall be there. 

**Wherever there is mind, it must require pabula of both carbonic and non-carbonic nature.** 

- When psychic pabulum is of carbonic nature, psychic movement is towards the crude.
- If psychic pabulum is of non-carbonic nature, psychic movement is towards subtlety. 

Non-carbonic psychic pabulum helps in spiritual and supra-psychic motivation.

A genuine spiritual aspirant must be very careful in selecting his or her food. 

- Carbonic pabula help maintain and nourish the physical structure.
- Non-carbonic pabula help strengthen the psychic structure. 

An intake of more and more defective carbonic pabula adversely affects the psychic triangle of forces. 
- It thus hinders one’s psycho-spiritual progress. 
- A stage may come when the physical structure becomes almost mindless. 

An example is in a mythological fable in the epic Rámáyana where Ahalyá was turned into stone for a sin she committed.

There are 2 ill-effects when people get detached from non-carbonic pabula and become increasingly engrossed in carbonic pabula:

1. The arena of one’s own carbonic pabula will increase -- the mind will gradually and steadily drift towards crude matter.

2. One’s mind will think in terms of devouring other’s carbonic pabula. 

This is the psychological explanation of imperialism which originates in the psyche and functions in the psychic arena. 

When expressed externally it takes various forms, such as:
- capitalism
- state capitalism
- communism
- nationalism
- communalism
- parochialism
- provincialism
- socialism
- caste-imperialism
- male chauvinism
- lingualism, etc. 

Once I went to a big village where the people’s language was Bengali. 
- But even in the primary school, Hindi was taught there substituting the mother-language. 
- It is a glaring example of lingual imperialism.

These are all the same psychic ailments in various forms and figures.

Goaded by this psychic ailment:
- a superpower forces its own selfish national interests on other weaker states to establish its suzerainty politically, militarily, etc. 
- an imperialist power wants to dominate and exploit other socio-politico-economic units as an expansion, perpetration and consolidation of its vested interests
- a powerful linguistic group suppresses other minority linguistic groups
- the so-called upper castes subjugate the so-called lower castes in society and suck their vital juice under so many pleas and disguises
- opportunistic males curtail the rights of women in various ways. 

In all these cases, the same inherent psychological malady of imperialism prevails.

Imperialism is anti-human. 

It runs counter to:
- the spirit of Neo-humanism and
- the ethics of human life. 

It is detrimental to pramá saḿvrddhi, pramá rddhi and pramá siddhi in human society. 

It thwarts human progress and creates global wars and all sorts of divisive and destructive forces in society.

Imperialism is a negative force, a destructive phenomenon, which generates exploitative and unjust conditions in individual and collective life. 

Such a poisonous radiation of black force attracts negative forces like negative microvita. 

Those negative microvita intensify and escalate the demonic activities of imperialism in all aspects of human society – art, literature, education, trade, commerce, industry, agriculture, morality and social relations. 

They cultivate a psychology based on:
- slavery
- inferiority complex
- pseudo-culture
- psycho-economic exploitation

In certain cases, they cause nihilism and cynicism.

Imperialism is rooted deep in the human psyche.

In order to wipe it out, neo-ethics based on the following points is indispensable:

1. **The Macrocosmic Entity must be accepted as the supreme desideratum in human life.**

2. **There should be happy adjustment and balanced blending between carbonic and non-carbonic pabula.**

This is the Neo-ethics of the present age -- a panacea for the present imperialistic social ills and a mesh of psychic disorders. 

The application of Neo-ethics will lead to multi-lateral salvation of human society by removing:
- economic exploitation
- political suppression
- religious indoctrination
- cultural imposition
- social subordination.


## The Role of Guru

If there is a happy adjustment and balanced blending between carbonic and non-carbonic pabula in the human mind and body, there will be no imperialism at all. Rather, heaven will descend on the dusty earth.

While following the path of Neo-ethics, human beings will attain enormous progress in the spiritual sphere with greater speed.

With the help of non-carbonic pabula they will sharpen their psychic penetration within inter- and intra-atomic and molecular space. 

With the help of microvita, they will be able to powder down their ectoplasms [lover minds] and transform them into cognitive faculto-factors*.

The majority of people today do not know the technique of using microvita. 

The Universal Entity sits in one place. He has been using microvita to accelerate the spiritual growth of individuals in different celestial bodies in different ways. 

Only that Supreme Entity who is conversant with these techniques and can teach them to individual spiritual aspirants is the Supreme Guru. 

He keeps all within His contact, and with the help of microvita, elevates all spiritually.

Living beings, through their own individual efforts, can achieve only a little progress in the carbonic world. But in the non-carbonic world only the grace of the Supreme Guru can lead them towards the supreme goal.

Hence, it has been rightly said,

Gurukrpá hi kevalam

“The Guru’s grace is everything.”

This alone is the supreme truth. This is the be-all and end-all of life.
