Microvitum is the inner secret of life, and of vital progress in the three fields of:

1. Physicality
2. Psyche
3. Spirituality

This theory of microvita must not be neglected nor ignored. 

You must properly propagate and establish the theory, denomination and emanation of microvita. 

Many chemical formulae are to be changed, many structures in the entire universe are to undergo metamorphosis. 

<!-- The entire world is eagerly waiting for you to bring all-round metamorphosis.  -->

Why will chemical formulae undergo metamorphosis?

<!-- Just now I told you that the application of microvita in the practical field will bring about radical changes in various chemical formulae.  -->

What sort of change or metamorphosis will take place? 

The concept of physical science is that carbon atoms are indispensable for the origin of life. 

After people are acquainted with the theory of microvita, they will no longer subscribe to the old concepts. 

People will be introduced to higher and subtler formulae than the present ones regarding the internal structure of objects.

<!-- Let me explain this matter more elaborately.  -->

For example, the recognized formula for green vitriol (ferrous sulphate) is FeSO4 7H20.

But after a chemist is acquainted with the theory of microvita, he will no longer use this formula. 

He will prefer to use the new formula – say FeSO4 7H20 (Group A MV 20 million). 

Copper sulphate (blue vitriol) is CUS04 5H20. 

After the theory of microvita is well established, a chemist will use the new formula – CUS04 5H20 (Group B MV 20 million)*.

{{< n n="Microvita here has quality (as qualitative differences between varities, as Group B) and quantity (as millions)" >}}


This means the chemical formulae regarding the inner structure of objects is undergoing a tremendous change. 

**The size of formulae will be bigger than what they are today.** *

{{< n n="Our qualimath has the scope for such increased formulas because it allows the notation of qualities " >}}


But the denomination of the object and its internal qualities will not be changed. 

There will only be a change in the chemical formulae. 

A scientist in the microvita age will refuse to accept the carbon atom as the rudimental factor for the emergence of life. To him, a carbon atom is billions of microvita getting solidified.

All microvita are not of the same type. There are qualitative differences amongst different varieties of microvita.

In modern biology, protoplasmic cells are made of carbon atoms. But in the microvita age, the biologist will say that the protoplasmic cells are not made of carbon atoms. Rather, they are the collective solidified form of innumerable microvita.

By controlling the microvita of the protoplasmic cells, big changes can be effected within the human body. 

Ordinary people can be made extraordinary.

Their mental qualities and capabilities can be enlarged by supplying microvita in sufficient quantity. 

The theory of microvita has immense potentialities in introducing numerous changes in human society. 

Changing microvita will cause ectoplasmic changes [lower mind]. This in turn will bring about endoplasmic change [higher mind]. 

Thus, the mind will be able to control the organism, the physical body, in a better way.

Consequently, there will be remarkable changes in the overall personalities of human beings. 

These changes will take place in the internal sphere as much as in the external structure. 

The personalities of human beings will not be the same as they are now. 

Due to changes in the nerve cells, a change in the ectoplasmic cells [cells with lower mind] also occurs. As a result, the effulgence of the body changes.

In the age of microvita, the appearance of the physical body will change. 

Human beings will become more psychic than physical. In the next phase, they will become more spiritual than psychic.
