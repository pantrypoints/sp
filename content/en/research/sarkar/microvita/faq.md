<!-- – generally they coincide in the spiritual stratum – in that case or in that particular country, -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Suppose a country's physical, psychic, and spiritual pramátrikońa do not coincide. How can good thinking people fight against the depraving effects of enemy microvita?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
By nature, some microvita are your friends, some are your enemies. If controlled by good people, they are your friends. If controlled by bad people, they are your enemies. Your enemy microvita can become your friends if controlled by good people. 

Poison and snake venom are used as a medicine. If millions of physical, psychic, and spiritual pramátrikońas do not coincide in a single point, then there will be a tug of war amongst them. Finally, they will get deranged and their inner balance will be destroyed.

<!-- . They will reach the stage of disruption. -->

{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
When they coincide, the triangle of forces comes in proximity with the guńatrikońa. There are several million physical pramátrokońas, psychic pramátrikońas and spiritual pramátrikońas.

If pramátrikońas are destroyed, good people should take the help of friendly microvita.

 <!-- Some microvita are, in effect, your friends and some are your enemies.  -->

By nature, no microvitum is either a friend or enemy of human beings: *Na kashcit kasyacit mitraḿ na kashcit kasyacit ripúh; Vyavaháreńa mitráńi jáyante ripavastathá.* [No one is the friend or enemy of anyone by nature. By one’s behaviour a person may become friendly or inimical to others.]

Microvita which are harmful by nature may become your friends if controlled by good people. Though poison is fatal for humans, it is also a life-saving drug. Even snake venom is recognized by all as a medicine.

How can good people fight against the evil effect of negative microvita? 
{{< /r >}}

<!-- Microvita may be your friend – the collective body of microvita may be your friend – or they may not be your friend. What are good people to do under such circumstances? -->

{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
There will be a tug-of-war amongst these 3 triangles and finally they will get deranged, and disturbed. The Pramá amongst all these three triangles will be lost.

In order to encourage the movement of positive microvita and to discourage the movement of negative microvita, should the education system of the entire world and the entire universe be reoriented? What should be done regarding the educational system of the universe, not only of India and this small planet of ours? 
{{< /r >}}

<!-- What should be the approach? What should be the stages, the phases, the physico-psychic and psycho-spiritual approach? -->


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
The question is a bit knotty. We must develop the physico-psychic aspect of students through proper physical culture, which will include yoga ásanas, proper diet, games, sports, etc. 

To develop the psycho-spiritual aspect, we must:
- reorient the entire curriculum of all schools from kindergarten to postgraduate level according to the Neohumanist philosophy
- incorporate the practices of Aśt́áuṋga Yoga into the curriculum in all grades. 

This will be the practical approach. The controlling philosophy should be: “This universe is ours” – and “we” means humans, animals and plants.

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Is the knowledge regarding microvita parávidyá or aparávidyá?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
Certainly it is aparávidyá, because parávidyá is psycho-spiritual knowledge. But this aparávidyá will help us much in attaining the stage of parávidyá, the layer of spirituality, the lower strata of parávidyá.

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Do these microvita occupy any space? Is that space ethereal, psychic or supra-psychic?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
According to degrees of subtlety:
- some microvita occupy ethereal space [metaphysical space]
- some occupy psychic space
- some occupy supra-psychic space. 

Supra-psychic is where the psychic comes in continuous contact with the spiritual – the silver lining between the spiritual and psychic. **The spiritual level is not for microvita because they are something created by the cosmic mind.**
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
Some microvita occupy the subtlest layer of the physical sphere. The subtler ones are psychic. 

Some are still higher -- supra-psychic. 

According to their subtlety, some microvita can be seen by a microscope. Some cannot be seen but come in contact with mind through their actional faculty. Some can be seen by highly developed conceptual minds functioning within the field of perception.

Microvita do not only function within the physical stratum. They also function within the psychic stratum. But they do not function within the spiritual stratum. 

They cannot affect the spiritual structure. But they can affect both the physical and psychic structures.

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Can there be any correlation between the specialities of the nuclear structure of the carbon atom (mobility, motivity and existential faculty) with those of microvita?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
You know nothing about the nuclear structure of microvita. You know a little about the nuclear structure of carbon atoms. You know a few specialities of carbon atoms. 

There can be a proper adjustment and correlation* with friendly microvita. For other microvita there cannot be any correlation. They are ultravires to the existence of each other.
{{< /l >}}

{{< n n="This is because the correlation depends on the perceiving mind." >}}

{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
When a few negative microvita penetrate your body, you feel very uneasy. But when millions of negative microvita enter, it does not take more then a few seconds for even an elephant to die. 

If neutral microvita enter your body, you do not feel anything special. When friend microvita enter your body, you do not feel anything special. When friend microvita enter your body and mind, you have a comfortable feeling.

A few negative microvita, when they enter the human body and mind, bring much change in the feelings, but when millions of them enter, it becomes very difficult for anyone to survive long. 

**Ordinarily, microvita become more active in the night when human beings are asleep.** *
