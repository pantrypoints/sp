<!-- ### Questions and Answers on Microvita – Section C -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
If the medicine or mother tincture required for homoeopathic medicine is prepared in a sentient environment which contains positive microvita, will the medicine prepared from that medium or mother tincture have more effect than ordinary medicine available in the market?

{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
Medicine prepared in a sentient environment by sentient people, from a medium or mother tincture which is also prepared in a sentient environment, will attract more positive microvita than ordinary medicines. It will have a much greater effect in curing a patient.

If a person contracts a disease caused by negative microvita before initiation and does dhyána sincerely after initiation, the disease will not spread but be contained. 

However, for different types of diseases one has to follow different food restrictions and practice dhyána at specific times.

If a person contracts a disease caused by negative microvita after initiation, does dhyána perfectly and follows certain food restrictions, the disease will be completely cured.

Dhyána attracts many positive microvita. Negative microvita can only be controlled by positive microvita. 

**The positive microvita eat the negative microvita. This is the reason why the disease is cured.** 

Jaundice is a disease caused by negative microvita. If dhyána is practised perfectly, the disease will be cured very quickly.

In the case of cancer, say stomach cancer, certain food restrictions will have to be strictly followed. 

When pain starts in the stomach, one should sit for dhyána. But just prior to this one should take some juice from a sweet fruit, not a sour one. 

After performing dhyána, one should take another drink which is different from the first drink. 

The patient should also avoid any food which causes gas in the stomach, such as pappad, cauliflower, cabbage, turnip, etc.

<!-- Questions and Answers on Microvita – Section D -->

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
In archaeological history, has positive or negative microvita collectively influenced this earth or the cosmos? What is your guess regarding Atlantis, Oceanis and Gondwanaland?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
Human beings came here 1 million years ago. But the history of civilization starts from the time of the Rg Veda, 15,000 years ago. 

From 1 million - 15,000 years ago, or 985,000 years, between the Miocene and the Oligocene ages, was human society in a dormant state?

Humans invented pictorial letters less than 7,000 years ago. The 4 symbols of advancement, or of full-fledged civilization, are agriculture, the wheel, dress and script. This started 7,000 years ago. 

<!-- Is there any role of microvita, positive or negative? It is another question. -->

With regard to civilization, there has been little progress during 985,000 years. 

All the progress has taken place within the last 15,000 years, from the time of the Rg Veda, the oldest unwritten book of the world. (At that time people could not write).
