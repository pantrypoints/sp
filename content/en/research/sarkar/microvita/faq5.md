Do microvita influence the mind first, or matter first, of any human or living structure? 
{{< /r >}}

 <!-- physico-psychic plexus -->
{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
Negative microvita can function directly at the throat chakra. But they cannot reach directly to the occult plexus.

Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and may be elevated up to the occult plexus.

But negative microvita may be elevated to the lunar plexus by another course. 

If negative microvita affect the mind, the mind may undergo derangement. But negative microvita cannot affect the mind directly.

Positive microvita may be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers, but not for spiritual power or spiritual development.

Suppose a man is deaf and dumb. 

Hearing and speech are controlled by nerve cells or nerve fibres which in turn are controlled with the help of the lunar plexus*.

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, this is the pineal gland." >}}


Positive microvita may function directly up to the lunar plexus. But there at the lunar plexus, if positive microvita are to influence the nerve cells, they require some special power. 

Positive microvita cannot do something supernatural with the help of the nerve cells – they require some special power of some powerful person.

Suppose the Sadguru is saying something. The deaf or dumb man wants to hear it but cannot. 

If one concentrates the mind on **varábhaya mudrá**, there will be the direct effect of positive microvita on the auricular or other nerve cells and also on the controlling cells. 

He may get back the power of hearing all of a sudden. 

One should look towards these two mudrás and not to anything else. **Microvita are radiated through these two mudrás.** This is the inner secret.

This is supernatural, but not illogical. It is supernatural because it does not come within the scope of natural phenomena. 

Here the inner secret does not lie with microvita.

During the last Vaeshákhii Púrńimá at Ananda Nagar, there were many spiritual aspirants who wanted that the speed of our progress should be accelerated regarding the establishment of Ananda Marga on this planet. 

Did you mark that after Dharma Mahácakra (DMC) the speed has accelerated? This is the effect of positive microvita through these two mudrás.

If a deaf man sincerely wants to hear what the Sadguru is saying, the positive microvita radiated through these two mudrás are sure to help him.

<!-- During this DMC, some boys mentally expressed that we should go on fighting. Now see our boys and girls will go on fighting, and fight in the realm of spirituality means victory. -->


{{< l a="PR Sarkar" >}}
The highest point up to which negative microvita can function is the throat chakra. 

 <!-- physico-psychic plexus,   lunar plexus -->

But with the application of some force, they can be raised up to the ajna chakra. 

This raising is called “risti” or “rusti”. The ajna chakra is the highest point of positive microvita. If positive microvita are raised above this point to the occult plexus, it is called “krpá”.

<!-- That is, raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus  is called “krpá”. And  -->

Raising them from the lunar plexus to the pinnacled point of human glory [beyond the occult plexus] is called “karuńá”. Without krpá there cannot be karuńá, there cannot be any galloping jump. 

Raising negative microvita above the psycho-physical plexus is “rusti” or “risti”. You should always try to avoid rusti and always try to receive the glamour of krpá or karuńá.
