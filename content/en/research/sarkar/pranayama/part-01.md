Pranayama means the controlling theory of Pranah. 

All actions, physical or mental are performed with the help of energy.
- We derive this energy from food, light, water and air. 

**But the activation of the energy depends on the movement of Prana Shakti (Vital Energy).** 

When there is no movement of Prana Shakti in a dead body, even if you put it in the light and give it food still it will not work. 

The external expression of Prana Shakti is accomplished through the medium of Indriyas (motor and sensory organs). 

As you move your hand or walk, understand that behind all these actions lie the motor and sensory organs, which are working under the direction of the mind. 

Mind flows in accordance with the flow of Prana -- according to inhaling and exhaling. 

<!-- That is why it has been said: -->
<!-- Indriya'n'a'm manona'thah manona'tho'stu ma'rutah -->

Mind is the master of Indriyas.
- Mind itself is controlled by Vayu. 

Vayu enables respiration. Respiration creates a rhythm according to which mind flows. 

Vibration of mind depends on this rhythm. 

When one is engaged in some vigorous physical activities, like jumping or running, the rhythm in the physical body is increased. 
- Simultaneously, the flow of Prana Shakti also grows more while adjusting with the flow of the body. 

If a running person breathes deeply, the effect on the mind is opposite.
- The faster the breathing, the less is the mental power of thinking and receiving.

<!-- While running, people  just the reciprocal, the more is the speed of respiration,  -->

Conversely, if the mind is in some deeper thought and if its flow has increased, breathing shall slow down.

<!-- respiration shall grow very slowly.  -->

If you visualize your respiration after deep thought or after doing Dharana and Dhyana, you will find that your brething is slow.

<!-- respiration is going on very slowly.  -->

**The more the mental flow or the more the concentration of mind, the less is the speed of respiration.** 
- Conversely, the faster the respiration, the less the mental concentration.

If a man eats something while running, he will be unable to enjoy its taste.
- He has eaten it physically but not mentally.

It is only when one sits calmly and eats, that he can enjoy the taste.

While running you cannot catch the fine music going on. 

Spiritual practice also depends on mental concentration which alone can enable you to proceed ahead towards the spiritual goal.

Mental concentration can be helped by Prana Shakti. 

If you can control Prana Shakti, then you can increase or decrease its speed.

 <!-- the latter is under your control ‑ meaning thereby that you have attained a control over  by which you can   -->

Whenever you practice Kumbhaka (hold the breath within or without) you suspend your Prana Shakti for  the time being. 

<!-- hakti or respiration, there is no chance of deep concentration or mental suspension.  -->

To have mental concentration, you create a congenial situation through artificial process as Pranayama. This brings Prana Shakti under control.

<!-- Or Tasmin satisha'va'sa prashva'sayorgati vicchedah Pranayamah ‑ 

Respiration is going on under its natural system of control, the process by which you change the system and control it to flow as you wish, is known as Pranayama. -->

Since ancient times, the accepted formula of Pranayama is 1:4:2.

Pranayama has a close association with Vayu.

As such, the controlling centre of Pranayama should be such, with which Vayu has a direct contact, and Va'yu has direct contact with heart and lungs, and 

With the rest of the body it has an indirect relation. 

Anahata, therefore, is the natural Cakra for physical Pranayama where you are not concerned with the psychic aspect. 

Constant practice of Pranayama at the Anahata will adjust and accustom all the glands, sub‑glands, joints of the body, its blood pressure.

Until such a stage has not been reached, Kumbhaka Pranayama should not be taught to the Sadhaka, he should only do Sadharana Pranayama (without Kumbhaka).

This is why I have instructed you to take permission before teaching Kumbhaka Pranayama. One who is doing it without taking permission, is taking risk over oneself.

<!-- There are some more points which are also kept in mind -->
