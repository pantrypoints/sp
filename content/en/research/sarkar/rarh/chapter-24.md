The world is rhythmic. The subtler reverberations in human brains which manifest themselves in the realm of language are the first mundane expressions of the subtle world. 

Hence the sound tanmátra(1) is the subtlest of tanmátras.

Whether or not an individual is educated, he or she can give ecstatic expression to his or her deep feelings only through language. 

One may say that the subtlest stratum of art is the lines of drawing, and not words or language spoken or written. 

This is true, but are not “drawing” and “writing” here just two different names for language? “Aban Tagore writes pictures.” 

What is the meaning here of the word “writes”?

It means that he actually writes language [through painting]. Humans cannot express in the form of spoken language even one per cent of what they feel deep inside; they cannot express in writing everything that they can express in spoken language; and they cannot express through drawings everything that they can express in writing.

This is why the art of painting is a subtler art – because here even higher expressions remain confined within a few lines of drawing. 

It is like a violin, which has no frets, amid musical instruments studded with frets.(2) 

But the fact of the matter is that the expression is purely acoustic.

The resonance of wisdom that lies within these acoustic expressions easily captivates the human mind and seizes human attention, carrying it to the realm of ideas.

This happened in the past due to the inspiration created by the Shaeva ideal of Lord Sadáshiva, and thus it was possible to distribute the taste of aesthetic feelings through the medium of the inner sweetness of the human mind. This is Ráŕh’s Baul, and that Baul is thoroughly drenched with Shaeva Dharma.

The spirit of Baul is: 

“I am unable to embrace Him and make Him my own – Him whom I know, recognize and realize, and who is my nearest kin, my life and soul (in Rabindranath’s words jiivan devatá) – and in a bid to embrace Him, I roam about, searching him vigorously in heaven, earth and the nether world.”

“Ráŕher Bául, Ráŕher Bául, káre tumi cáo?”
“Cái yáháre pái ne táre kotháy bale dáo.”

[“O Baul of Ráŕh, O Baul of Ráŕh, tell me whom you want.”
“I cannot find Him whom I want, O tell me where He is.”]

If Shiva is the life and soul not only of Ráŕh, but also of the world, we can say that Baul is the worldly reverberation of the Shaeva ideals.

Kiirtana is prevalent in various places and various forms. 

But one of the reasons for the ineffability and divine sweetness of Ráŕh’s kiirtana is that it is inspired by the ideas embodied in Baul. 

The other kinds of affair related to vocal and instrumental music are concerned with body and mind, i.e.; their appeal is to body and mind. 

Therein lies their supremacy and other-worldly charm which can be touched, yet cannot be touched. Ráŕh’s kiirtana, on the other hand, based on Baul, appeals to the mind and also to the soul. So the kiirtana of Ráŕh not only overwhelms the human mind; it causes a person to become completely lost.

Kiirtana composed according to nandana vijiṋána induces in a person the tactual perception of mohana vijiṋána.(3) 

The kiirtana of Ráŕh is not merely saḿgiita [song, dance and instrumental music]; it sways the finite humankind with the vibration of the unlimited and infinite; it makes humans in their little homes hear the call of the far-away blue firmament. Hence it is outstanding and unparalleled.


Kiirtane ár Báuler gáne ámrá diyechi khuli,
Maner gopane nibhrta bhuvane dvár chila yataguli.

–Satyendranath Dutta

[Through kiirtana and Baul songs we have opened up –
Opened up all the doors hidden in our minds and in our solitary worlds.]

Let me say one more thing. Kiirtana is not like Baul, which is more verbal than written. Kiirtana is both verbal and written. So of course kiirtana comes within the purview not only of culture, but also of literature.

The life of Ráŕh is ensconced in Baul. The psychology of the people there is basicalLy to be content with little. Once their bare subsistence is more or less assured, they no longer run after money.

The jhumur songs of Ráŕh fall within that part of literature which is connected neither with hita [welfare] nor with ahita [troubles]. 

I do not mean to say by this that jhumur songs are lacking in subtlety; subtlety is very much there. [Jhumur songs can delight people as long as they are not inclined towards ahita.] 

Jhumur songs are indigenous to Ráŕh. Bhavakritananda Ojha of Deoghar was the main composer of jhumur songs. Another important composer was Pachai Shaikh of Manbhum. Here is an example of a jhumur song:

{{< q c="Kataras, Dhanbad" >}}
Kata baul phot́e-e-e-e-e
Pather dháre go pather dháre,
U gánye yába nái, yába nái, yába nái re.
U gánye yeitye man keman kare
Kiser neshá yena jaŕáni dhare,
D́ar láge kakhan ke cupisáre
Yadi paráń káŕe.
U gánye yába nái, yába nái, yába nái re.
U gánye tháke ke jáni nái nám,
Shudhu kánkan váje kár shuńechilam
Hámár buk kana kana sei theikye gela nái re
Dekhái yata ojhá re
U gánye yába nái, yába nái, yába nái re.
Tabu gharke yeitye man náhi sare,
Damká háoyá yena mátál kare,
Mahul phuler jhánjhe neshá dhare,
I rager(4) upáy kii bale de, bale de re
U gánye yába nái, yába nái, yába nái re.

[How many bauls(5) bloom-m-m-m-m
By the side of the path, lo, by the side of the path,
To that village I shall not go, shall not go, shall not go.
To that village I long to go
Inebriated I feel
Afraid lest someone gently
Take my life away.
To that village I shall not go, shall not go, shall not go.
Who lives there I don’t know her name,
Only heard her bangle jingle
Since then the throbs of my heart still nagging
All exorcists have failed.
To that village I shall not go, shall not go, shall not go.
Still undecided to go home,
As though a gusty wind makes me drunken,
Pungent mahul flowers intoxicate me,
Tell me, tell me, the remedy of this malady
To that village I shall not go, shall not go, shall not go.]

What we mean by márga saḿgiita, or classical music, is to control and direct musical notes and rhythmic expression through an approach based on acoustic science and psychology. This classical music (dance-song-instruments) takes on different characteristics in different places. These local characteristics are called gharáńás [styles particular to particular places]. Ráŕhii kiirtana also has four such styles, viz., 1) Manoharsháhii, 2) Garánhát́á, 3) Renet́i and 4) Mandárań. In other forms of musical culture also, besides kiirtana, Ráŕh had its own styles. Vishnupur, the capital of Mallabhum, for centuries occupied the highest place in the classical expression of music. Most of the famous singers not only of Ráŕh, but also of Bengal as a whole, hail from Vishnupur or its neighbouring areas. Due to a lack of proper effort and zeal, the Vishnupur style is now on the brink of ruin.

Footnotes

(1) Literally, “minutest fraction of that,” i.e., of a given rudimental factor of matter. Also translated “generic essence” or “inferential wave”. The various types of tanmátras convey the senses of hearing, touch, form (vision), taste and smell. –Trans.

(2) In A Few Problems Solved Part 1, “The Practice of Art and Literature”, the author has said: “Yet it is in painting and sculpture, which are considered the subtlest of all arts, that we find the true expression of the wonderful aesthetic sense of the human mind. In the calm stillness of a painting or a sculpture, all has to be vividly expressed – laughter and tears, hopes and fears, gestures and language. Indeed, it is the arts of painting and sculpture that beautifully bridge the gap between the mundane and the supramundane.” –Trans.

(3) Nandana vijiṋána [aesthetic science] is the science of giving joy to others and getting joy from others. Mohana vijiṋána [supra-aesthetic science] is the science by which the supreme draws the microcosms closer to Himself through inferential and other ectoplasmic attractions, or by attracting others to Himself through His irresistible charms. It is the endeavour to ensconce the microcosmic entity, the individual entitative rhythm, in the eternal being, the infinite rhythm of Parama Puruśa. Other music comes within the scope of aesthetic science, but kiirtana comes within the scope of mohana vijiṋána. So of all the branches of music, kiirtana is the best. –Trans.

(4) In the rural language of Ráŕh, many persons pronounce the word as rag instead of rog [“disease”]. For example, the word baŕa rag is used for the disease of leprosy.

(5) Baul means the bakul flower (Spanish cherry, Minusops elangi) and is not related to Bául, i.e., the Bauls. The author has noted here: “In Ráŕhii Bengali, bakul is pronounced baul, e.g., Bakalpur → Baulpur → Bolpur.” –Trans.
