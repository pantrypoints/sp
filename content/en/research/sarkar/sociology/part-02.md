Both the origin and the culminating point of the movement of human beings is the same.

It is the natural law for any entity to originate from the same source and to merge in the same source.

The fundamental stuff of all the humans of this world is the Macrocosmic Consciousness. 

<!-- All are the children of the Supreme Immortality (Amrtasya Puttŕah).  -->

Fundamentally all human beings are equal. <!-- Therefore there should not be any discrimination. --> 

In the external world, however, there are numerous conflicts and strife among humans. 

<!-- The poet Rabindranath Tagore said,

Hiḿsáy unmatta prthvii nitya nit́hura dvandva
Ghora kut́ila pantha táhára lobha jat́ila bandha.
[Mad with violence is the world,
Cruel are the battles which [[rage]] each day.
Crooked indeed are the ways of the world
Bound by the noose of greed.] -->

<!-- The various races and countries have been plagued with clashes and conflicts due to petty, selfish interests. Every house is shaken with conflict. How many wars have plagued the world? How much blood has flowed into the rivers of the world? So can we truly say that there is no difference between people? Where is the unity which creates a common bond among human beings? To get the proper answer, one has to go deep into human psychology because true unity lies in the realm of the human mind.  -->

The extroversial mind of human beings, due to inherent Saḿskaras, becomes obsessed with and influenced by the external environment. 

A person influenced by the imposed Saḿskaras of the society may start to hate another person. But this hostility is something external.

Internally, all human beings feel a natural deep attraction for others. <!-- This attraction is the natural wont of living beings.  -->

Had there been no balancing force among the objects created by the Macrocosmic Mind, then the entire cosmological structure would have shattered into pieces. 
- The cosmological balance is maintained due to this attraction amongst the different objects and entities.

**From atoms and molecules to human beings with developed consciousness, all entities feel attraction for one another.** 

He keeps all the finite entities bound to Him by His inscrutable Cosmic Love. All entities drift in the vast divine flow as the minute manifestations of the Supreme Lord.

They are entitled to Cosmic Love by birth.
- **That is why attraction is the law of nature**. 
<!-- Attraction is not negative repulsion, rather --> 
- Repulsion is negative attraction.

The so-called differences that between human beings in the external world are merely expressions of negative attraction.

For differences to occur, people must enter into some sort of relationship with each other. 

**Without close proximity, there cannot be any friction.** 
- A serious difference of opinion today may be changed into friendship tomorrow.

<!-- Ábád kare vivád kare suvád kare tárá.
[The same people who quarrel today may rejoice together in common friendship tomorrow.] -->

In the past, people who remained engaged in bloody battles over religious issues reunited after the battles were over. 

Similarly, on language issues also there were numerous clashes. 
- But after some time, the mutual bickerings were forgotten. 
- As result of synthesis, a new mixed language emerged. 

**Thus, instead of reacting to apparent differences, one should seek internal unity.** 

The various differences which split society must be removed in the interest of collective welfare. 

One must look for the common link, the points of affinity, in the multifarious lifestyles and diverse expressions of life. 
- **The points of affinity have got to be encouraged by all means.**
- **The differences must be discouraged.** 

If the various differences such as customs, manners, food, dress, language etc. are given undue importance, the clashes and conflicts will increase. 

If those differences are made to unite forcibly, that involves risk. 

That is why we will have to adopt a positive approach rather than a negative one.

Thus, our policy is **“Aspects of unity should be encouraged. Aspects of disunity should be discouraged.”** 

If this principle is strictly followed:
- human unity will increase
- human disunity will decrease 

**No difference lasts long.**

So if the aspects of disunity are discouraged, the human society will gradually find a universally acceptable link through mutual association and attraction. 

In the interest of social welfare and unity, fissiparous tendencies should never be encouraged. 

Whenever differences arise, it would be wise to ignore them.

<!--  If at all something should be said, then one should say that this is not the proper time to bother about petty differences.
 -->

<!-- , causing severe damage to humanity. -->
