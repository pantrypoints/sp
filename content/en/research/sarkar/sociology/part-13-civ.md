<!-- Modern minds are often perplexed by the fear and doubt of the extinction of the human race within a short period. People deem that civilization is passing through a very critical phase and there is no possible escape from its total annihilation. But this can’t happen. -->

Both individuals and society are dependent on 3 factors for their existence:

1. Asti (existence)

Examples are dwelling place, food, clothing, education and medical facilities

2. Bhati

This means development and progress. The purpose of Bhati or development is the attainment of Ananda or bliss. 

3. Ananda as a Goal


<!-- The term Bhati means Vibhati or .  -->

<!-- The mere earthworm for instance, has existed for hundreds of millions of years, yet it does not signify existence in the true sense of the term. That is to say, there has to be Bhati, progress and development. Eating, drinking and being merry cannot represent a true life. It would be an encumbrance, a boredom.

For the all-round development of an individual or a society, a goal is needed. 

But for this determined goal the direction and purpose of development will remain confused. A bud blooms into a flower; this is what you may call its development. --> 


The term Ananda connotes infinite happiness, the equipoise of pleasure and pain, the perfect mental peace.


### Asti

The absence of any of the aforesaid factors may cause a great consternation or convulsion in individual or social life. The earth came into existence tens of millions of years ago. 

Though from the archaeological point of view it is still in its infancy, one day or the other it is bound to meet its Waterloo. This will naturally mean the extinction of the human race. Is it so?

The destruction of a particular planet or solar system does not mean the end of the human race. 

There are many other stars and planets in the universe. 

With further development of science and by the help of inter-planetary rocket systems, human beings will move to other planets.

What is a dream today will become a reality tomorrow. It is the inherent desire of an individual and the collective body which takes a concrete shape. 

It was an age-old desire of human beings to fly in the sky like birds. The aeroplane was a product of this desire. 

Desire is the mother of action. In coming days, you will see such rockets which may enable human beings to travel to other planets. 

And if one day these planets and stars also perish people will move to other planets. 

Some say that the thermal death of the universe may occur. In the absence of external heat, the universe may cease to exist.

<!-- It may also be argued that a day may come when due to constant radiation of heat and light the temperature of the entire universe may become the same, that is, .  -->

This means that humanity will also perish. But this cannot happen.

There cannot be a thermal death of the universe. 

his is because the solidification of the object will result in Jadasphota.

Tremendous heat will be released due to the Jadasphota or exploding apart of a planet. New galaxies and stars will be formed out of it. 

There is therefore, no cause to fear. So you can be sure of Asti.


### Bhati

Bhati, as Social development, needs 6 factors. 

1. Spiritual ideology in individual life and collective body. 

Much of your energy is misused due to the ignorance of your own self and the destination towards which you are moving. This misuse of energy is bound to cause destruction.

2. Spiritual cult, a Sádhaná process. 

Everyone has a physical structure. The problem with every individual is to produce more and more ectoplasmic stuff by the body and then to convert it into consciousness. 

There should be a proper process for this conversion. Spiritual cult consists of the conversion of the five rudimental factors into ectoplasmic stuff and then into consciousness through a special scientific process. 

This is a process of metamorphosis. Spiritual cult therefore, is indispensable. But only spiritual ideology and spiritual philosophy will not do.

3. A blending of existence and progress <!-- Asti and Bhati is --> as a socio-economic theory. 

There should be a priori knowledge regarding the social structure, the distribution of wealth and its growth.

For lack of this knowledge, there cannot be a solid ground for the construction of the social edifice.


4. Social outlook

All living creatures in this manifest universe are the children of the same Cosmic Entity. They are the progeny of the same Supreme Progenitor. Naturally they are bound in a thread of fraternal relations. 

This is the central spirit. A socio-economic theory is of no use but for this fraternal feeling. The implementation of this theory is an impossibility without Sádhaná.


5. Its own scripture.

There is a need for the company of elevated persons (satsauṋga) in all spheres of life.

The authority whose contact means satsauṋga for you is the shástra. That which elevates society by dint of sháśana is called [[shástra]]. We should have a shástra of our own. 

6. Its own preceptor.

The entire social structure depends on these 6 factors. The weakness of one among them may jeopardize the very existence of Bhati.
