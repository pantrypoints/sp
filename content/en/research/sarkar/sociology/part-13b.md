From ancient times many groups of people came into existence. Some of them somehow managed to drag on, some became extinct and some continued to exist in a metamorphosed form. 

Around 1,500 years ago, the Arabs were very developed in science. But they were defeated by the Islamic wave because:
- they lacked the 6 factors
- Islam had 5 of them. 

Egypt was fully developed in art, architecture and science. But they collapsed because of the lack of 6 factors. 

<!-- It is the Egyptians who made the pyramids which needed subtle geometrical knowledge. Moreover, they were also very advanced in the sphere of civilization. Despite this, they could not prevent their defeat. Today’s Egypt is the Egyptian form of Arab civilization. The cause of the death of its older form was the lack of the aforesaid six factors. -->

The Christian or Roman civilization <!-- was also considerably higher on the ladder of development. Yet they were --> lacked:
- social outlook. 
  - There were no feelings of fraternity and equality. 
  - The slave system was rampant and human feelings were on the wane. 
- lacked a proper socio-economic theory
  - This generated a fascist mentality in them. 
  - Those rolling in luxury and adverse to labour became indolent. 

Naturally they were defeated by a stronger and more strenuous force. 

The destruction of the Greek and Chinese civilizations was also caused by the lack of the factors of Bhati. 

The Aryans could defeat the indigenous Indians who lacked a preceptor. 

 <!-- only due to the latter’s lacking in the factors of Bhati. They had several factors of Bhati but there was no preceptor and hence they were defeated. -->

In the future also, for want of the six factors of Bhati, the extinction of a concerned group of people is sure to happen. 

But where these factors are present, there the movement is to wards Ananda or divine bliss, and due to this movement the chance of their elimination becomes nil. 

Such groups which have the six factors in their possession will be able to produce Sadvipras. Sadvipras are those whose all efforts are directed towards the attainment of Ananda. 

They are also conscious of Asti and don’t lack in the six factors of Bhati. They are strong in morality and are always ready to wage war against immoral activities.

Tapah Siddhi is an impossibility without the 6 factors of Bhati.

Those who strictly adhere to the principles of morality, are ensconced in Tapah, and are ready to wage a war against immoralists are sadvipras. 

Only those Sadvipras are safe from destruction and extinction who can work for the welfare of the human society. Therefore, it becomes the prime duty of all people to make themselves and others Sadvipras. 

By Sadvipra it is not meant those who practice Mala-Jap or Pranayama. 

Pranayama also has 3 stages:

1. Purak means to inhale
2. Kumbhak which is to hold the breath
3. Recak means to exhale

The Pranayama of the Sadvipras will be to:
- inhale the entire universe in Purak
- keep it within in Kumbhak
- exhale it after mixing it with their own greatness and good will in Recak


Sadvipras will wage a ceaseless struggle against immorality and all sorts of fissiparous tendencies. Those who pose as Dharmic but are bashful with the spirit of fight cannot be called Sadvipras. 

Shiva was great because his Trishul was always ready to strike at the immoralists. 

Krishna was great because his arrows were meant to curb the anti-human and immoral elements. 

He also encouraged the moralists to wage war against the immoralists. They were not only Sadvipras but also the parents of Sadvipras – the great Sadvipras.

These Sadvipras are always busy in the task of promoting the elevation of human beings. When this earth will become old they will lead human beings to other planets by directing scientific endeavours.

Some people fear that atom or megaton bombs may one day cause the extinction of the human race.

But such fears are ill-conceived and meaningless. 

It is human intellect which is responsible for their production and so naturally intellect is superior to its products. 

It may one day invent such weapons which may render ineffective even atom or megaton bombs. 

The cry for disarmament, therefore, will strengthen the destructive capacity of the atom bombs. It may lead humanity towards it total annihilation. 

It is, therefore, a great obstruction, an impediment in the progressive development of the human society. 

We need more powerful weapons than atom or hydrogen bombs. Sadvipras will manufacture such powerful weapons. 

If the human race is to survive, if millions of innocent lives are to be saved, it becomes the duty of the apostles of peace to utilize more powerful weapons than what they have at present.

Sadvipras will never lag behind in making scientific experiments. When the earth will become uninhabitable for human beings they will shift them to other planets.

Food shortage is not a new problem. 

Only Sadvipras and not the politicians and experts can save the world from it. They will produce such tablets which will be substitutes for food grains. By making a useless fuss over problems one will not ease the trouble. 

The spirit to fight against all odds alone can solve the problems confronting human beings. March ahead and wage war against all difficulties, every impediment. 

Victory is sure to embrace you. Difficulties and encumbrances cannot be more powerful than your capacity to solve them. You are the children of the great Cosmic Entity. Be a Sadvipra and make others Sadvipras also.
