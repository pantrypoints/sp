## Microvita 

Calcutta, 1989.  During the usual workers' meeting philosophy session, Baba asked me a new question: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Birth, death and reproduction are the signs of animation.  What is the status of microvita in the case of animation and inanimation?
{{< /l >}}

(The General Secretary waves at me. I step forward.) 


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Positive microvita are most important in the evolution of animate entities—as they tend toward consciousness. Negative microvita play the leading role for inanimate entities. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
**Positive and negative microvita influence living beings. Life is dormant in inanimate entities.**

Positive and negative microvita can only function on the periphery of inanimate entities. Otherwise, positive and negative microvita have no direct relation with inanimate entities. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Now I understand. Neutral microvita have the dominant position in inanimate entities. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Can inanimate be transmuted into animate? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Yes. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
What is the covert role of microvita in the process? How does Cosmic Mind guide the process?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
The Cosmic Mind does not act directly, but through the medium of microvita. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Does Cosmic Mind take the help of microvita? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Yes. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
**Microvita are created in the introversial [subtlification] phase only**.... You made a very good effort. (He points at His forehead) 

You should go on thinking deeply to get the final answer.... Now come forward. (I do so. He places His hand on my head. An indescribable blissful feeling fills  my head, and then runs down and up my spine.) He's a good boy. Yesss.
{{< /l >}}


The reporting finished after a few minutes. I then immediately sat for meditation. 

Though the feeling He gave me continued during meditation, my wandering thoughts related only to our conversation. 

It occurred to me that inanimate entities consist of neutral or dormant microvita. The inanimate entities are gradually converted into animate entities by the effect of a smattering of positive microvita naturally emanating from Cosmic Mind. 

Two weeks later. Hsinchu, Taiwan. It was 3:00 in the morning. 

The Margis had gone home only thirty minutes before, full of my stories and  Tantric talk. Only brother Yatindra and I were left in the yoga house. 

I desperately needed to sleep, but since Yatindra (a scientist) was eager to discuss more about microvita, I thought it would be rude to disappoint him. 

Though my eyes were closed and I was reclining on the floor, I  went on trying to answer his questions, my mind constantly slipping in and out of waking consciousness. 

Suddenly my body uncontrollably bolted upright. I was blasted awake. 


{{< l a="Yatindra" >}}
What happened, Dada?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
I don't know. As I drifted in and out of sleep, my mind shifted into  super-drive without warning and I understood something I never understood before. Something perhaps no one except Baba understood before.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Yatindra" >}}
What is it!
{{< /l >}}


Yatindra was even more excited than I was. 


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
**Animate and inanimate are not interchangeable with sainchara and prati-sainchara.** 

I can see this great misunderstanding existing among our Margii philosophers. We always thought that:
- sainchara [crudification] was the creation and evolution of inanimate objects like ether, air, light, liquids and solids
- prati-sainchara [subtlification] was the evolution of animate entities like plants, animals and humans. 

But:
- sainchara is really the evolution of physical matter
- prati-sainchara is the evolution of psychic entities or unit minds. 

The association of a unit mind with a group of physical cells is an animate entity. But the matter of those so-called animate cells is actually still in the sainchara phase*. It is the unit mind alone which is in the prati-sainchara phase."
{{< /r >}}


{{< n n="This is **so wrong**. The cells are already alive and in prati-sainchara. This is because those cells are made up of carbon atoms which are in turn made up of microvita. Since microvita can only be created in the prati-sainchara phase, **then it follows the carbon atoms are also in prati-sainchara**. The non-carbon atoms, like hydrogen, helium, and iron, are in sainchara.">}}



{{< l a="Yatindra" >}}
But that's completely different than what we've always imagined!
{{< /l >}}


<!-- "Wait," I said, looking more carefully at the revelation still erupting in my mind. I talked at locomotive speed, while Yatindra took notes.  -->


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
When a human being practices meditation, he may convert the most subtle physical cells of the body into mind stuff*— this is one of the turning points from sainchara into prati-sainchara, from matter to mind. This is possible because the unit mind of inanimate matter is dormant. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< n n="Again. This is **so wrong**. If one of your cells gained an independent mind, then it would become an outsider, a foreign organism. It would be like creating a bacteria from your own cells! A person can 'get' microvita by tapping into existing positive or negative thoughts that he gets from the cosmos -- he does not create it otherwise it would violate conservation laws" >}}



{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Microvita also have minds and bodies. Their minds are in the prati-sainchara [subtlification] phase.

Their bodies are in sainchara. The bodies of bigger microvita are made of smaller microvita, but  ultimately when we get down to the smallest constituent microvita, we find those having no solid or liquid body, only mind with a luminous body. Even those luminous microvita bodies are in the sainchara phase, while their minds are in prati-sainchara. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
In the case of inanimate entities, the minds of the microvita constituents are inactive/unexpressed/dormant/neutral. In the case of animate entities, the microvita minds are predominantly active, and those active microvita minds are either positive or negative. 

To speak of a microvita as being positive or negative means that the mind of that microvita is positive or negative—not the body*. To speak of a human being or a goat does not mean their respective bodies, but rather the human mind or the goat mind. The associated bodies of microvita, human beings and goats are all physical entities moving in the sanitary phase. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< n n="The body of the microvita is only necessary for perception. We perceive the crude microvita more easily than subtle ones.">}}


<!-- If you powder down atoms then you get microvita. If microvita could be powdered down, you would get idea. -->


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Sainchara and prati-sainchara are functioning within each and every animate entity on varying levels. In a single human being there may be billions of separate entities independently  evolving within both sainchara and prati-sainchara.*

Positive and negative microvita affect unit minds, and unit minds affect their  associated physical bodies. In that way, the body of an animate entity can become diseased or cured of disease by microvita. 

Microvita do not directly affect those bodies, but rather, the minds associated with those  bodies. The individual atoms and molecules which serve as the building blocks of a living cell remain unaffected by positive and negative  microvita. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< n n="In the body, only the elements are in sainchara. The living parts are in prati-sainchara as a whole" >}}


{{< r a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Just as a ball circling on the end of a string has both centripetal and centrifugal force (depending on one's perspective), so sainchara and prati-sainchara come into existence simultaneously. They cannot be separated from each other.

This is why there is no conflict that microvita (whose minds are created in prati-sainchara) serve as the components or building blocks of saincharic matter. But those microvita serving to make up inanimate objects must be predominantly neutral.* 
{{< /r >}}


{{< n n="Wrong. In inanimate objects and inorganic matter, there is no microvita." >}}


Yatindra threw down his notes, yelled, "Baba!," jumped up and started dancing around the room. 

Perhaps this is the beginning of what Baba meant when He said to me, "You should go on thinking deeply to get the final answer."*

{{< n n="Dharmavedananda made this whole mistake because he was thinking about microvita shallowly by 'drifting in and out of sleep'. This is the opposite of thinkng deeply. This is why he was bolted with such false information on microvita." >}}



<!-- One more small but interesting thought also occurred to me: Baba directed many of His books to be compiled into different series. For example, all His books and articles on Prout come together to make  about 1400 pages of Prout in a Nutshell having over twenty volumes.

Similarly we've got Nutshell series on Microvita, Neo-Humanism, Ananda Marga general philosophy, and so on. Margis often comment, "Only Baba could call this number of volumes nutshells." Now I understand: He titles them nutshells because He wants us to think deeply, 
research and thoroughly expand His ideas.
