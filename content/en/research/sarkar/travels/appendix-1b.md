<!-- Valencia, Spain, 1979.  -->

Culturally and historically, Iberia was not a part of the Roman empire.

The creation of the Moors' society was a reaction to the western part of the Arab movement. 

The northern portion of Saudi Arabia up to the northern part of Palestine was Arabia. 

The Arabs:
- were nomads and heathens.
- had no faith in God
- were intellectually backward. 

But they were highly developed in astronomy, astrophysics, algebra and math because the land was desert and they needed to learn to follow the stars.

Around 1,400 years ago they became Moslem and gave up the Semitic culture. 

**Originally the Arabs and Jews were one culture.** 

The Arabs were heathens, whereas the Jews knew a little of God. 

Some of the Arabs became Christian 2000 years ago. 
- 1369 years ago they became Moslems.

They expelled the Jews from Palestine and adjacent places. 
- The Jews became homeless, transported to different countries like Great Britain and the Soviet Union. 

After occupying all of Palestine, the Arabs spread:
- to the north to Yugoslavia.
- to the east to the Philippines
- to the south, past Ceylon to the Maldives Islands
- to the west they came to the Atlantic, crossed northern Africa, the Sahara, Egypt, Sudan, Tripoli, Tunisia and Morocco.

They destroyed the original Egyptian culture. 
- Those were the Egyptians who knew the science of the preservation of dead bodies. 
- The present Egyptians are not the descendants of those ancient Egyptians. Rather they are a transplanted Arab population. 

After the western march, they commenced an eastern march.
- 75% of that eastern march was stopped in India.
- That is why it resorted to waterways through islands up to the Philippines. 

The march could not go to China and Japan. 
- It was checked forever. 
- When the Spanish occupied the Philippines they stopped the Arabs. 

In the southern march they could not go past the Maldives Islands.

In the  northern march they proceeded up to Yugoslavia. 
- There the movement stopped due to extreme cold climate, where they could not show bravery and valor.
- Similarly the Germans were defeated when they attacked the Russians in the winter. 

In the west, the Atlantic Ocean stopped the Arab march. 

From Morocco they went north through Gibraltar to invade Iberia. 
- They wanted to move to the Bay of Basque.
- But it was difficult to cross the Pyrenees Mountains. 

They could not occupy Portugal because the Arab navy was very weak. 
- The Portuguese were strong. 
- The people of Iberia had to fight by tooth and nail.

The Arabs who came from Morocco were known as Moors. The western march stopped after reaching Spain. 

Islam was restricted to these boundaries of the world.

You will have to preach Ananda Marga southward of Gibraltar-just the opposite course of the Arabs. But you will not preach through the sword. 

Your message will be spread through love and social service. Love is a stronger weapon than the sword. 


## The Dodos

Here there are left only a few certain marks of the Arabs in the cultural life. 

Otherwise the Arab presence is no longer here. Now they are as dead as the dodo. 

The dodos were a pigeon group which came to certain islands in the Arabian Sea where there were no humans present to kill them. Therefore they lost their capacity to fly.

Their bodies  became bulky, as they had no need for self-defense. When people from  other countries finally went there, they caught ready meat just with their 
bare hands. The last dodo died about too years ago. Anything which is fully dead is now called in people's English dead as the dodo. 

## The post-Moor culture in Spain

What was the influence of the Moors on Spain?

The main population of Iberia is Caucasian of Mediterranean offshoot, with close proximity to the Italians and southern French. Their color is  white—not reddish-white like the Germans. Their hair is black, not gray-black like the Germans. The brownish-black skin and hair is from the Moors.

You will hardly find such a man today in Spain. In the anthropological life of Spain, there is little influence of the Arabs. But in  the language there remain a few distorted Arabian words. 

Finally the original land of the Moors was occupied by the French. It became a colony. 

Strengthen yourselves in north Africa. We will attack from Spain with love. But we shall say to them we are not your born enemies. They may say, 'We hate you.' We will say, 'We love you.'
