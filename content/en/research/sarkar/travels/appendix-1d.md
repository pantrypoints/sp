Calcutta, 1989. 

Baba explained how Bangladesh, one of the world's  poorest nations, can solve its problems.

First analyze the country's raw materials. 

It sells untanned hide and  raw jute (fiber for rough cloth) in the international market. 

It has virtually no metallic materials and very little underground fuel such as raw gas. **The best system for such a country is barter trade.** 

If Bangladesh were to process the hide and jute itself would its economy improve? These processes are complicated and costly, so it would not be useful.

Also, synthetics are rapidly replacing both raw materials. 

The jute industry is a sick industry because it cannot easily compete. 

Many producers have closed, and the government has been forced to subsidize the industry. 

Thailand also produces jute, but its jute is superior.
- Thailand is not an underdeveloped nation. 

Previously, England processed Indian jute in England itself. 

After Indian independence in 1947, England could no longer purchase jute from India, so they created synthetics.

Therefore, Bangladesh must change its industry. 

Japan is importing raw materials from around the world. If those countries become politically conscious, they will stop exporting to Japan. 

This will happen in the near future. 

Orissa is exporting manganese and iron ore to Japan, but they will soon stop. 

Rice can be easily grown in Bangladesh.

Suppose it stops jute and increases rice production. Will that solve their problem? 

In that case, Bangladesh will become self-sufficient in food, but will not have any basis for international commercial transaction. 
- This will deprive it of many basic needs. 

Some advocate that jute should be mixed with  artificial materials and wool.
- The jute stem can be used to make nylon. 

These approaches are still only the best of a bad lot. 

The time for growing jute is from the end of winter to the end of the rainy season.

Only sesame, perhaps linseed also, can be grown then.

These have a big international market and can also be used to make petroleum.

But this is not the immediate solution. 

**Jute must continue in the short term, but only that amount which is needed for local industries.** 
- Raw jute should not be exported. 
- Only finished products should be exported. 

To solve the problem, developmental projects should be initiated which are based on the availability of local materials. 

Some propose the widespread establishment of coconut plantations. 

The salinity of the soil in Dacca is insufficient. 
- But palmira or tal (palm) can be grown. 
- Coconut grows nicely in Nokali district. 

**Plastic can be manufactured from the husk.** 

Jessore and its adjacent areas are also good for coconut. 


Non-ferrous industries can be developed. 

There is some gas and oil available, but not much. 

From where should the power come? 

Hydroelectricity is not possible because rivers are in the delta stage. 
- They must be in the hilly stage, and must have sufficient force. 

To avoid flooding, they should have many dikes like Holland, and fully utilize the water. 

The very wide rivers we see now are due to deforestation and the stripping away of vines. 

So large banks must be constructed, and massive reforestation done. 

For now, power can be derived from ocean tides and from solar energy. 

Ocean tide energy is tapped where rivers enter the ocean.
- It is cheap and efficient.

Solar power facilities are not  yet sufficiently developed, but will become more efficient soon. 

There is not much possibility to obtain thermal power—the coal is too young. 
- It needs another 800,000 to one million years.

**But at that point human beings will no longer live on this planet.** 

Bio-gas production will help solve the problem of manure, which is also a chronic problem. 

Horticulture is also good. 

(He gave many details concerning beans, jackfruit, mango, etc.) 

Crops of the tropical zones are good. Temperate  zone crops are not suitable. The quantity of fish has decreased because there is insufficient rotting materials due to deforestation. 

Before there was about 2400 square kilometers of forest, but now it is less than 1000 square kilometers. (Perhaps I misunderstood Him on these figures.) 

Bangladesh needs large-scale reforestation and preserves. 

Pineapples need 60 inches of rainfall per year.

The average in Bangladesh is 80 inches except in one region. Pineapples give food and also material for making cloth.

Litchis and silk are both good. Cotton is not suitable. 

Mulberry wood is good for producing sporting goods and also rayon. If  mulberry wood is hardened, it becomes hard as iron, and can be used in construction.

There can be production of banana chips, dried fruits and  washing soap. By burning banana leaves enough sodium bicarbonate can be manufactured to serve the world. 

Just to distract the unsophisticated population from the government's lack of proper planning, the government excites the people through non-issues, like declaring Bangladesh a Muslim state. 
- This happened at the time of the epic flooding. 

Proper planning will not become a reality until the voters are educated. Even if they do not become politically educated, at least they should become politically conscious.
