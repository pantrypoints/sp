Dadaji is here for his second visit. Again, plenty of people are attending the lectures and learning meditation. 

One man, about 50 years old, came to our door, saying:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I saw the sign on your house: Ananda Marga Yoga Society. What does it mean?
{{< /r >}}


He had never heard of yoga. I took a few minutes to explain a little to him, and he immediately wanted to learn. 


{{< l a="Dharmavedanda" >}}
I think it'll be better if you first attend a lecture and read some of  our books. You don't know what you're getting into.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Man" >}}
But this is my only chance. Tomorrow I go out of Jackson for one month. Please leave the risk to me.
{{< /r >}}


Hesitantly, I agreed to schedule a meeting with Dadaji. 

Immediately after his initiation he did long meditation—nearly 1 hour.

Then he came to me and said:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I must see Dadaji again.
{{< /r >}}

"I'm sorry, Dadaji's doing his own meditation now, so you'll have to wait." 

{{< r a="Man" >}}
But I have an appointment; I can't wait. I've got a problem with the meditation.

From the first moment, my meditation was very pleasant. But after some time, a tall bearded Indian dressed in white appeared in my mind. He  demonstrated the sitting position of the Indian which was a yoga posture for doing higher meditation. 

I was doing meditation on the mantra which I learned from Dadaji. But the Indian man in my mind was loudly repeating a different mantra.

<!-- At least let me explain it to you." "I'm not qualified to deal with these matters." 

"Look, you've got to listen!" I shrugged my shoulders.  -->

He told me the "different mantra". It was strange and unknown to me.

{{< r a="Man" >}}
A conflict rose in me. I didn't know which mantra to use. 

It created a heavy tension, which was painful. 

Finally, I decided that since my meditation had led me to the vision of this Indian man, I should follow him. So  I started repeating his mantra. Immediately I felt wonderful, as I've never felt before. 

Do you agree that I am doing the right thing?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
I think you should continue only with the mantra you learned from Dadaji. I believe this vision is coming from your distant past.  Perhaps from past lives.

But I'm not sure, so please telephone me tonight, and in the meantime I'll ask Dadaji.
{{< /l >}}

Dadaji agreed with me. So when the man called, I suggested he continue to  follow Dadaji's instructions only. 


Next day.

The man I wrote about yesterday is a traveling salesman who sells equipment to farmers. Tonight he called again saying,

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I'm finding the meditation experience too taxing. That Indian yogi still appears every time I sit and loudly chants his mantra. What should I do?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
As we already told you, please keep on struggling.
{{< /l >}}

Next day. The salesman called again late tonight. 

{{< r a="Man" >}}
As usual the yogi entered my meditation this evening. This time, however, it was absolutely hellish.

He applied such a power on me that it seemed unbearable. Somehow I continued with my mantra. Just when I thought I would explode if I continued even one second longer, he exploded! 

His clothing, flesh, blood, even bones burst apart in every direction-nothing remained except a bright blissful luminosity. It was beautiful beyond words. I felt that all my worries and fears were gone. Did I merge in God?
{{< /r >}}


Two weeks later. 

The salesman called me again.

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I feel guided. Almost every farm I go to I find either the husband or the wife is particularly interested in meditation. And so I teach him or her the universal mantra 12
{{< /r >}}


Now I understand why this man had such difficulties in his meditation—to strengthen his mind for the work of reaching these farmers who would otherwise never come in contact with Ananda Marga.
