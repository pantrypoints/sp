Two days later. In the early hours of the morning, while everyone was sleeping, my trainer left.

No one knows where he's gone, or at least no one says. 

Ten days later.

3 days ago my trainer left India. 

While departing, he announced his intention to get married. It seems that he's been planning this move for a long time, having already arranged his passport and visa. 

The Dada who had tried the most to help him commented to me:


"Many times I told him not to engage in self-aggrandizement. He had such a bloated ego—he thought he knew more than anyone. 

In Tantra, such people either see their mistake, or they make even bigger blunders. 

For a short time he'll be sky-high happy. But when he comes down on his feet again, he'll feel he cheated himself. He won't be content unless he does full-steam meditation and social service.

That sort of lifestyle is a full-time commitment. It can't be adjusted with a family. His only path is to be a monk." 25


(Author's afternote: Many persons come and go on the spiritual path. Even after a few years of effort some Margis may give up their spiritual practices. They may continue to accept Ananda Marga as an excellent way. but they do not have the strength to continue. What is the cause? Some believe our most important practice is meditation. Others think it is service. Still others think that the key lies in the balance between these two. And there are others who say that the only guarantee lies in following all the disciplines, though I do not know anyone who does that.


<!-- 25 The fact that a senior Dada engaged in deception and violated his vows is no cause for doubting spiritual ideology. The way of Tantra is sometimes very difficult. The path cuts deeply through narrow-mindedness and selfishness. 

While self-realization and strength to serve the society grow ever greater, the consequences of making mistakes also grows. To continue moving past countless temptations and also past all one's inevitable mistakes, the only saving grace is found in the humility cultured by devotion or love for Guru. 

That humility does not allow superiority or inferiority feelings to develop. By thinking T know myself. I shall never fall from my path', aspirants fool themselves. They are in great danger because they depend upon ego. Whereas those who think—I know nothing, I only want to do what Guru or God wants me to do—they rise higher and higher after getting up from each fall. But these humble ones do not know they are higher. They know nothing. -->

The Tantric organization provides the structure for everyone to try their best, and allows 
aspirants to err again and again if they are willing to admit their mistakes and try to rectify 
themselves.

My trainer had entered the "third stage" of spiritual development at the time of his 
downfall. 

1. Stage 1 is when one feels difficulty to concentrate, and also may be challenged by his or her family or friends.

2. Stage 2 is when some concentration is achieved, and a little bit of bliss is experienced.

Obstacles are more internal than external.

3. Stage 3 is when one-pointed concentration enables the aspirant to achieve some occult power, but the mind is not yet merged in the infinite entity. 

I quote one of Baba's writings: 

{{< box >}}
There is quick progress in this third stage. But there are strong possibilities of degradation also. At every step one must move with vigilance. 

In this stage the spiritual aspirants acquire some occult powers which may be dangerous after a certain progress.

There is every chance of misuse or abuse of those occult powers as a result of which onedegenerates.... 

The realized persons say that the spiritual path is as sharp as the razor's edge, it is really inaccessible'. 

Human beings will have to move on, but in this stage they cannot move a step forward unless and until they develop a high-grade conscience. 

For this they depend solely on the grace of the Supreme.... In this third stage, if there is devotion, one can easily move forward without any difficulty: but a person who has no devotion, whose heart is as dry as a desert, will find it impossible to progress.

4. In Stage 4, one's mind becomes inextricably concentrated upon the Supreme Being.

Then all psychic problems cease, and only external difficulties confront the aspirant. 

But there is no possibility of downfall because the thought of Guru is constantly present. Baba writes about 
this stage: 

{{< q a="Baba" >}}
When a person attains an exalted state of spirituality, he or she can bring welfare to millions of people, and they can do so due to the grace of the Supreme Consciousness.

I noticed that the acharyas who gave up their acharyaship and the Margis who stopped practicing meditation had one thing in common: **they did not regularly practice kiirtan when they were alone.** 

By meditation or by social work one may develop the ego of accomplishment or of failure.

Whereas kiirtan, the singing and dancing to Baba nam kevalam, is free of egoistic ambition. It is a purely devotional practice. It is a dance of surrender to Guru and God.

My trainer hardly ever sang kiirtan. He used to say, "Only those who are weak-minded need kiirtan. My meditation is very powerful, so I don't require such singing." 

But Baba says otherwise: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The nucleus of devotion is not to be found in the heart of the dry yogi. Rather it is located in the hearts of those who are practicing kiirtan.

If you want to develop devotion, when you have 30 minutes time for spiritual practices, spend 20 minutes in kiirtan, and 10 minutes in meditation.
{{< /l >}}


Some say, "It's alright to do kiirtan. But it should be natural and unforced. I do it whenever I feel like it." I think that is a mistake. 

Kiirtan is the means to receive inspiration.

So it is most beneficial to perform especially when one is depressed or otherwise not inspired.

Silent meditation is a hundred times more valuable if it is begun with a clear and happy mind.

That's why kiirtan is a must before meditation, unless the environment does not permit it.

If, after doing kiirtan for 10 minutes, you still do not feel uplifted, continue it. It may take 20 minutes, or even 30 minutes.

But eventually it works because it reminds oneself again and again: there's nothing to worry about—everything is only the expression of cosmic love.]
