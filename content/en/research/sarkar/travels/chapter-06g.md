Wellington. Our visas expired in Fiji, so we are back in New Zealand. 

We are receiving reports verifying that all of our workers and outstanding Margis in India are either in jail or in hiding. I continue my work, confident that everything will happen according to His wish. 

Christchurch. On the bus today I thought, "What is the use of working like this unless I can see Baba? If I can't see Him in India, then I've got to make Him come here... I'll fast until He comes to me.

I know He's got the mystic power, and if He wants to use it, He can easily do so." So I stopped eating or drinking from that moment. If I die or get sick it's His fault. I have every right to see Him.

But I will continue all my normal work, and not tell anyone. If my higher 
authority comes to know, he might order me to stop the fast, and I would be 
compelled to comply. 

Nelson. The first day was a normal fast. But the second day was heavy. 
Today, my third day, the body seems to have adjusted a bit, and it's not so bad. 
Of course I'm damn thirsty. Anyway it's no problem for me. Let the suffering 
come, let sickness come—it will just speed up His coming to me. 

Auckland. Fifth day of the fast. Baba's very clever. The more I want to 
suffer, the more He protects me. Five days now without water or food. Some 
people would have died by now but I don't feel bad at all. It's impossible. 

Though my body's okay, my mind is wild with thirst. I've been having 
uncontrollable visions of waterfalls during meditation. 

What's He doing? Why doesn't He come? 

Anyway I'll fast to death if He refuses me. That will teach Him nicely not 
to play with me. 

Due to my traveling, nobody knows I've been fasting so long. Everywhere 
I go, the Margis think that I'm doing only a one or two-day fast. 

Wellington. Eight days now. You'll be in big trouble. Lord, if I die. It will 
cause all sorts of complications here, and I don't care. You're to blame. 

You have to come and see me. 

But there's one problem: I'm not suffering enough. Though my head 
constantly hurts and all the parts of my body have shrunk, I still don't feel 
anywhere near to death. Actually it's a bit of a drag. Just at the time that 1 don't 
want protection, that Trickster is somehow fortifying me. 


But I'll out-trick Him in the end. 


Next day. I was wrong. He's the master in hocus-pocus. Of course. 

The full-timer answered the doorbell this morning. The person at the door said, "Namaskar. I don't know why, but I suddenly got a strong feeling from Baba to fly here for a surprise inspection." 

He laughed and entered the room where I was sitting.

It was my higher authority who had been in Australia for the last 9 months.

On seeing me, he was shocked. He immediately understood that my state of mind and body were far from normal. 

"So ... my Lord ... you're the cause. You must be the reason why He told me to come here." His voice was sharp.

"What are you doing to yourself?" 

"You're doing long fasting, aren't you? How many days already?" 

"Eight," I said. 

"With or without water?" 

"Without," I smiled. 

"Baba! You're crazy. You could've died. What's the purpose of this?" 

"That's my own matter." 

"Buddha fasted 40 days, and he still couldn't get realization. You idiot. You won't get anything except very sick." He asked me to please stop. I refused. 

Then, as I feared, he formally ordered me to break the fast. 

I didn't get exactly what I wanted. But I did confirm for the umpteenth time 
that He does have omniscience, and He does have power, but He uses it as He 
sees fit. Not according to our wishes or demands. 

And I did find out that this body has the capacity to fast without water much longer and much more easily than I expected. Contrary to Dada's forecast about my getting sick, I feel completely healthy—better than in a long time.

This may be useful information for the future when different catastrophes hit our little planet, and we cannot get the food or water we think we need. Even then, those of us who have sufficient mental power can continue serving humanity.
