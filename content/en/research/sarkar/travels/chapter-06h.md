Tonga Island. My responsibility in the South Pacific Sector is coming to an end. I will be transferred to another sector. In the meantime, I've been directed to travel through the South Pacific islands, ending up in Hawaii, where I will be sent a ticket to Denver.

Since the Emergency  began in India, Denver has been functioning as our temporary Central Headquarters #2. 

Two days ago I arrived in Tonga, which is less touched by "civilization" than any other place I've visited. 

I'm staying in a thatched hut with a family of 13. Usually one member of each large family has a job. The rest enjoy their simple life at his expense. 

And enjoy they do. Many of the adults are child-like, playing games all day. 

They have no sense of personal property. If anyone leaves a bicycle outside a shop, he can expect a new caretaker will assume responsibility for it by the time he comes out of the shop.

If a car is parked for a few minutes without a guard, all of its removable parts will be efficiently removed by the time the driver returns. 

Almost every evening they ceremoniously pass around a coconut shell filled with a slightly intoxicating liquor made from a root like cassava. 

The ceremony gradually breaks down as singing, dancing and other sorts of  pleasures take over. Their songs are sung in four or five part harmonies, the dances are rhythmically perfect, and as to the other pleasures—well, that's when I always go for a stroll. 

Though the people are simple, some are interested in meditation. 

I've initiated a few, and have been watching to see their sincerity. 

Late in the afternoon I went to the beach to meditate with one of the new initiates, a 19 year old. 

During our meditation, the sun set. Mosquitoes came upon us in huge swarms. 

Though tolerating their attack, I briefly opened my eyes to see how my friend was doing. His nearly bare body was now clothed with a layer of mosquitoes, yet he sat stock-still. We remained another 
half hour. 

As we left the place, I asked him, "How was your meditation?" 

"S'was allrait. S'was verry good." 

"What about the mosquitoes?" 

"Dem was sommmm probalam. B' God was greater." 


### The king pushes his weight around 

Today being Sunday, I went to church.

I had heard the king regularly attends a particular church, so I chose that one, hoping to get an eyeful. 

Until then, the closest I'd got to him was the sound of his daily motorcade, that is, the  sound of scores of car horns blaring. Wherever he passes, the people make the same comment: "Da kiin's gonna i'spect 'is pigfaarm!" Then they roll on the ground with laughter. 

I was able to get a front row seat, immediately below the royal balcony. 

Shortly before the service started I got my eyeful alright. He's renowned as the fattest king in the world, well over 400 pounds. He was so big it seemed he could not support his own weight.

While walking and huffing and puffing, he was assisted on either side by attendants. 

The king is a devout Christian. He noticed me last Sunday because I received today an official notification that I must leave this island within 24 hours because the king wants only Christianity propagated in his land.

Though I'm not  teaching religion, my turban and orange uniform do create a sectarian appearance. 

He's clever. He waited all week to have the notice delivered to me at 6pm today.

It's Friday and all government offices are closed tomorrow so I'll have no opportunity to appeal within the allotted time limit.

All of my new friends are outraged but are helpless. The king is stubborn. No one knows what to do. 

Out of desperation, a radio interview was arranged for me tonight, to publicize the injustice of the  leave-order. 

The disc jockey himself was upset with the king, and gave me a full hour on the air. But when the program finished, he shrugged his shoulders, then embraced me and wished me well in my travels. 

### A nice Vice 

Western Samoa. While traveling to teach meditation and yoga, I never stay in hotels. If I have no place to stay, I remain in a congested public spot, and wait for a sympathetic person to offer me a spot in his house to spend the night. Even if someone wants to donate money for a hotel room, I gratefully refuse. One way or another, I eventually meet a noble person, and it invariably leads not only to a comer on the floor for my blanket, but also to someone keenly interested in spiritual development. And he or she usually introduces me to others with similar interests. My real purpose, which is not to eat and sleep, is thus automatically fulfilled.

Facing such a predicament here, I took my stand in the midst of a busy 
crowd in the central marketplace. After two hours a young lady approached 
me. She was about twenty years old. 

"Sir, is there any way I can help you?" she asked. The quality of her 
English showed she was well educated. 

"I am a teacher of meditation and yoga," I said. "I want to meet people who 
are interested to learn, and, as I've just arrived, I also have no place to stay." 
Usually I come right to the point. 

"My father has always been interested in such things. Let me introduce you 
to him I'm sure he'll also offer you a room." 

She led me to her car. So she was not only educated, but also at least a little 
wealthy. 

Her house was so big I could not see where it ended. Walking past the 
servants and through several rooms, we reached the library, where a large, 
bulky man sat reading. He looked up as she entered and smiled. When he saw 
me, his smile broadened. 

"I've brought you a yogi, Daddy," she said. 

He rose and offered his hand, "1 am thrilled to meet you, sir. I've been 
waiting for your visit." 

Introductions were made. Among other things, he mentioned that only two 
years ago he had completed his term as the Vice-president of Western Samoa. 

These three days were packed with engagements. My host introduced me 
to scores of the country's upper-echelon who were keen to learn yoga. Most of 
them had health problems, for which I prescribed yoga asanas and appropriate 
diets. Some of them, including my host, are already improving. 

The most exciting programs often come last and then end prematurely. 
Today I received a telegram ordering me to leave immediately for Denver, 
from where I shall travel to my next posting: Europe.
