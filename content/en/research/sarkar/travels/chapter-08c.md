This is my first visit to Bergen, Norway. Last night I stayed in the flat of brother Trond, a friend of a friend. 

He turned out to be a bit 'different'. It was late when I arrived and he was keen to go to bed, so he let me sleep on the floor where I put my blankets.

 <!-- showed me a couch where I could sleep. -->

<!-- Since I never sleep on a soft bed, I instead arranged my blankets on the floor in the corner of his bedroom.  -->

I was sleeping deeply with a cover pulled over my head when something woke me up. 

I felt a pressure on my leg, but could not identify its source. 

Instantly I regained full alertness. Now I was both curious and anxious. 

The pressure was relieved, only to be felt again a moment later on my waist. 

Then, the pressure still against my waist, a second unstable pressure came directly on top of my body. 

Surely it's a person. At first he was walking around me, and now he's walking on top of me! Whoever it was must not have been expecting anybody to be lying on the floor. 

<!-- Though it may be my host simply sleep-walking, I thought, it's more likely a 
thief moving in the dark.  -->

He took another step, this time on my shoulder. I lay there, unmoving, and thought out a quick plan. 

<!-- Now! I thought, my heartbeat quickening.  -->
Quick as a flash, I sat up simultaneously thrusting the blanket off. 

"Uhh!" he exclaimed, clearly shocked that he had been walking on a person. He bucked off of me. I saw his eyes widen in fright as he ran toward the door. Without losing a second, I grabbed my pocket knife from my nearby shoulder bag and dashed after him into the adjacent room. 

Our scuffle created quite a noise. My host sat up in his bed. "Hey! What's this? What're you doing?" 

Instead of replying, I shouted to the thief in the most threatening tone I could muster, "Come out! I know you're here!" I couldn't see anyone in the darkness. 

"What?" Trond yelled. "Who is it?" 

I turned on the light and looked all around. Nobody. But there were only the 2 rooms.

There was no way he could have gone out the door of the flat. 

"It's a thief, or something!" I said to Trond who was still sitting in bed. 

Holding the knife tightly in my fist, I threw aside the curtains, the chairs, tables, everything the thief might use for cover. Nothing. Nobody. 

I was dumbfounded. By now Trond had come into the room. I told him in detail what had happened. 

"Do you have any explanation?" I said. 

"No. It's pretty strange. Maybe you imagined it all." 

"Impossible. After feeling his first step, I was wide awake." 

"Odd..." 

"What? Did you ever experience something like this before?" "No, no. Surely not." 

With nothing further to speak about, we awkwardly went back to our respective sleeping places. A few minutes passed. 

"Ah, Dada," he said softly. "In fact something out of the ordinary did happen to me a few nights ago. I was asleep when I was awakened by someone pressing my body in different places. I threw my blanket off, and saw someone jump away and run into the other room." 

"But that's exactly what happened to me!" 

"Well...I...I don't know... Nothing to speak about. Let's go to sleep." 

He refused to talk any more. 

This morning, while I was doing meditation, Trond left the house. 

After meditation I walked into the second room and looked around. Middle-class conservative furniture...a small orderly collection of books...a few slightly gaudy decorative items...and—wait a moment—I looked at the titles of his books: History of the Occult, Science of Magic, Psychic Power Unleashed, Hitler and the Spear of Destiny, Dictionary of Necromancy, and many more titles referring to the black arts. What kind of a person...? 

Surely the fellow was dabbling in occult power. That might explain last 
night's phenomena. 

The being who walked on me last night was not human, not even physical. That's why he could disappear when I chased him. 

It seems my host may have developed some psychic power, though it's clear he was not in control of that power. He, too, was affected by it. 

On one hand he didn't want to talk about it, but on the other hand he wanted help. 

Because he did not confide in me, however, and because I have to leave today, it will have to remain an unsolved riddle—at least for now. I could help him, but only if he asks. 

Unfortunately there must be countless other people like him, playing with dangerous powers, hardly knowing what they are doing, learning a few spells and concentration techniques and materializing latent forces from their subconscious minds before they have the morality, purity and mental strength 
to control themselves. 

What to do? Nothing, except to continue to develop spiritual and social qualities. At the proper time society will need and demand the expression of such God-centered qualities.
