Later I got a chance to ask one senior worker how everyone tolerated Baba's abuse. 

He said. "We know from Tantra's long tradition that the guru has the responsibility to uplift his disciple from animal-life to warrior-life to divine-life. 

To achieve this, the guru's behavior will have to fluctuate between extremely bitter and extremely sweet. And it varies for each disciple. 

"More importantly. Baba instructed us how to deal with subordinate workers. He said that for every ten parts of strictness we use, we must give at least eleven parts of love. In His case I feel like all the strictness He employs cannot compare with His boundless love. 

Baba's existence is only for us. He does nothing for Himself. It doesn't matter if 
someone else believes I'm right or wrong about Baba, because that's my daily 
experience. That's why no amount of severe punishment can shake my 
relationship with Him." 

After the Dada left I remembered a story I had heard about Swami 
Shivananda. One of his disciples once asked him a question, "Guruji, your 
teaching is beautiful for all of us who are practicing yoga and meditation. Your 
mission also benefits thousands of sick people who come to our medical 
clinics. But what about the rest of the human society, the millions and billions 
who suffer from poverty, ignorance and injustice? Can you not do something 
for them? Can you not please guide us to help the entire society?" 

Shivanandaji answered, "We must only help the rest of suffering humanity 
indirectly. To serve them directly would require a vast organization which 
would crumble under its own weight. My workers would quarrel with each 
other and destroy whatever was created. No, I am not the man to do that work." 

I believe that Baba's greatest contribution to history is the creation of a 
Tantric organization to serve the entire human society, an organization based 
on renunciate workers. Because renunciates prefer to live outside of normal 
social disciplines, the subtlest psychology is required in training us. More 
importantly, we have to overcome our petty differences. We have to move 
together as one great family. For this purpose. Baba belittles our egos by 
chastising us, and encourages our souls to unfold by loving us. 

Awakening latent qualities 

I did not have to wait long for my own personal experience. Today I, too, felt 
the touch of His stick. BABA: What is your post? 

ME: Regional Secretary, Stockholm and Oslo Regions, Baba. 

BABA: How many new kindergartens or primary schools did you open in 
the last one month? 

ME (feeling very proud): Two kindergartens. Baba. 

BABA: And in that same period how many permanent welfare centers did 
you start? 


ME: Ah, none. Baba. 

BABA: Do you think the number is adequate? ME: 

No, Baba. 

BABA: Are you proud of your work? ME: 

No, Baba. 

BABA: Should we all praise you? ME: No, 

Baba. You should punish me. 

BABA: Yes, you deserve punishment. Hands up! (I raise my hands. Baba 
strikes me on my right side. I am surprised by the intensity of the pain and 
jump slightly.) Are you properly utilizing your time as a worker? 

ME: No, Baba. (As He goes on hitting, I involuntarily think. Baba loves 
me. He is doing this only because He cares for me. Both my mind and body 
settle down as I look into His eyes. Instead of reflecting anger, those eyes are 
compassionate.) I will do better, Baba, much better. 

BABA: What does he say, GS? 

GENERAL SECRETARY: He says he will do much better. Baba. BABA 
(switching over to hitting me on my left side): This reply is not sufficient. 

ME (Though the pain is real, I feel my mind diving deeper into Him.): I 
shall work every second of every minute, Baba. (More blows) I will not think 
for my own petty self. I will become an ideal man. 

BABA (turning the edges of His mouth upward, His cheeks dimpling): GS, 
he does want to be a good boy. Yes. (Waving His stick toward the side of the 
room) Go, stand there on the side. 

I went and joined the Dadas who had already received treatment. 
Amazingly, the intense pain was almost completely gone. Rather, I was feeling 
overwhelmed with the strong desire to serve humanity to my utmost capacity. 
And my affection for Baba was so strong that it seemed to be physically 
pressing out against my breast. 

Right, not wrong 

Mahindra used to serve as one of Baba's bodyguards. When he heard that I 
had just begun to experience the stick, he told me a story from the time that 
Baba was in jail: 

My old friend, Awadhanath Prasad begged me to arrange a meeting with 
Baba. He told me he had done something bad with a lady who worked in fields under his supervision. He had committed other sins too. 

When we entered His cell, Baba immediately yelled at Awadhanath, "Why did you come? Animal, pig!" 

"I came due to Mahindra." 

"Mahindra, why did you bring this nasty boy?" 

"Baba, please help him." 

"Bring me my stick." 

I looked around cell but I couldn't find Baba's stick, so I borrowed 
the constable's and gave it to Baba. Right there in front of prison guards, Baba 
beat Awadhanath. Then He told him to rub his nose on floor, which he did until 
it bled. 

Afterward, when we went outside, the 
CID [Central Intelligence Department! wanted Awadhanath to file a case against 
Baba for beat-ing him but he refused. "He is my guru! What He did was right, 
not wrong!" 

After that he became a completely pure and exemplary man. He now spends all 
his spare time doing social service. 

Power comes from difficulties 

Margiis and workers are present from all over the world. Just think! When Baba 
was arrested in December, 1971, there were Margiis in 
only five countries. Now, seven years later, Ananda Marga is active in 
over eighty countries. 

The Tantric guru and his disciples always gain power from their difficulties. 
Every effort made by the Gandhi regime to destroy Ananda Marga eventually 
resulted in strengthening our mission. 

This reminds me of two statements Baba made while still in prison. The first 
was during the emergency rule, when He was convicted by a kangaroo court 
and sentenced to life imprisonment. In that seemingly darkest of moments. He 
turned to His attorney, smiled, and wrote on His message board: "Now the 
tables will turn." 42 Soon after, Indira Gandhi lost her power, and our workers 
and Baba were vindicated. 

The other occurred at the end of the emergency, when the ban against 
Ananda Marga was lifted and our workers were released from jail. Many of them had undergone great suffering. This was especially true of those who the authorities had physically and psychically punished in an effort 
to obtain written denunciations of Ananda Marga. Baba's comment at that time 
was "The workers have passed through the blazing crucible. Their iron has been 
forged into steel. Previously they (Gandhi and others) believed Ananda Marga 
to be a dangerous baby snake. Now, thanks to them, it has become a fully 
grown snake." 

42 For many months during His imprisonment, due to the after-effects of his poisoning, Baba 
was unable to speak; H e communicated by writing. 


Stockholm. After working as the Scandinavian regional secretary for nearly 3 years, I have now been transferred. My posting is to a section which previously did not exist outside of India: Volunteers Service Department or SD. 

Today I begin my duties as the European Chief Secretary of SD. The programs of SD include physical social services for the needy, survival training, security, relevant higher philosophy, and training in basic service-skills such as first aid. 

Among the means for providing this training are weekend SD camps, which also encourage collective discipline and unity through group exercises. In addition to all of this is a sub-section called Spiritualists' Sports and Adventures Club. 

I think I'm going to enjoy this new job.
