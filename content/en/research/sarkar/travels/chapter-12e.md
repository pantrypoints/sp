Just before evening darshan, several Indian avadhutas and I were together in Baba's room when He said, "I am now going to tell a story. But I prefer to  speak in Bengali. If I were to tell it in English, it would lose some of its charm and much of its humor. Do you mind, Dharmavedananda?" 

"No, no. Baba, of course I don't mind." 

"Good. Afterward, Vijayananda will translate the story for you." 

I did get the translation, and will explain below. But during the talk I had 
my own experience. 

Baba was in a chair, while we sat on the floor at His feet. He was served a large glass of lemon-water. A cloth napkin was tucked under His chin, which made Him look a bit child-like. Since I did not understand much of what He said, I paid attention only to His physical actions. As He spoke. He gradually brought the glass closer and closer to His mouth. Just as He was about to drink. He said something which made the Dadas laugh. He also laughed and brought the glass back down without drinking. Continuing. He again moved the lemon-water toward His mouth and just as He was about to drink, He came to another funny line and, laughing with everyone. He again brought the drink down. He did this repeatedly, which made me laugh every time. At the end of the story, the Dadas 
were laughing so hard that some of them were rolling on the floor holding their 
sides. At last He brought the glass to His lips and, giving me a wink, drank the 
entire contents. 

The story was about His army days before India's independence from Great Britain. 

(This translated version is missing many of the subtle Bengali nuances and all of His body-language)

Since Baba was a corporal, the privates in His platoon frequently complained to Him about their 
selfish sergeant. The food the privates got was very poor, while the sergeant ate well and never shared a crumb with them. 

One day. Baba said to the sergeant, "Sir, I know this jungle area well. I passed part of my youth nearby. I want to advise you that there are dangerous jackals roaming here. They are capable of killing a man.""


Opening his eyes wide, the sergeant said, "What shall we do? Are there any precautions we can take?" 

"Generally these jackals attack in the middle of the night. Before attacking, however, they make a slight coughing sound. If we hear that sound, we must not alert the animal to our presence by moving. Do you understand?" 

"Corporal Sarkar, I depend on you to get us through this region alive." 

"Don't worry. Sir. For maximum security, it will be best that I sleep in your tent." 

"By all means, please do so."

That night Baba slept next to the sergeant. About 3:00 in the morning, Baba 
woke him up, and whispered, "Listen." 

"What is it?" exclaimed the anxious sergeant. 

"Shhhh, quiet," He said. A soft cough could be heard. "Is it...?" 

"Yes, it's surely a jackal, He whispered. 

<!-- "Oh God! In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit..." 

"Quiet," hissed Baba.  -->

Another sound was heard. 

"I say! What's that?" said the sergeant. "It seems he's entered my supply 
tent!" 

"Shhh, quiet, Sir, please." 

Then a clicking sound. 

"By God, I think he's getting right into my tiffin box!" "Sir. you'll give us away," whispered Baba. "What ho! I can hear the rustle of my bag of channa chura (spicy snack)!" 

"Do keep quiet. Sir." 

"I say! It sounds like he's taking my satchel of dried fruits and nuts!" 

"Sir, please." 

"Oh Lord, I'm sure that's the sandesh (milk sweets)!" 

"You'll get us killed, Sir." 

"Oh heaven save me, the cakes!" 

Baba grabbed his shoulders, whispering, "Get a hold of yourself, Sir! You've absolutely got to hush up. Don't even move." 

The sergeant lay there, unmoving. But his eyes were filled with horror 
hearing the sounds from the supply tent. At last, there was silence. Ten seconds, 
twenty seconds... 

The sergeant jumped up, saying, "He must be gone! I'll just see..." He ran out. 

"Oh, Mother Mary!" he yelled from the supply tent. "That jackal's taken 
every last drop of my eatables! God damn him!" 

Baba walked in, saying, "Sir, really. How can you care for such a small matter, when here we stand alive?" 

"Oh damn, damn, damn. You're right, but..." and mumbling beneath his breath he went back to his tent. 

Baba looked in, saying, "Sir, better I survey around, to ensure the creature's really gone." 

Then Baba went to the privates' tent to join them in their well-deserved feast.
