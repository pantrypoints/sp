In the evening some of the local Margis came. As usual, a large procession formed, accompanying Baba to the airport. But this time He was not traveling on another leg of the journey. He was leaving us. 

I was so involved in the arrangements that it again slipped my mind that the final moment was approaching. I remained busy until Baba began the passport check. Though I was not flying, I somehow managed to enter the passengers-only area. 

I walked next to Baba in silence. As each moment passed, I became more 
heavy-hearted. 

Finally, He and the others entered the gate to board the plane. I forced myself to smile at Him. He smiled back and gave a slight wave of His hand. Then He turned the comer and was out of sight. 

I walked some distance to where I could be alone and cried. 

Next day. In the mid-morning, completely exhausted from the tour, I 
sprawled out on the floor and fell asleep. Dada Vedaprajinananda told me 
afterward, 

"When I walked by what I thought was a near-mindless Dharmaved- 
ananda. I was surprised to hear you talking in your sleep. You called out. 
'Where can we take Baba tonight for fieldwalk?' 

"Just for fun I decided to answer you and said. We can take Him along the 
Rhone River,' thinking that would be the end of it. 

"But, still sleeping, you replied, 'No, we can't take Him there. He was there 
yesterday!'" 

Today Dada Kamnananda told me, "When we were still in the Milano 
airport, but it was clear that all our efforts would go nowhere and that we would 
surely be deported, I asked Baba: 'Baba, they don't allow us. What we should do?' Baba said, What can we do? We will go back.' 

Then He put His hand on His nephew Paltu's shoulder. He weS a bit tired and said, "There's nothing wrong with the people of Italy. There is something wrong with the government.' I said, 'Baba, I'm so sorry. We could have organized better for You.' 

But Baba said to me. What did you say? Sorry? Why sorry? You should never be sorry. When I was leaving Bombay I decided that I would give thirty-five discourses during this tour. The thirty-fifth discourse was completed last night in Lyon. So I knew that I would not be able to speak further in Verona. Still I came here up to Milano airport. And I am going back from here. There is some reason why I came and why I am going back."' 


### Confirmation of Baba's 'guess'

Two weeks later. Mainz, West Germany. The news from Italy: Today 
brother Markendeya and a few other Italian Margis completed their efforts to 
find out the cause of the deportation of Baba's tour group. At an early stage of 
their investigation they were able to confirm that the original request for the 
deportation had indeed come from somewhere inside the religious institution 
named by Baba. 

The official in that institution who conveyed the request to the Italian 
government told them he had only performed his duty, and did not know the 
reason. He was ordered to do so by a higher religious official. The Margis then 
met that higher official. He directed them to an even higher officer from whom 
he had received his order. This upward relay continued until they were led to an 
inner circle around the supreme authority. At this point they were told by the 
very highest official they met. "I am sorry. I am not permitted to give you any 
more information regarding the source or the reasoning behind this process
