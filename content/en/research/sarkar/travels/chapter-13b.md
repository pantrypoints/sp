Two days later. Even though we had 2 days to prepare, we were still anxiously making last minute arrangements when Ramanandaji called.

"There's been another change," he said. "We will come tomorrow." 

[Author's note: I later heard the story behind Baba's delay. That morning, Baba and His entourage were in transit at the Copenhagen airport. Without visas, they could not come out to meet the Margis. By the goodwill of the immigration authorities, however, a special exception was granted, and the Margis were able to enter the transit area to enjoy His darshan for two hours. 

The plane took off for Reykjavik. But after 30 minutes in the air, the captain announced that difficult weather conditions had suddenly developed. 

The flight was diverted to Oslo. 

I think the highest kiirtans of Europe are found in Oslo. I had wondered why Baba chose not to visit there. 

Of course, the group had no visas to enter Norway. All the Dadas expected to either stay in the transit hall, or otherwise follow the instructions of the airlines. 

Baba, however, was of a different mind. Without consulting any of them, He headed for immigration. 

One of the workers said, "Baba, excuse me, we have no visas for Norway, so it will be of no use to go through immigration. 

We might try to speak to the highest authority here." But Baba paid no attention. He simply stood in the passport line. Their protests unheard, the others also fell into line. When they saw the officer stamping an entry permit in Baba's passport everyone was astonished. They could hardly suppress their laughter as one by one they were all similarly admitted into Norway. 

Just after the last Dada's passport was stamped, however, the officer seemed to wake up. 

"Wait a moment," he said. "Let me see your passport again. ... What's this?

There's no Norwegian visa! No no, this is very bad. All of you Indians, give me your passports back." 

"Ah, but we have friends here in Oslo," said Dada Ramananda. "Before you cancel the visas, allow us first to call our friends. Perhaps this can be straightened out." 

"This is highly irregular," said the officer. "Wait here." 


A higher official was approached, telephone calls were made, and several unbelieving, shocked Margis came to the airport. As the negotiations proceeded. Baba sat with the Margis and gave a mini-darshan. 

Eventually it was decided that Baba, Ramanandaji, and Didi Ananda Prajina would be permitted to enter Norway. The others would have to stay in a hotel arranged by the airlines. 

The exuberant Margis and their three guests drove to the house of 2 Margi couples:
- Manohar and Jyotsna
- Abaniish and Hansa

When Baba entered the bedroom where He was to stay, the bed was still unmade from the previous night. It seemed He could not have cared less and was in good humor. 

That evening scores of Margis packed into the little house. Though the facilities were unsuitable for Baba to give darshan, the air was full of excitement and devotion. 

The next morning Baba returned to the airport. In the airport itself He gave darshan for 1 hour, thus fully satisfying everyone. (Even the Dadas who had stayed in the hotel were satisfied, having convinced the airline officials to grant them free of charge "a few short" international phone calls.] 

### Spiritual motivation only

Baba fixed Iceland as the site for the only DMC program in Europe during His tour. 

Iceland is perhaps the most difficult point for European Margis to reach. It is certainly not considered a resort island. 

Moreover, there are fewer Margis in Iceland than in most other European countries. Though He hasn't explained the reason, we guess that there must be a spiritual cause. 

Certainly there is something distinctive about this island of the midnight sun. 

Some mystics have written that Iceland is one of the earth's highest energy centers. Though I feel they may be right, I don't really know. But at least Baba did say this island is one of the few portions of the ancient land of Atlantis which is still above water. 

This reminded me of a story about Baba from some years back. A rich Margi had a personal problem and desired Baba's help. When he was admitted for personal contact, he secretly carried with him a substantial quantity of gold, thinking to offer it to Baba. When he entered Guru's room, he was shocked. 

Rather than sitting on His bed as usual, Baba was sitting on a huge pile of gold coins. Baba said. "Do you think your riches mean anything to me?" 

<!-- The values of the common person and a Tantric guru are quite different.  -->

Upon returning from field walk Ramanandaji noticed some blood on Baba's foot when he was taking off Baba's shoes.

"Baba, what is this? When did You get injured?" 

"It has been troubling me for several days." 

"But Baba, You didn't mention it before." 

Baba did not reply. Ramanandaji picked up the shoe and looked inside. He 
found a nail protruding from the sole. 

"Baba, look at this nail! Why didn't You tell me? We could have fixed it or 
gotten new shoes." 

He smiled. "I did not want to disturb you." 

"So You destroyed Your foot! Oh, look at it! There must have been so much pain. Now You disturb me anyway! You should have told me the moment the problem came!" 

Still smiling. He said. "Recently I absorbed a large quantity of samskaras while giving personal contacts. 61 It was necessary that Prakriti 62 express at least a little something in the balance. If I had informed you of the nail in my shoe, you surely would have eliminated my discomfiture. But then Prakriti would have had to devise another form of compensation." 


### Secret connection 

A dozen workers were in Baba's bedroom today, laughing our heads off at His jokes. 

At one point. He looked at Dada Rudreshvarananda, who is French by birth, and started speaking in his mother tongue. 

Rudreshvaranandaji literally rolled on the floor in laughter. Later I came to 
know that Baba was making absurd comparisons between the objects and the people in the room. This French session went on for perhaps 10 minutes.

61 Here Baba refers to the fact that during personal contact He relieves disciples of 
certain samskaras, (reactive momenta or unexpressed reactions) which most impede 
the individual's spiritual development. 

62 Prakriti is commonly defined as "Nature." More precisely it is the operational prin¬ 
ciple causing Cosmic Consciousness to express itself. 

Afterward I asked Rudreshvaranandaji, "How was Baba's French pronunciation?" 

"Better than my own. Baba spoke with a perfect Paris accent, whereas I 
was raised far outside of Paris. I think even His vocabulary exceeds mine." 

"But how could He know so much French?" 

"He surely has a secret direct connection with the Cosmic Funny Bone," Rudreshvaranandaji replied.
