Wales, United Kingdom. 1980.

Today at the breakfast table, I commented to some Margis:

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
Perhaps I have a special blessing from Baba. In the 9 years I've been working for Ananda Marga, I've never missed a train, bus or plane. Even when I arrive at the station late, the trains and buses in those cases are also late.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Margi Woman" >}}
What's the explanation for this, Dada?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
Well, it's surely not my own power. If I weren't working for dharma (righteousness). I'd miss the bus just like anybody else. Simply speaking, the Cosmic Force protects those who serve It.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Margi Woman" >}}
How about some more apple pie, Dadaji?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
Sure, thanks
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Karun" >}}
But, Dada, there's no time for more pie now. Your train for Liverpool leaves in just 20 minutes.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
No problem.
{{< /l >}}

I ate the pie at a leisurely pace.*

{{< n n="This is the corruption that affects people in the spritual or religious path" >}}


We left after about 10 minutes. Since we were late, Karun drove me by motorcycle as fast as he could. 

Still, we arrived 1 minute past the scheduled departure time. We sat down on the platform to wait for the late train. 

Five minutes passed in pleasant conversation. Then as one lady walked by, I asked:

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
Excuse me, do you know how late the train to Liverpool is?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Lady" >}}
It's not late. It came on time and left on time
{{< /r >}}

I was shocked.

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
What? How can that be?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Lady" >}}
I think it's not unreasonable, sir
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Karun" >}}
Dada, there's always a first time, you know. I told you not to eat that pie.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
No! [jumping up] There must be a way. Excuse me again
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
[running after the same lady] Do you know any other way to Liverpool? I've got to be there by 6:00 this evening for a lecture.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Lady" >}}
Well, my husband sometimes takes a morning bus to Liverpool. But that's  surely left by now.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda">}}
We have to try! Where does it go from?
{{< /l >}}


It leaves about 7 kilometers from here. Straight down that road. But I tell you, it's already too late.


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Thanks! Let's go, Karun!
{{< /l >}}


I pulled Karun onto the motorcycle. Even as we rode off, he protested at the  futility of it. 

{{< r a="Karun" >}}
I tell you, that pie did you in, Dada. Apple pie yanked you off the path of Dharma!
{{< /r >}}


About 3 kilometers down the road, we spotted a bus on the side of the road. 

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Stop the bike!
{{< /l >}}


I ran to the bus. and leapt inside. 

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Is this bus going to Liverpool?
{{< /l >}}


The driver had his head underneath the steering wheel, and was trying to see something. 


{{< r a="Bus Driver" >}}
Don't bother me, buddy
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Please, just tell me, are you going to Liverpool?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Bus Driver" >}}
We will, damn it, if this bus ever gets going again.
{{< /r >}}


I laughed.

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Don't worry. I'm sure it will start soon.
{{< /l >}}


Just as I said that, he turned the key and the engine roared. 

As the bus drove off, I stuck my head out the window. 

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Thanks for the pie!
{{< /l >}}


Karun yelled at me:

{{< r a="Karun" >}}
You lucky stiff!
{{< /r >}}


Ten days later. Oslo, Norway.

I was busy until late last evening, reviewing  the meditation lessons of a few Margis. Abaniish knocked on my door. 

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
You're going to miss your train to Stockholm, Dada.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
I never miss. Don't worry.
{{< /l >}}


By and by, I got ready. Once in the car, Abaniish drove like mad. When we arrived at the station, Abaniish and the other Margis jumped out and ran. I walked.

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
Dada, hurry up!
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Baba will take care
{{< /l >}}

But just as the platform came in sight, the train pulled away. 

I stood there flabbergasted. 

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
Dada, why didn't you run?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
There's no time for talk now. Where's the next stop?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
Well, Lillestrom. But it's too far away. It'd be out of the question to try and catch up with the train.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
I don't care! We've got to make it.
{{< /l >}}


I ran toward the car. Abaniish laughed, and came after me slowly. When he finally got to the car, he said. 

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
There's no way, Dada. Just admit you missed it.
{{< /r >}}

But I insisted, so reluctantly he drove. All the way to Lillestrom he kept saying:

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
This is crazy. It's impossible! We're just wasting our time.
{{< /r >}}


But I  pushed him to drive faster. 

25 minutes later, as we came near the Lillestrom station, we saw the train also approaching.

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
I can't believe it! It's like a movie!
{{< /r >}}


As the car screeched in, I threw the door open, sprinted to the train, and jumped in, out of breath. 

Then, anti-climactically, the train remained there for a few minutes. The Margis jogged up, clapping their hands. 

{{< r a="Abaniish" >}}
Congratulations, Dada. Any parting remarks for the fans?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Dharmavedananda" >}}
Yes. Though we Dadas may not have to worry about catching our trains, it's still better to arrive early.
{{< /l >}}


Due to their laughter, perhaps they didn't hear me add. "I got your message. Baba. Twice in ten days is enough."
