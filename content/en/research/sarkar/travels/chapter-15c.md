Yesterday Dada Parameshvarananda arrived from the Philippines for dharma samiksha. He had been suffering from leukemia for a number of months.

The doctors had declared it incurable, though they did not say how much longer he would live. 

Three days ago, on the day of his planned departure for India, he fainted and did not recover for several hours. By that time, his office secretary had canceled the flight reservation. When he regained consciousness, Dada became angry at his secretary. "Why did you cancel my flight? You should have forced me to wake up, and put me on the plane. I'd rather die in India than here." 

He flew the next day to Calcutta, suffering all the way. Though he had never asked Baba for anything before, this time he could not help but think. 

"Please, Baba, help this body." 

From the Calcutta airport, he took a taxi alone. When he arrived at the Central Office, he found Baba's Personal Assistant. Dada Ramananda, standing at the gate. 

"Baba told me to wait for you here and bring you to His room." 

"But how did He know I was coming just now?" 

"In the same way He knows everything," replied Ramanandaji, helping him upstairs. 

Dada entered Baba's room and prostrated. 

"How are you?" Baba asked. 

"I'm fine." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Yes, Baba. I'm fine." Thinking that Baba knows all, he saw no reason to express his problems. 

"Yes. Yes. Very good," said Baba. "Now I'm busy, so I will see you again later." 

Today it was Manila Sector's turn for general reporting. Paramesh-varanandaji came forward. 

"Yesterday," Baba said. "I asked this boy how he felt. He told me fine, even though this fool will die within 24 hours. He has a disease which is so advanced that it cannot be cured, and will kill him by tomorrow. 

(Turning His face toward Parameshvaranandaji. He continued) 

"Stupid, idiot, why didn't you tell me long ago about your problem? If you had told me even 6 months ago, I could have simply prescribed certain yogic postures and diet to cure the problem. Now, scoundrel, you are going to die." 


"Baba, please save him," "Give him another chance," said a few workers. 

For a moment. Baba sat in silence. "It is true that he has given his everything for my mission. He never cared for himself, only thinking for me. So ... Iam compelled to help him. In this case, medical science is incapable, impotent. The only means of assistance is spiritual power. Alright. I will save him from the jaws of death." 

Baba began lightly touching Dada with His stick. He gradually tapped it on every part of his body. At the same time, He narrated Dada's long medical history; how he had suffered from typhoid fever, another time from mild tuberculosis, and so on. 

Afterward, Paramesh-varanandaji told me that some of the diseases Baba mentioned he had forgotten, but all were 100% correct. 

"I always took care of him, though he didn't know it," Baba said. "In natural ways, I saved his life repeatedly. But this time, his irresponsibility is excessive and extreme." 

Baba held His stick against Dada's chest. For 40 minutes, Baba pressed the stick, not moving it from that spot. Dada later said that at that time such power entered him that he felt he could easily cross mountains. 

"Now I have purified his body. I withdrew all the cancer cells. He was scheduled to die within 24 hours. But his time has been extended. Within 10 days he will recover all of his previous strength." 72 


### Even Lord Shiva Never Did It 

Today Baba mentioned that dharma samiksha is a one-time affair. Dharma samiksha on such a grand scale was never done before by any spiritual master, and Baba will not do it again. 

He is showing a little bit of His meticulous guardianship and a little bit of His intimate knowledge of each and every Margi, personally and specifically, one by one. 

He said, "7000 years ago. Lord Shiva thought to conduct such a program, but never did it." 


72 From that moment, Parameshvaranandaji started feeling much better. Ten days later, doctors 
declared him fully cured. 

I wonder: why never before? And, even more curiously, why never again? Is it because Baba did not come to prove Himself to the world, but rather only to get His work done? 

Yes, even Lord Shiva never did it. This sentence expressing Baba's 
uniqueness could be applied to much more than dharma samiksha. I think of 
5000 songs...an organization of both renunciates and family people in almost 
every country of the world...the Prout movement...the systematization of 
Tantrathe mixture of intense spiritual practice with social action...His detailed 
guidance in many diverse fields.... Unfathomable. 


One of the Margis receiving dharma samiksha today was Rajpal, an Indian. 

At one stage of the analysis. Baba said. "You have a question for me, isn't it?" 

"Yes, Baba," he said. "About my son..." 

Though in that moment, Baba did not give him time to continue, he afterward explained to us that he intended to ask about the cause and cure of his son's attitude toward him. 

Almost since the boy's birth, the son had scorned and mistreated his father. It was Rajpal's greatest worry, because he dearly loved his son. 

Even though the boy began practicing meditation at the age of 14, he still expressed disgust toward his father. 

The problem was not a public one, and therefore Baba could not have heard of it. Nevertheless He said. 

"I know. I know everything. The world is mysterious. That which happens today may be the result of events occurring long ago. In your present life itself you will find the cause of your present trouble. 

Many years ago you took a 500 rupee loan from an old man who was not wealthy. But you did not repay that loan, even when the old man was sick. Do you remember?" 

"Ah ... yes ... Baba." 

"That old man was very angry at you. and he finally died still feeling angry at you. He was reborn as your son. So your son hates you. Otherwise his behavior is gentle toward everyone else. Now what shall you do?" 

"I don't know. Baba." 

"You must treat him very well. Give him solace whenever possible, serve him in sickness. Whatever he needs, give it to him. Beyond that, the only remedy is meditation."
