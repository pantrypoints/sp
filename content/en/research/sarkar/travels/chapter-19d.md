Calcutta. Dada Pranavatmakananda told me that on 2nd June, during a workers' meeting, Baba mentioned, "The panorama of the world is going to undergo a very fast change. You all should be ready...." 

Yesterday in Vishnupur, Pranavatmakanandaji said to Baba, "Three days ago You said the world's panorama is going to undergo a big change. Baba, in that time so much happened. On 3rd June, Ayatollah Khomeini, the revolutionary mullah of Iran died. On 4th June, Communism was voted out of power in Poland—the first country to reject it. 

Also on 4th June, when the military attacked the peaceful protesters in Tiananmien Square, Communism stood exposed in China as a system that can only be maintained by brute force. It seems that Your 
prediction of communism's downfall is beginning to be fulfilled." 

"You wait and see," Baba said. "The world will be dumbstruck to 
witness the pace of change. Before you reach your sector, there will be 
much more change in the world." 98 

### Real dreams 

Dada Pranavatmakananda toled me a story he heard from two other Dadas: Nityasatyanandaji and Haratmanandaji. They were both sleeping in the same room in Sao Paolo, Brazil, when Nityasatyanandaji had a dream: 

He was on a field walk with Baba. At one point, their way became 
obstructed by mud. Dada thought, "If Baba walks through this mud, His 
legs will become dirty." So he lifted Baba, carried Him across, and then 
put Him down. Then he woke up. 

He noticed that their room was full of a sweet lotus scent. He was so 
excited that he shook Dada Haratmananda to wake him up and asked 


98 Pranavatmakanandaji reached his sector a few months later. During that time, Communism 
collapsed in the whole of E astern Europe. 


him, "Do you smell anything in this room?" Dada replied, "Yes ... it's like 
a lotus flower ... very sweet." After this, both Dadas forgot about the 
incident. 

Nine months later, Nityasatyanandaji was in Calcutta. It was his 
daily routine to wait for Baba in the garden. When Baba would come out 
of the house, Dada would sing the latest Prabhat Sangiit song. One day 
Baba turned toward him and said, "If you had not lifted me that day, my 
legs would have become dirty." He smiled and walked away. 
Nityasatyanandaji was surprised. He went on singing but could not un¬ 
derstand what Baba meant. He remembered nothing. 

Two days later when Dada was returning to South America, he sud¬ 
denly recalled that night and understood Baba's words. He wept with 
love for Baba. 

At another time, Haratmanandaji was alone with Baba, massaging 
Him. Somebody had told him that Baba's navel area produced a special 
scent. When Baba was sleeping, Haratmanandaji lifted Baba's un¬ 
dershirt out of curiosity. Baba woke up and said, "Nonsense fellow! 
What are you doing?" 

Again He slept. More careful this time, Haratmanandaji lifted the 
undershirt. Baba woke up while Dada was sniffing. But this time He 
smiled and asked, "What do you smell?" 

"It's sweet, Baba." 

"Is it like a lotus?" 

"Yes." 

"Have you seen pictures of the mythological Vishnu which show a 
lotus sprouting from his navel, and on top of the lotus flower Brahma is 
sitting, creating the whole universe?" 

"Yes, Baba." 

"It is symbolic. Parama Purusha (the Supreme Consciousness) cre¬ 
ates all, and His nucleus, His creative faculty is the navel. As His navel 
produces a lotus smell, mythology shows it so. Do you remember this 
scent?" 

"What do you mean, Baba?" 

"Do you remember when you were sleeping in the same room as 
Nityasatyanandaji, and he woke you up? It was exactly that smell." It is 
clear that for Baba, our dreams of Him are also part of reality. 


### Lost in their own lies 

[Author's note as a background to today's entry: In 1982 the Tripura state government, at that time communist, tried to crush Ananda Marga. Some of their leading politicians openly stated they would "oust the socio-political organization Ananda Marga." Soon after, one of our primary schools was bombed. A court case was filed and the judge's decision went against us so we appealed in the High Court. At that time, the communists held 54 seats in the State Assembly out of 60. Most of the public used to treat Chief Minister Chakravorty like a god. How could we expect to win? But Baba said at that moment, "When the sinner reaches the climax point, downfall is certain." We sent 500,000 leaflets and 200,000 posters to this small state of less than two million 
inhabitants. Finally in the High Court, the District Magistrate apolo¬ 
gized for obstructing our school. The High Court instructed the police 
and the government agents to leave our school undisturbed. Not long 
after, the communist government was defeated by the Congress Party. 

The West Bengal government's (also communist) reaction to our 
work in Ananda Nagar was similar. In 1987, Baba told us, "The wind is 
blowing in your favor." He also said, "Complete every work immediately, 
as time is short." Highest priority went to developing Ananda Nagar. In 
short time, the near-desert scene dramatically changed. It must have 
terrified the federal and state governments to see Ananda Marga 
creating a beautiful community in one of the poorest areas of India. If 
we succeeded, it would prove the government's inefficiency and 
insincerity. The local communist party leader announced to the press, 
"Just as we drove out the Lutheran Universalist Mission, we will also 
drive out Ananda Marga."] 

In Ananda Nagar this year there have been almost daily attacks on 
our staff, destruction of our agricultural work or harm to our buildings. 
Ananda Nagar is about 1200 acres, and these attacks have mostly 
occurred on the outskirts. Four months ago, at midnight, the police 
destroyed one of our buildings, declaring it the property of the Forestry 
Department. The police claimed they seized weapons from Ananda 
Marga. We denied it. They often make such claims. We are compelled to 
repeatedly file court charges, and eventually always win. It seems a never-ending process. By now, the general people doubt any negative news published about us. In this case, our statement in the court was, "Why didn't the police destroy the building in the daytime, if it were 
really the government's building?" We won the case. 

The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu, became furious-he 
openly hates Ananda Marga. The step he decided on was excessive. 
Yesterday he approved an attack hoping to drive out Ananda Marga. The 
District Magistrate sent a message to Jyoti Basu, "If we raid Ananda 
Nagar, we can expect a fight just like the Sikhs waged at the Golden 
Temple." They sent 1500 police and 153 vehicles to Ananda Nagar. They 
even brought ambulances to take care of the wounded. Apparently there 
was so much propaganda against us for so long, that the opposition 
believed their own lies about us. They thought we had a huge number of 
machine guns and explosives. But what did this overwhelming military 
force find? Nothing. Nevertheless, in a press conference just after the 
raid, the police claimed they discovered numerous weapons. 

Today our Public Relations secretary filed a court case against the 
West Bengal government and police. In the history of West Bengal, no 
case was ever filed against top police officers. The PR secretary also held 
a press conference, and showed the police seizure lists which proved 
that they found nothing. The media representatives were astonished; 
they had published the false news only yesterday. Today they printed 
the true story. 

During the last few days of reporting, Baba did not sit with the rep¬ 
resentatives. Each time He comes back from field walk, everyone greets 
Him as He steps out of the car, then those who have reporting duty run 
into the main room to be ready in case He wants to take their report. 
Though we've regularly followed this procedure, our sense of despon¬ 
dency deepens as the days pass and He seems to ignore us. 

This morning there was a feeling of resignation among many workers. "Surely again He will not sit with us." Our crisp readiness was so 
absent that this time the main room was full of Margis and workers who 
were not supposed to be there, and no one had made any effort to shoo 
them out. 

Together with everyone else, I greeted Baba at His car. As He slowly 
walked away, moving toward the side entrance, one brother approached 
me. "Dada, I've completed the paper-work that you wanted me to do. 
Here it is." I was torn between going through the documents and going 
to the room, just in case this time Baba wanted our report. But if I didn't 
take the papers it might make trouble for this brother. I took the 
material and quickly checked it. In this way, perhaps a minute passed. 

Then I rushed toward the room. A mad scene was taking place at the 
door! Margis and other workers were scrambling to squeeze out, 
everyone trying to get out at the same time. Though I could hear Baba 
shouting inside, there was no way I could enter at that moment. A gap 
appeared, and I jumped forward, pushing violently against the others, 
and forgetting all politeness. Just as I reached the door those inside 
began closing it. I thrust in my arm, and then a leg, and with a burst of 
strength, pressed it open, and squeezed into the room. 

The very instant I entered Baba looked at me, burning me with His 
inner fire. As the last to enter, I was the most irresponsible element in 
this entire brew of feckless workers. But instead of hiding behind the 
others, I stepped toward the front. I love His attention, no matter what 
sort. 

"Nonsense! Stupid! Scoundrel!" He shouted at me. "Breeding chaos! 
Like animals! Idiot! Rascal!" I bathed in His force. "How can you waste 
my time? Don't you know that I am working twenty four hours a day?" 
His words stabbed at me with a power and a volume I had never before 
experienced. Surely even the neighbors could clearly hear His voice 
through the now closed door. The other workers turned their faces to¬ 
ward me, wondering how I would take this scorching chastisement. I 
suppose they thought me arrogant, because instead of bowing my head 
in abasement, I looked straight at Baba. He was dead right, I was some¬ 
times wasting my time and His time, but in that moment I did not care 
because Baba was directing a colossal force at me, and I did not want to 
miss a drop of it. 

He stood up from the sofa. A sinking sense of disappointment surged 
through the workers as they understood that this opportunity for a long- 
awaited meeting with Baba was spoiled. As He left the room everyone 
became gloomy and turned their eyes toward the floor. Every one, that is, except me. I was elated with the shakti, the spiritual power 
He had injected into me. But, knowing the others would not understand, 
I neither smiled nor said anything. I was, after all, the one deserving 
maximum blame. 

His voice echoed again and again in my mind: "Don't you know that I 
am working twenty four hours a day?"
