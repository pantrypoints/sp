<!-- All the other workers were doing meditation, and I alone guessed that Baba's door was wide open. I stood there for half an hour, looking at Him as He talked .  -->

Baba was in a fine mood, laughing and joking with Dada Keshavananda. Toward the end, Keshavanandaji gave Him a soft drink. Like a child, Baba wore a napkin tucked in at His neck, and sipped repeatedly at the plastic straw, enjoying Himself. 

I felt a change in the air, and knew something was coming.

<!-- , though they still talked lightly together.  -->

Suddenly, Baba began shouting loudly, and Keshavanandaji jumped up and ran out of the room, calling the Central workers. 

Baba, alone now, continued shouting. 

Within seconds, they all clambered into His room. Boiling with rage, He charged them with numerous crimes. They could hardly reply. 

Within no time, punishment was allocated, and all these senior workers rolled onto their backs and into the shoulder stand, their legs pointed up in the air. 

Some of them are old gray haired men. 

As soon as they were so positioned, Baba returned to His drink, as if nothing had happened. He spoke mildly with Keshavanandaji, and paid absolutely no attention to the score of workers so oddly assembled before Him. 

The workers smiled at each other, whispered together, and, knowing it would be a long session, secretly leaned their legs against the walls. 


### Tears in our eyes 

Today was the last day of this month's reporting so all the sectorial representatives were holding garlands, hoping to get a chance to place them on Baba. During these last months He had not directly received any garlands, but rather accepted them only through His personal assistant. 

Still, we had hope. 

After He returned from field walk, we quickly lined up at the side door. There are two entrances to the main reporting room: the front door, and the side door which Baba uses as He walks upstairs to His room. 

He would not enter the reporting room at this late time. Since Fareast Asia — Hong Kong Sector — is always the first to be called, I stood at the front of the line. For some minutes He talked to us. Then He turned to go upstairs. We would not be able to put our garlands on 
Him... 

Then abruptly He pivoted, and walked into the reporting room. 
Within a moment He was seated, and I heard Keshavanandaji yell, 
"Hong Kong Sector!" 

The narrow path back around the house to the front was blocked by 26 workers: two Dadas and one Didi from each of the nine sectors. 

I could not push them aside, but neither could I delay when I was being called before Baba. So I jumped. I wonder how I did it, and still people ask me about it, but I jumped over this entire crowd of workers, and in no time ran through the front door and up to Baba. 

Keshavanandaji smiled broadly and tilted his head, also marveling at how I came so fast. 

Without waiting for permission, I placed my garland over Baba's head, and draped it on His neck. His eyes glittered. All my excitement disappeared as I became lost in His affection. 

"Did you enjoy the program, Dharmavedananda?" 

"Too much, Baba." 

"But do you remember our days together in Berlin Sector?" 

His tone made me start crying. "Just like... it was yesterday... Baba." 

He smiled at me, and kept His eyes on me, though He said nothing. 
His eyes also teared. After some time the magic shifted, and He did 
namaskar to me, tears still shining in our eyes. 

From that moment my state of mind was so altered that I cannot 
remember anything else that happened. 

Y ou will see 

Dada Mantreshvarananda told me that on a recent field walk he had 
the following conversation with Baba: 

DADA: Baba, today the materialists have all the power. They have all 
the manpower, all the wealth, all the technological strength. The spiritual-moralists, on the other hand, are but few in number, having no wealth, and almost no machinery. Excuse me for asking, Baba, but in the face of this reality, how can we expect to see the realization of a 
Proutist government within any reasonable period of time? 

BABA (abruptly turning toward Mantreshvaranandaji): There is no one who can stop Prout's progress. It will be established within a very short time. (Pointing His finger at Dada) You will see. 

Improving bodies for improved service 

During reporting of Dadas, in the midst of the review of one worker, 
Baba suddenly interrupted him: 

BABA: There is a dull pain in the lower vertebrae of your spine. Is it 
not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Occasionally it flares into acute pain. Is it not? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: Have you not experienced these symptoms for several years? 
DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA (looking at the General Secretary): GS Da, place your right thumb 
in my palm. (The General Secretary does so, and Baba rubs his thumb 
between His two hands.) What is the feeling in your thumb now? 
GENERAL SECRETARY: It is very hot, Baba. 

BABA: Using that hot thumb, touch the vertebrae in the area of his 
svadhistana chakra (i.e., area of lower back). (Speaking to first Dada:) 

Is that the area of your pain? 

DADA: Yes, Baba. 

BABA: GS, twist and turn your hot thumb ... move slightly higher ... 
yes... now move down the spine ... continue ... yes ... that is enough. 

Now, how do you feel, my boy? 

DADA: I feel full of power. 

BABA: And the pain? 

DADA: It is gone, Baba. 

BABA: It will not return. Now, what plan have you chalked out for 
the use of your improved body? 

DADA: I will do maximum service to the suffering humanity, Baba. 
BABA: Very good. Very good.
