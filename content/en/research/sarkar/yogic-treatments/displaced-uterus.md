## Causes of Displaced Uterus

The uterus lies in a suspended position supported by a few ligaments behind the navel region.

So it is not at all unusual for the uterus to get displaced or to change sides. Since the uterus is situated in between the urinary bladder and the rectum, any displacement of it may hinder defecation or urination. 

The uterus has an elastic quality and can shrink and expand. This is why a positional change of the uterus may cause great disorder in the lower trunk.

**Constipation is the main cause of this disease**. The accumulation of stool swells the colon. This puts pressure on the uterus, causing it to change its position. 

**Excessive sexual activity is the main cause of constipation.**

During menstruation, when the uterus remains full of blood, bending forward to do any heavy chore, or lifting heavy pots from the stove, may also lead to the displacement of the uterus.

Due to excessive sexual intercourse, the nervous system of the lower portion of the body may suffer from all-round debility. 

Consequently, those few ligaments that keep the uterus suspended also become weak, and thereby become a factor in the displacement of the uterus.

Too much use of medicines and injections also weakens the blood and nerve-cells, due to which dislodgement of the uterus may occur. Anaemia and nervous debilities caused in this way are two of the many causes of displacement of the uterus.

Repeated induced child-births, short-cutting the body’s normal child-bearing forces, may also weaken the nerves of the lower body. This enhances the chance of displacement of the uterus.

<!-- Treatment:
Morning – Utkśepa Mudrá, Padahastásana, Shalabhásana, Ud́d́ayana Mudrá, Bandhatraya Yoga Mudrá, and Ámbhasii Mudrá or Ámbhasii Práńáyáma.
Evening – Padahastásana, Pashcimottánásana, Sarváuṋgásana, Matsyamudrá, and Kákacaiṋcu Mudrá.
Taking vyápaka snána is very beneficial with this disease. See restriction on ásanas given under “Treatment”, Section C of this chapter. -->

## Diet

Same as for abnormal menstruation.


## Dos and don’ts

Disease patients should rest as much as possible. Sexual intercourse should be completely stopped if:
- the uterus is totally displaced
- there is acute burning
- the displacement arises from a tumor in the uterus or in the abdomen.

But some women in this situation undergo surgery to remove the uterus or ovaries. This is like trying to cure a headache by cutting off the head.

<!-- Obviously, such surgery cannot bring about a cure.  -->

The loss of these important glands:
- makes a woman sexually neuter
- brings about great changes in body and mind
- makes different mental disorders appear
- often makes the woman go mad. 

So as soon as a woman realizes that she has a displaced uterus, she should be especially careful to avoid constipation and to see that her urination remains normal.
