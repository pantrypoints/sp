## Symptoms of Hemorrhoids (Piles)

“Developed piles” happens when contaminated gas and blood cannot get out of the body. 

This causes pressure on the veins and capillaries around the anus which becomes swollen. 

“External piles” are those outside the anus. "Internal piles" are those inside the anus. 

“Bleeding piles” happen when blood oozes out of the developed piles under pressure of the Apána Váyu (vital energy controlling the lower abdominal organs). 

“Dry piles” are piles which do not bleed but are instead painful, aching, burning or itching.

## Causes of Hemorrhoids (Piles)

Constipation due to a defective liver is the main cause of piles. 

Piles is a disease of the entire system, so there are many other reasons for it. 

The first is lack of physical exercise.

The second is sexual over-indulgence. 

Straining at stool often aggravates the disease.

Remember that without constipation and defective functioning of the liver one can never suffer from piles.

<!-- Treatment:

## Diet for Hemorrhoids (Piles)

If the patient of piles feels hungry early in the morning, he or she may eat some sweet or sour juicy fruit. 

At noon take a lot of leafy vegetables, or soup made from leafy vegetables, along with a small quantity of rice or fresh rut́i (chápáti – flat bread made from whole-wheat flour). 

Arum (Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) Bl.) curd-water, soup, figs, mána kacu, pat́ol, tomato, spinach, green (unripe) pumpkin (Benincasa cerifera Savi), squash (Lagenaria vulgaris Seringe), and núneshák are particularly beneficial. 

The patient should drink a glass of curd-water twice a day.


### Dos and don’ts for Hemorrhoids (Piles)

It is not possible to achieve a permanent cure by removing the developed piles through surgery or through stopping the bleeding by any method, because if the root causes are not eliminated, the disease may attack again at any moment, or the contaminated gas and blood in the body may cause some other disease. 

Therefore, though it may not be improper to employ some temporary expedient to stop severe bleeding at the critical stage, the liver has to be restored in order to obtain a permanent cure. 

If the liver becomes healthy, the piles will disappear without any treatment.

The patient has to be careful to have a sharp appetite at noon. With piles all extra-alkaline food must be carefully avoided. 

It is desirable for the patients to avoid eating plantain spathe, plantain flower, plantain fruit or meoyá fruit.

At the critical stage of the disease fasting is always recommended. During fasting, plenty of water, and, if desired, sweet or sour citrus juices mixed in water may be consumed. Piles patients should not eat hot (i.e. spicy), salty or rough foods.


## Remedies for Hemorrhoids (Piles)

1. After defecation wash the anus with alum-water. 

If one applies slightly-warm neem ghee prepared from tender young neem (margosa, Melia azadirachta indica A. Juss.) leaves on the developed piles, the disease will be cured within a few days.

It is desirable to use this neem ghee at bedtime also.

2. In the early morning take 2 tolas of dugdhakśiirá juice on an empty stomach. This will bring good results.

3. In cases of severe bleeding, drinking 1 tola of kuksiimá, or in its absence durbá juice twice a day will produce good results.

4. A very favourable result can be obtained if 1 tola of husked black sesame seeds mixed with 2 tolas of butter are taken early in the morning.

5. The developed piles will gradually disappear, if, applying a piece of shimula cotton soaked in kuksiimá juice on them like a bandage, they are exposed to the sun every day for a few days.

6. 2 tolas of myrobalan pulverized in cow’s urine, taken regularly along with cane guŕ (raw sugar) over a period of twenty-one days, by licking it, will have a wonderful effect.

7. Slowly sipping old raw sugar of dates, mixed in water, early in the morning, will relieve the severity of piles.

8. Vyápaka shaoca before and after meals is a must for all piles patients.
