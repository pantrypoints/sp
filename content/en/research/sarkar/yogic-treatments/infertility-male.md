## Causes of Impotency and Infertility

In most cases, if not all, impotency is a disease of the intemperate. There are various causes of this disease –

1. Mental impotency

This is when the seminal receptacle is already full, a passionate thought will bring a seminal discharge in no time. 

2. Pitta impotency

This is excessive accumulation of poisonous acid or pitta in the body can also effect a quick seminal discharge. 

Under such a condition the pitta of the male eliminates the possibility of conception by killing female ova.

3. Conflict impotency

If the male and female have a bitter relationship, the resulting mental conflict in the male can bring about a quick emission and destroy chances of conception. 

4. Seminal infertility

This is when the seminal fluid becomes thin and weak due to excessive waste of semen due to:
- the bad habit of masturbation during adolescence or youth
- the lack of restraint in married life

<!-- This is also a kind of sexual debility, and it is called . -->

5. Infertility due to an ascension of shukra

This is when one:
- is engaged in much mental or spiritual effort 
- devotes much time to Dhyána, Dhárańá, and Práńáyáma

This causes his shukra to take too much of an upward course. This causes his testes unable to  produce sufficient spermatozoa.

**In the absence of passionate thoughts, spermatozoa cannot be formed.**

6. Syphilitic impotency or infertility

This is due to chronic venereal diseases such as gonorrhoea or syphilis, sometimes males and females suffer from impotency or infertility.

7. Genital impotency

This is caused by a serious lack of sexual restraint, making the nerves of the pelvis and genitals weak or damaged.

The penis loses its power of erection and becomes very weak.

8. Congenital impotency

This is when there is a congenital weakness of the genital organs, testes, ovaries, etc.

This type of impotency is not curable without surgery or intense meditation.

It is possible to convert a male person into a female or vice versa with the help of surgery or intense meditation.

Females who lack sexual self-restraint may also suffer from infertility (analogous to seminal infertility in the male). 

Such infertile females suffer from severe abdominal pain during intercourse and also from chronic constipation.

Over-indulgence in sexual intercourse may also bring frigidity to women. Such frigid women do not have any particular nervous sensation during sexual intercourse.


## Treatment for Impotency and Infertility
