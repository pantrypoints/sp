## Causes of Rheumatism

The causes of this disease are just like those of acidity. It occurs when the váyu bodily air is disturbed due to excess of poisonous acids in the body.


## Treatment: Same as for acidity

Rheumatism patients should:
- drink a sufficient quantity of water (4-5 seers a day, but not much at a time)
- observe the bathing and sun-bathing procedures. 

First the diseased limb should be exposed several times to the rays of the sun, and finally the entire body. 

The prescribed procedure for sun-bathing should be carefully followed, i.e., exposing the particular limb or the entire body to the sun for 15-20 minutes at a stretch at the time fixed for summer or winter months (see Appendix). 

When the particular limb or the entire body, as the case may be, has become sufficiently warm, the patient should retire to the shade and wipe the area with a wet towel. This can be repeated several times.


## Diet for Rheumatism

Rheumatism is the consequence of the dominance of acid in a person’s system. 

Hence, the more a patient takes alkaline types of food, the better. If 3/4 of the food is alkaline, it will cure rheumatism completely within a very short time.

All kinds of sweet and sour fruits, and roots, are good for a rheumatism patient. 

Fasting with lemon juice and water on Ekádashii, Púrńimá and Amávasyá days must be observed. 

Instead of cooked rice, it is better to take relatively dry food like rut́i at night. 

But it is always better for rheumatism patients to take as little as possible starchy and acidic food such as rice, rut́i, luci, etc., and instead to take fruits, roots, vegetable soups, etc., which are alkaline.


## Dos and don’ts for Rheumatism

Like acidity, special care must be taken to clear the bowels regularly.


## Remedies for Rheumatism

All remedies prescribed for acidity are also applicable in this disease. 

1. When rheumatism first starts expressing itself, a mild purgative will cure it quickly. 10 or 12 tender leaves of sodála fried in ghee; or
2. 10 or 12 tender leaves of bichuti fried in ghee – either of the two eaten with rice, will yield good results in the initial stages of rheumatism.
3. Castor oil with a little salt or
4. Ákanda gum with a little salt, rubbed on the rheumatic limbs, will give good results.
5. Rheumatism can be cured by placing a warm solution of sajne gum mixed with water and a little asafoetida (Ferula foetida Regel) on the affected limb, or
6. Applying garlic, ginger and the root of apámárga, pounded together, to the affected limb.
7. Fry some pork in mustard oil and rub that oil on the limbs. This will ease the pain.
8. Tiger fat rubbed on the limbs will work similarly.
9. Either anantamúla extract with honey or
10. Gulaiṋca extract; duly cooled and taken in 5 tolas’ quantity every morning, will yield good results within a very short time.
11. Boil 2 tolas of triphalá in half a seer of water. When it has boiled down to 1/8 seer and is still warm, add 2 tolas of ginger extract. Drinking this for 3 days will surely cure rheumatic fever as well as to elephantiasis, filaria, or any similar condition.
