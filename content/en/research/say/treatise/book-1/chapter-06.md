Let us take the example of a product of external commerce; such as indigo. 

The science of the geographer, the traveller, the astronomer, brings us acquainted with the spot where it is to
be met with, and the means of crossing the seas to get at it.

The merchant equips his vessels, and sends them in quest of
the commodity; and the mariner and land-carrier perform the
mechanical part of this production 

<!-- and afterwards have accumulated, of procured the requisite
capital, collected artificers and labourers, and assigned to each
his respective occupation. -->

Human industry consists of 3 distinct operations:

1. theory
2. application 
3. execution


But, looking at the substance, indigo, as a mere primary material of a further or secondary product, of blue cloth for instance; we all know that the chemist is first applied to for
information, as to the nature of the substance, the method of
dissolving it, and mordants requisite for fixing the colour;
the means of perfecting the process of dyeing are then col-
lected by the master manufacturer, under whose orders the
labourer executes the manual part of the process.

Finally, the work must have been completed by the manual skill of the workmen employed; some in constructing the
buildings and furnaces, some in keeping up the fire, mixing
up the ingredients, blowing, cutting, rolling out, fitting and
fixing the pane of glass. The utility and beauty of the resulting product, are inconceivable to those who have never be-
held this admirable creation of human industry. 

By means of  industry, the vilest materials have been invested with the highest degree of utility. The very rags and refuse of wearing ap-
parel have been transformed into the white and thin sheets, that convey from one end of the globe to the other, the requi-
sitions of commerce and the particulars of art; that serve as
the depositories of the conceptions of genius, and the vehicles
of human experience from one age to another; to them we
look for the evidence of our properties; to them we entrust
the most noble and amiable sentiments of the heart, and by
them we awaken corresponding feelings in the breasts of our
fellow-creatures. The extraordinary facilities for the commu-
nication of human intelligence which paper affords, entitles
it to be considered as one of the products that have been most
efficacious in ameliorating the condition of mankind. Fortu-
nate, indeed, would it have been, had an engine so powerful
never have been made the vehicle of falsehood, or the instru-
ment of tyranny!

Industry is divisible into theory, application, and execution. 

Nor can it approximate to perfection in any na-
tion, till that nation excel in all three branches. A people, that
is deficient in one or other of them cannot acquire products,
which are and must be the result of all three. And thus we
may learn to appreciate the vast utility of many sciences,
which, at first sight, appear to be the objects of mere curios-
ity and speculation. 67

The negroes of the coast of Africa are possessed of considerable ingenuity, and excel in all athletic exercises and handicraft occupations; but they seem greatly deficient in the two
previous operations of industry. Wherefore, they are under
the necessity of purchasing from Europe the stuffs, arms, and
ornaments, they stand in need of=  Their country yields so few
products, notwithstanding its natural fertility, that the slave
traders are obliged to lay in their stock of provisions beforehand, to feed the slaves during the voyage. 68

In qualities favourable to industry, the moderns have greatly
surpassed the ancients, and the Europeans outstrip all the other
nations of the globe. The meanest inhabitant of an European
town enjoys innumerable comforts unattainable to the sover-
eign of a savage tribe. The single article, glass, that admits
light into his apartment, and, at the same time, excludes the
inclemency of the weather, is the beautiful result of observa-
tion and science, accumulated and perfected during a long
course of ages. To obtain this luxury, it was necessary previ-
ously to know what kind of sand was convertible into a sub-
stance possessing extension, solidity, and transparency; as well
as by the compound of what ingredients, and by what degree
of heat, the substance was obtainable=  to ascertain, besides,
the best form of furnace. The very wood-work, that supports
the roof of a glass-house, requires, in its construction, the
most extensive knowledge of the strength of timber, and the
means of employing it to advantage.

It is worth while to remark, that the knowledge of the man of
science, indispensable as it is to the development of industry,
circulates with ease and rapidity from one nation to all the
rest. 

And men of science have themselves an interest in its
diffusion; for upon that diffusion they rest their hopes of for-
tune, and, what is more prized by them, of reputation too. For
this reason, a nation, in which science is but little cultivated,
may nevertheless carry its industry to a very great length, by
taking advantage of the information derivable from abroad.

But there is no way of dispensing with the other two operations of industry, the art of applying the knowledge of man to the supply of his wants, and the skill of execution. These qualities are of advantage to none but their possessors; so that a country well stocked with intelligent merchants, manufacturers, and agriculturists has more powerful means of attaining
prosperity, than one devoted chiefly to the pursuit of the arts
and sciences. At the period of the revival of literature in Italy,
Bologna was the seat of science; but wealth was centred in
Florence, Genoa, and Venice.

Nor was the mere knowledge of these matters sufficient; for that knowledge might possibly have lain dormant in the
memory of one or two persons, or in the pages of literature. 

It was further requisite, that a manufacturer should have been
found, possessed of the means of reducing the knowledge
into practice; who should have at first made himself master
of all that was known of that particular branch of industry,
In our days, the enormous wealth of Britain is less owing to
her own advances in scientific acquirements, high as she ranks
in that department, than to the wonderful practical skill of her
adventurers al the useful application of knowledge, and the success ensue, the adventurer rewarded by a longer period of exclusive advantage, because his process is less open to observation. In some places, too, the exclusive advantage is protected by patents of invention. 

For all which reasons, the
progress of manufacturing is generally more rapid and more
diversified than that of agricultural industry.
superiority of her workmen in rapid and masterly execution.
The national pride, that the English are often charged with,
does not prevent their accommodating themselves with won-
derful facility to the tastes of their customers and the con-
sumers of their produce. They supply with hats both the north
and the south, because they have learnt to make them light
for the one market, and warm and thick for the other. Whereas
the nation that makes but of one pattern, must be content with
the home market only.

In commercial industry, the risk of experiment would be
greater than in the other two branches, if the costs of the ad-
venture had no auxiliary and concurrent object. But it is usu-
ally in the course of a regular trade, that a merchant hazards
the introduction of a virgin commodity of foreign growth into
an untried market. In this manner it was that the Dutch, about
the middle of the seventeenth century, while prosecuting their
commerce with China, with no very sanguine expectation,
made experiment of a small assortment of dried leaves, from
which the Chinese were in the habit of preparing their favourite
beverage. Thus commenced the tea-trade, which now occa-
sions the annual transport of more than 45 millions of pounds
weight, that are sold in Europe for a sum of more than
80,000,000 of dollars. 70

The English labourer seconds the master manufacturer; he is
commonly patient and laborious, and does not willingly send
out an article from his hands, without giving it the utmost
possible precision and perfection; not that he bestows more
time upon it, but that he gives it more of his care, attention
and diligence, than the workmen of most other nations.
There is no people, however, that need despair of acquiring
the qualities requisite to the perfection of their industry. It is
but 150 years since England herself had made so little
progress, that she purchased nearly all her woollens from Bel-
gium; and it is not more than 80 years since Germany sup-
plied with cotton goods the very nation, that now manufac-
tures them for the whole world. 69

In some cases of very rare occurrence, boldness is nearly cer-
tain of success. When the Europeans had recently discovered
the pas sage round the Cape of Good Hope and the continent
of America, their world was suddenly expanded to the East
and West; and such was the infinity of new objects of desire
in two hemispheres, whereof one was not at all, and the other
but very imperfectly known before, that an adventurer had
only to make the voyage, and was sure of selling his returns
to great advantage.

The cultivator, the manufacturer, the trader,
make it their business to turn to profit the knowledge already
acquired, and apply it to the satisfaction of human wants. I
ought further to add, that they have need of knowledge of
another kind, which can only be gained in the practical pur-
suit of their respective occupations, and may be called their
technical skill. The most scientific naturalist, with all his su-
perior information, would probably succeed much worse than
his tenant, in the attempt to improve his own land. A first-rate
mechanist would most likely spin very indifferently without
having served his apprenticeship, though admirably skilled
in the Construction of the cotton-machinery. In the arts there
is a certain sort of perfection, that results only from repeated
trials, sometimes successful and sometimes the contrary. So
that science alone is not sufficient to ensure the progress,
without the aid of experiment, which is always attended with
more or less of risk, and does not always indemnify the ad-
venturer, whose profit, even when successful, is moderated
by competition; although society at large receives the acces-
sion of a new product, or, what amounts to the same thing, of
an abatement in the price of an old one.

In all but such extraordinary cases it is perhaps prudent to
defray the charges of experiments in industry, not out of the
capital engaged in the regular and approved channels of production, but out of the revenue that individuals have to dispose of at pleasure, without fear of impairing their fortune.
The whims and caprices that divert to an useful end the leisure and revenue which most men devote to mere amusement, or perhaps to something worse, cannot be too highly
encouraged. I can conceive no more noble employment of
wealth and talent. A rich and philanthropic individual may, in
this way, be the means of conferring upon the industrious
classes, and upon the consumers at large, in other words, upon
the mass of mankind, a benefit far beyond the mere value of
what he actually disburses, perhaps beyond the whole amount
of his fortune however princely it may be. Who will attempt
to calculate the value conferred on mankind by the unknown
inventor of the plough?


In agriculture, experiments usually cost the rent of the soil
for a year or more, over and above the labour and the capital
engaged in them.

A government, that knows and practises its duties, and has large resources at its disposal, does not abandon to individuals the whole glory and merit of invention and discovery in In manufacture, experiment is hazarded on safer grounds of calculation, capital engaged for a much shorter period, and if the field of industry. The charges of experiment, when defrayed by the government, are not subtracted from the national capital, but from the national revenue; for taxation never does, or, at least, never ought to touch any thing beyond the
revenue of individuals. 

The portion of them so spent is scarcely felt at all, because the burthen is divined among innumerable
contributors; and, the advantages resulting from success being a common benefit to all, it is by no means inequitable that the sacrifices, by which they are obtained, should fall on the
community at large. one with the other=  for the tools and machines which form a
principal item of capital, are commonly but expedients more
or less ingenious, fol turning natural powers to account. 

The steam engine is but a complicated method of taking advantage of the alternation of the elasticity of water reduced to vapour, and of the weight of the atmosphere. So that, in point
of fact, a steam engine employs more productive agency, than
the agency of the capital embarked in it=  for that machine is
an expedient for forcing into the service of man a variety of
natural agents, whose gratuitous aid may perhaps infinitely
exceed in value the interest of the capital invested in the machine.
