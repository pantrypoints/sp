<!-- All machinery must be regarded, from the simplest to the most complicated instrument, from a common file to the most expensive and complex apparatus.  -->

Tools are but simple machines, and machines but complicated tools. We use these to enlarge our own limited powers. 

They reduce labor needs. 

<!--  of our hands and fingers; and both are, in many respects, mere means of obtaining the co-operation of natural agents. 72 Their obvious effect
is to make less labour requisite for the raising the same quan-
tity of produce, or, what comes exactly to the same thing, to
obtain a larger produce from the same quantity of human
labour. —And this is the grand object and the acne of indus-
try. -->

By the term labour I shall designate that continuous action, exerted to perform any one of the operations of industry, or a part only of one of those operations.

Labour, upon whichever of those operations it be bestowed, is productive, because it concurs in the creation of a product.

Thus the labour of the philosopher, whether experimental or literary, is productive; the labour of the adventurer or master-manufacturer is productive, although he perform no actual manual work; the labour of every operative workman is productive, from the common day-labourer in agriculture, to the pilot that governs the motion of a ship.

Whenever a new machine, or a new and more expeditious process is substituted in the place of human labour previ-
ously in activity, part of the industrious human agents, whose
service is thus ingeniously dispensed with, must needs be
thrown out of employ. Whence many objections have been
raised against the use of machinery, which has been often
obstructed by popular violence, and sometimes by the act of
authority itself.

Labour of an unproductive kind, that is to say, such as does not contribute to the raising of the products of some branch of industry or other, is seldom undertaken voluntarily; for
labour, under the definition above given, implies trouble, and
trouble so bestowed could yield no compensation or result-
ing benefit=  wherefore, it would be mere folly or waste in the
person bestowing it. When trouble is directed to the stripping
another person of the goods in his possession by means of
fraud or violence, what was before mere extravagance and
folly, degenerates to absolute criminality; and there results
no production, but only a forcible transfer of wealth from one
individual to another.

To give any chance of wise conduct in such cases, it is neces-
sary beforehand to acquire a clear notion of the economical
effect resulting from the introduction of machinery.
A new machine supplants a portion of human labour, but does
not diminish the amount of the product; if it did, it would be
absurd to adopt it. When water-carriers are relieved in the
supply of a city by any kind of hydraulic engine, the inhabit-
ants are equally well supplied with water. The revenue of the
district is at least as great, but it takes a different direction.
That of the water-carriers is reduced, while that of the mecha-
nists and capitalists, who furnish the funds, is increased. But,
if the superior abundance of the product and the inferior
charges of its production, lower its exchangeable value, the
revenue of the consumers is benefited; for to them every sav-
ing of expenditure is so much gain.

Man, as we have already seen, obliges natural agents, and
even the products of his own previous industry, to work in
concert with him in the business of production. There will,
therefore, be no, difficulty in comprehending the terms labour
or productive service of nature, and labour or productive ser-
vice of capital.

The labour performed by natural agents, and that executed by pre-existent products, to which we have given the name of
capital, are closely analogous, and are perpetually confounded


sale-price of a product do not fall, the acquisition redounds to the profit of the producer; and that without any loss to the
consumer. If it do fall, the consumer is benefited to the whole
amount of the fall, without any loss to the producer.

This new direction of revenue, however advantageous to the community at large, as we shall presently see, is always at-
tended with some painful circumstances. For the distress of a capitalist, when his funds are unprofitably engaged or in a
state of inactivity, is nothing to that of an industrious population deprived of the means of subsistence.

The multiplication of a product commonly reduces its price, that reduction extends its consumption; and so its production, though become more rapid, nevertheless gives employment to more hands than before. 

It is beyond question, that the manufacture of cot ton now occupies more hands in England, France, and Germany, than it did before the introduction of the machinery that has abridged and perfected this branch of manufacture in so remarkable a degree.

Inasmuch as machinery produces that evil, it is clearly objectionable. But there are circumstances that commonly accom-
pany its introduction, and wonderfully reduce the mischiefs, while at the same time they give full play to the benefits of
the innovation. 
<!-- For, -->




1. New machines are slowly constructed, and still more slowly brought into use; so as to give time for those who are interested, to take their measures, and for the public administration to provide a remedy. 73

Another striking example of a similar effect is presented by
the machine used to multiply with rapidity the copies of a
literary performance, — I mean the printing press.

2. Machines cannot be constructed without considerable
labour, which gives occupation to the hands they throw out
of employ. For instance, the supply of a city with water by
conduits gives increased occupation to carpenters, masons,
smiths, paviours, &c. in the construction of the works, the
laying down the main and branch pipes, &c. &c.

Setting aside all consideration of the prodigious impulse given
by the art of printing to the progress of human knowledge
and civilization, I will speak of it merely as a manufacture,
and in an economical point of view. When printing was first
brought into use, a multitude of copyists were of course im-
mediately deprived of occupation; for it may be fairly reck-
oned, that one journeyman printer does the business of two
hundred copyists. We may, therefore, conclude, that 199 out
of 200 were thrown out of work. What followed? Why, in a
little time, the greater facility of reading printed than written
books, the low price to which books fell, the stimulus this
invention gave to authorship, whether devoted to amusement
or instruction, the combination, in short, of all these causes,
operated so effectually as to set at work, in a very little time,
more journeymen printers than there were formerly copyists.

And if we could now calculate with precision, besides the
number of journeymen printers, the total number of other in-
dustrious people that the press finds occupation for, whether
as type-founders and moulders, paper-makers, carriers, com-
positors, bookbinders, booksellers, and the like, we should
probably find, that the number of persons occupied in the
manufacture of books is now 100 times what it was before
the art of printing was invented.

3. The condition of consumers at large, and consequently,
amongst them, of the class of labourers affected by the inno-
vation, is improved by the reduced value of the product that
class was occupied upon.

Besides it would be vain to attempt to avoid the transient
evil, consequential upon the invention of a new machine, by
prohibiting its employment. If beneficial, it is or will be in-
troduced somewhere or other; its products will be cheaper
than those of labour conducted on the old principle; and sooner
or later that cheapness will run away with the consumption
and demand. Had the cotton spinners on the old principle,
who destroyed the spinning-jennies on their introduction into
Normandy, in 1789, succeeded in their object France must
have abandoned the cotton manufacture; every body would
have bought the foreign article, or used some substitute; and
the spinners of Normandy, who, in the end, most of them,
found employment in the new establishments, would have
been yet worse off for employment.

It may be allowable to add, that viewing human labour and
machinery in the aggregate, in the supposition of the extreme
case, viz., that machinery should be brought to supersede hu-
man labour altogether, yet the numbers of mankind would
not be thinned; for the sum total of products would be the
same, and there would probably be less suffering to the poorer
and labouring classes to be apprehended; for in that case the
momentary fluctuations, that distress the different branches
of industry, would principally affect machinery. which, and
not human labour, would be paralyzed; and machinery cannot die of hunger; it can only cease to yield profit to its employers, who are generally farther removed from want than
mere labourers.


So much for the immediate effect of the introduction of machinery. 

The ultimate effect is wholly in its favour.

If by its means man makes a conquest of nature, and
compels the powers of nature and the properties of natural
agents to work for his use and advantage, the gain is too obvious to need illustration. 

There must always be an increase of product, or a diminution in the cost of production. 

<!-- If the -->


<!-- no otherwise given, than by the spade, the hoe, and other
such simple and tardy expedients, if we were unable to make
available in agricultural production those domestic animals,
that, in the eye of political economy, are but a kind of ma-
chines, it is most likely that the whole mass of human labour,
now applicable to the arts of industry, would be occupied in
raising the bare necessary subsistence of the actual popula-
tion. Thus, the plough has been instrumental in releasing a
number of hands for the prosecution of the arts, even of the
most frivolous kind; and what is of more importance, for the
cultivation of the intellectual faculties. -->

But however great may be the advantages, which the adventurers in industry, and even the operative classes, may ulti-
mately derive from the employment of improved machinery, the great gain accrues to the consumers, which is always the
most important class, because it is the most numerous; because it comprehends every description of producers what-
ever; and because the welfare of this class, wherein all others
are comprised, constitutes the general well-being and prosperity of a nation. 74 I repeat, that it is the consumers who
draw the greatest benefit from machinery; for though the inventor may indeed for some years enjoy the exclusive advan-
tage of his invention, which it is highly just and proper he should, yet there is no instance of a secret remaining long undivulged. Nothing can long escape publicity, least of all what people have a personal interest in discovering, especially if the secret be necessarily confided to the discretion of
a number of persons employed in constructing or in working
the machine. The product is thenceforward cheapened by
competition to the full extent of the saving in the cost of production; and thenceforward begins the full advantage to the consumer.

The grinding of corn is probably not more profitable to the miller now than formerly; but it costs infinitely
less to the consumer.

The ancients were unacquainted with water or wind-mills. In their time, the wheat their bread was made of, was pounded
by the labour of the hand=  so that perhaps no less than twenty
individuals were occupied in pounding as much wheat as one
mill can grind.

A single miller, or two at the most, is
enough to feed and superintend a mill. By the aid, then, of
this ingenious piece of mechanism, two persons are as productive as twenty were in the days of Cesar. Wherefore, in
every one of our mills, we make the wind, or a current of
water, do the work of eighteen persons; which eighteen extra
persons are just as well provided with subsistence; for the
mill has in no respect diminished the general produce of the
community=  and whose exertions may be directed to the creation of new products, to be given by them in exchange for the produce of the mill; thereby augmenting the general wealth of the community. 76

Nor is cheapness the sole benefit that the consumer reaps
from the introduction of more expeditious processes: he generally gains in addition the greater perfection of the product.

Painters could undoubtedly execute with the brush or pencil
the designs that ornament our printed calicoes and furniture
papers, but the copperplates and rollers employed for that
purpose give a regularity of pattern, ana uniformity of colour,
which the most skilful artist could never equal.
