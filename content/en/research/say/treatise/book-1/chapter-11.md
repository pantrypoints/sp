Chapter 10 showed how productive capital, though kept, during the progress of production, in a continual state of employment, and subject to perpetual change and wear, is yet ultimately reproduced in full value, when the business of production is at an end. 

Since, then, wealth con

But let us trace the disposal of this surplus of 1000 dollars to
every imaginable destination. Suppose, for instance, that in-

resown or planted, without having undergone any transmutation; perhaps the wood, that might have been used as firing to
warm superfluous apartments, may have been converted into palings or other carpenter’s work; and what was cut down in
the first instance as an item of revenue, be so employed, as to
become an item of capital.

stead of being buried, they have been spent by the cultivator
upon an elegant entertainment. In this case, this whole value
has been destroyed in an afternoon; a sumptuous feast, a ball,
and fireworks, will have swallowed up the whole. 

The value thus destroyed exists no longer in the community= it no longerforms an item in the aggregate of wealth; for those persons,
into whose hands the identical pieces of silver have come,
have given an equivalent in wines, refreshments, eatables,
gunpowder, &c., all which values are reduced to nothing; the
gross national capital, however, is no more diminished in this
case than in the former. 

A surplus value had been produced;
and this surplus is all that has been destroyed, so that things
remain just as they were.

Now, the only way of augmenting the productive capital of
individuals, as well as the aggregate productive capital of the
community, is by this process of saving; in other words, of
re-employing in production more products created than have
been consumed n their creation. 

Productive capital cannot be accumulated by the mere scraping together of values without
consuming them; nor any otherwise, than by withdrawing them
from unproductive, and devoting them to reproductive con-
sumption. There is nothing odious in the real picture of the
accumulation of capital; we shall presently see its happy con-
sequences.

Again, suppose these 1000 dollars to have been spent in the
purchase of furniture, plate, or linen. Still there is no reduc-
tion of national productive capital; although it must be al-
lowed there is no accession; for in this case, nothing more is
gained than the additional comforts the cultivator and his family derive from the newly purchased moveables.

The form under which national capital is accumulated, is commonly determined by the respective geographical position,
the moral character, and the peculiar wants of each nation.

The accumulations of a society in its early stages consist, for the most part, of buildings, implements of husbandry, live
stock, improvements of land; those of a manufacturing people chiefly of raw materials, or such as are still in the hands of its
workmen, in a more or less finished state; and in some part, of the necessary manufacturing tools and machinery. In a na-
tion devoted to commerce, capital is mostly accumulated in
the form of wrought or unwrought goods, that have been bought by the merchant for the purpose of re-sale.

Fourthly and lastly, suppose the cultivator to add this excess of 1000 dollars to his productive capital, that is to say, to re-
employ it in increasing the productive powers of his farm as circumstances may require, in the purchase of more beasts of
husbandry, or the hire and support of more labourers; 

In consequence, at the end of the year, to gather produce enough to replace the full value of the 1000 dollars, with a profit, in
such manner, as to make them capable of yielding a fresh product the year after, and so on every year to eternity. It is
then, and then only, that the productive capital of the commu-
nity is really augmented to that extent.

A nation that at the same time directs its energies to all three
branches of industry, namely, agriculture, manufactures, and
commerce, has a capital compounded of all three different
forms of production; of that amazing quantity of stores of
every kind, that we find civilized society actually possessed
of; and which, by the intelligent use that is made of them, are
constantly renovated, or even increased, in spite of their enor-
mous consumption, provided that the industry of the commu-
nity produces more than is destroyed by its consumption.
It must on no account be overlooked, that, in one way or other,
a saving such as that we have been speaking of, whether
expendec productively or unproductively, still is in all cases
expended ano consumed; and this is a truth, that must re-
move a notion extremely false, though very much in vogue-
namely, that saving limits and injures consumption. No act of
saving subtracts in the least from consumpclon, provided the
thing saved be re-invested or restored to productive employ-
ment. On the contrary, it gives rise to a consumption perpetu-
ally renovated and recurring; whereas there is no repetition
of an unproductive consumption. 98
I do not mean to say, that each nation has produced and laid
by the identical article that composes its actual capital. Val-
ues, in some shape or other, have been produced and laid by;
and these, through various transmutations, have assumed the
form most convenient foi the time being. A bushel of wheat
saved will feed a mason as well as a worker in embroidery. In
the one case, the bushel of wheat will be reproduced in the
shape of the masonry of a house; in the other, under that of a
laced suit.

The form in which the value saved is so saved and re-employed productively, makes no essential difference. 

The saving is made with more or less advantage, according to the circumstances and intelligence
of the person making it. Nor is there any reason why this
portion of capital should not have been accumulated, without
ever having for a moment assumed the form of specie. It may
be that an actual product of the farm has been saved and

prodigal to be a public pest, and every careful and frugal per-
son to be a benefactor of society. 100
Every adventurer in industry, that has a capital of his own
embarked in it, has ready means of employing his saving pro-
ductively; if engaged in husbandry, he buys fresh parcels of
land; or, by judicious outlays and improvements, augments
the productive powers of what already belongs to him; if in
trade, he buys and sells a greater quantity of merchandise.
Capitalists have nearly the same advantage= they invest their
whole savings in the same manner as their former capital is
invested, and increase it pro tanto, or look out for new ways
of investment, which they are at no loss to discover; for the
moment they are known to be possessed of loose funds, they
seldom have to wait for propositions for the employment of
them; whereas the proprietors of lands let out to farm, and
individuals that live upon fixed income, or the wages of their
personal labour, have not equal facility in the advantageous
disposal of their savings, and can seldom invest them till they
amount to a good round sum. Many savings are therefore
consumed, that might otherwise have swelled the capitals of
individuals, and consequently of the nation at large. Banks
and associations, whose object is to receive, collect, and turn
to profit the small savings of individuals, are consequently
very favourable to the multiplication of capital, whenever they
are perfectly secure.

It is fortunate, that self-interest is always on the watch to pre-
serve the capital of individuals; and that capital can at no
time be withdrawn from productive employment, without a
proportionate loss of revenue.

Adam Smith thinks that, in every country, the profusion and ignorance of individuals and of the government is more than compensated by the prevalent frugality of the people at large. By their careful attention to their own interests. 101

At least it seems undeniable, that almost all the nations of Europe are at this moment advancing in opulence; which could
not be the case, unless each of them, taken in the aggregate, produced more than it consumed unproductively. 102 Even the
revolutions of modern times appear to have been rather favourable than otherwise to the progress of opulence; for
they are no longer, as in ancient days, followed by continued
hostile invasion, or universal and protracted pillage; whereas,
on the other hand, they have commonly overthrown the bar-
riers of prejudice, and opened a wider field for talent and
enterprise. 

But it is still a question, whether this frugality, which Smith gives individuals credit for, be not, in the most
numerous classes of society, a forced consequence of a vi-
cious political organization. Is it true, that those classes re-
ceive their fair proportion of the gross produce, in return for
their productive exertions? How many individuals live in
constant penury, in the countries considered as the most
wealthy! 

How many families are there, both in town and country, whose whole existence is a succession of privations; who,
with every thing around them to awaken their desires, are
reduced to the satisfaction of the very lowest wants, as if they
lived in an age of the grossest barbarism and national poverty!

The increase of capital is naturally slow of progress= for it
can never take place without actual production of value, and
the creation of value is the work of time and labour, besides
other ingredients. 99 

Since the producers are compelled to consume values all the while they are engaged in the creation of
fresh ones, the utmost they can accumulate, that is to say, add
to reproductive capital, is the value they produce beyond what
they consume; and the sum of this surplus is all the additional
wealth that the public or individuals can acquire. 

The more values are saved and reproductively employed in the year,
the more rapid is the national progress towards prosperity. Its
capital is swelled, a larger quantity of industry is set in motion, and saving becomes more and more practicable, because
the additional capital and industry are additional means of production.

Thus I am forced to infer, that, though unquestionably there is an annual saving of produce in almost all the nations of
Europe, this saving is extorted much more commonly from urgent and natural wants, than from the consumption of superfluities, to which policy and humanity would hope to trace it. 

Whence arises a strong suspicion of some radical defect in the policy and internal economical systems of most of their
governments.

Every saving or increase of capital lays the groundwork of a
perpetual annual profit, not only to the saver himself, but like-
wise to all those whose industry is set in motion by this item
of new capital. It is for this reason that the celebrated Adam
Smith likens the frugal man, who enlarges his productive capi-
tal but in a solitary instance, to the founder of an almshouse
for the perpetual support of a body of labouring persons upon
the fruits of their own labour; and on the other hand, compares the prodigal that encroaches upon his capital, to the
roguish steward that should squander the funds of a charitable institution, and leave destitute, not merely those that
derived present subsistence from it, but likewise all who might
derive it hereafter. 

He pronounces, without reserve, every

Again, Smith thinks that the moderns are indebted for their
comparative opulence, rather to the prevalence of individual
frugality, than to the enlargement of productive power. I ad-
mit, that some absurd kinds of profusion are more rare now-
a-days than formerly; 103 but it should be recollected, that such
profusion can never be practised, except by a very small num-
ber of persons; and if we take the pains to consider how widely
the enjoyment of a more abundant and varied consumption is

diffused, particularly among the middle classes of society, I
think it will be found, that consumption and frugality have
increased both together; for they are by no means incompat-
ible. How many concerns are there in every branch of indus-
try, that, in times of prosperity, yield enough produce to the
adventurers to enable them to enlarge both their expenses
and their savings? What is true of one particular concern,
may possibly be true of the national production in the aggre-
gate. The wealth of France was progressively increasing dur-
ing the first forty years of the reign of Louis XIV, in spite of
the profusion, public and private, that the splendour of the
court occasioned. The stimulus given to production by
Colbert, multiplied her resources faster than the court squan-
dered them. Some people supposed, that this very prodigal-
ity was the cause of their multiplication; the gross fallacy of
which notion is demonstrated by the circumstance, that after
the death of that minister, the extravagancies of the court con-
tinuing at the same rate, and the progress of production being
unable to keep pace with them, the kingdom was reduced to
an alarming state of exhaustion. The close of that reign was
the most gloomy that can be imagined.

For this improvement in frugality, we are indebted to the ad-
vances of industry, which has, on the one hand discovered a
greater number of economical processes; and, on the other,
everywhere solicited the loan of capital, and tempted the hold-
ers of it, great or small, by better terms and greater security.
In times when little industry existed, capital, being unprofit-
able, was seldom in any other shape than that of a hoard of
specie locked up in a strong box, or buried in the earth as a
reserve against emergency= however considerable in amount,
it yielded no sort of benefit whatever, being in fact little else
than a mere precautionary deposit, great or small. But the
moment that this hoard was found capable of yielding a profit
proportionate to its magnitude, its possessor had a double
motive for increasing it, and that not of remote or precaution-
ary, but of actual, immediate benefit; since the profit yielded
by the capital might, without the least diminution of it, be
consumed and procure additional gratifications. Thencefor-
ward it became an object of greater and more general solici-
tude than before, in those that had none to create, and in those
that had one to augment, productive capital; and a capital
bearing interest began to be regarded as a property equally
lucrative, and sometimes equally substantial with land yield-
ing rent. To such as regard the accumulation of capital as an
evil, insomuch as it tends to aggravate the inequality of hu-
man fortune, I would suggest, that, if accumulation has a con-
stant tendency to the multiplying of large fortunes, the course
of nature has an equal tendency to divide them again. A man,
whose life has been spent in augmenting his own capital and
that of his country, must die at last, and the succession rarely
devolves upon a sole heir or legatee, except where the na-
tional laws sanction entails and the right of primogeniture. In
countries exempt from the baneful influence of such institu-
tions, where nature is left to its own free and beneficent ac-
tion, wealth is naturally diffused by subdivision through all
the ramifications of the social tree, carrying health and life to
the furthest extremities. 107 The total capital of the nation is
enlarged at the same time that the capital of individuals is
subdivided.

After the death of Louis XIV, the public and private expendi-
ture of France have been still further increasing; 104 and to me
it appears indisputable, that her national wealth has advanced
likewise= Smith himself admits that it did; and what is true of
France is so of most of the other states of Europe in some
degree or other.

Turgot 105 falls in with Smith’s opinion. He expresses his be-
lief, that frugality is more generally prevalent now than in
former times, and gives the following reasons= that, in most
European countries, the interest of money was, on the aver-
age, lower than it had ever before been, a clear proof of the
greater abundance of capital; therefore, that greater frugality
must have been exerted in the accumulation of that capital
than at any former period; and, certainly, the low rate of in-
terest proves the existence of more abundant capital= but it
proves nothing with regard to the manner of its acquirement
in fact, it may have been acquired just as well by enlarged
production as by greater frugality, as I have just been demon-
strating.
However, I am far from denying, that in many particulars, the
moderns have improved the art of saving as well as that of
producing. A man is not easily satisfied with less gratifica-
tions than he has been accustomed to= but there are many
which he has learnt to procure at a cheaper rate. For instance,
what can be more beautiful than the coloured furniture pa-
pers that adorn the walls of our apartments, combining the
grace of design with the freshness of colouring? Formerly,
many of those classes of society that now make use of paper
hangings, were content with whitewashed walls, or a coarse
Thus, the growing wealth of an individual, when honestly
acquired and reproductively employed, far from being viewed
with jealous eyes, ought to be hailed as a source of general
prosperity. I say honestly acquired, because a fortune amassed
by rapine or extortion is no addition to the national stock; it is

litical convulsions, there is always a sensible contraction of
capital, a stagnation of industry, a disappearance of profit,
and a general depression while the alarm continues= and, on
the contrary, an instantaneous energy and activity highly
favourable to public prosperity, upon the re-establishment of
confidence. The saints and madonnas of superstitious nations,
the splendid pageantry and richly decorated iools of Asiatic
worship, gave life to no agricultural or manufacturing enter-
prise. The riches of the fane and the time lost in adoration
would really purchase the blessings that barren prayers can
never extort from the object of idolatry. There is a great deal
of inert capital in countries, where the national habits lead to
the extended use of the precious metals in furniture, clothes,
and decorations. The silly admiration bestowed by the lower
orders on the display of such idle and unproductive finery, is
hostile to their own interests. For the opulent individual, who
vests 20,000 dollars, in gilding, plate, and the splendour of
his establishment, has it not to lay out at interest, and with-
draws it from the support of industry of any kind. The nation
loses the annual revenue of so much capital, and the annual
profit of the industry it might have kept in activity.
rather a portion of capital transferred from the hands of one
man, where it already existed, to those of another, who has
exerted no productive industry. On the contrary, it is but too
common, that wealth ill-gotten is ill-spent also. The faculty
of amassing capital, or, in other words, value, I apprehend to
be one cause of the vast superiority of man over the brute
creation. Capital, taken in the aggregate, is a powerful engine
consigned to the use of man alone. He can direct towards any
one channel of employment the successive accumulations of
many generations. Other animals can command, at most, no
more than their respective individual accumulations, scraped
together in the course of a few days, or a season at the ut-
most, which can never amount to any thing considerable= so
that, granting them a degree of intelligence they do not seem
possessed of, that intelligence would yet remain ineffectual,
for want of the materials to set it in motion.

Moreover, it may be remarked, that the powers of man, re-
sulting from the faculty of amassing capital, are absolutely
indefinable; because there is no assignable limit to the capi-
tal he may accumulate. with the aid of time, industry, and
frugality.

Hitherto we have been considering that kind of value only,
which is capable, after its creation, of being, as it were, incor-
porated with matter, and preserved for a longer or shorter
period. But all the values producible by human industry, have
not this quality. Some there are, which must have reality, be-
cause they are in high estimation, and purchased by the ex-
change of costly and durable products, which nevertheless
have themselves no durability, but perish the moment of their
production. This class of values I shall define in the ensuing
chapter, and denominate immaterial products. 108
