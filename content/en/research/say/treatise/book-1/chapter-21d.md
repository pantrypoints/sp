No mention has hitherto been made of the value that money derives from the impression and coinage. I have merely
pointed out the various utility of gold and silver as articles of
commerce, wherein originates their value; and considered their
fitness to act as money, as part of that utility.

Wherever gold and silver act as money, they must of course be constantly passing from hand to hand. 

Most people buy or sell several times a day; judge, then, what inconvenience must
ensue, were it necessary to be always provided with scales to
weigh the money paid or received; and what infinite blunders
and disputes must arise from awkwardness or defective implements. Nor is this all; gold and silver can be compounded
with other metals without any visible alteration. 

The degree of purity can not be exactly ascertained, without a delicate
and complex chemical process. The transactions of exchange
are wonderfully facilitated, when the weight and standard of
each piece of money are denoted by an impression, that nobody can mistake.

Metals are reduced to an established standard, and divided into pieces of an established weight, by the art of coining.

The government of each state usually reserves to itself the exclusive exercise of this branch of manufacture; whether with
a view of gaining somewhat more by the monopoly, than it could, if every body were at liberty to practise it, or to hold
out to the subjects a more solid security, than any private manufacturer could offer, which is more frequently the motive. 

In fact, though governments have too often broken faith in this particular, their guarantee is still preferred by the people
to that of individuals, both for the sake of uniformity in the
coin, and because there would probably be more difficulty in
detecting the frauds of private issuers.

The coinage unquestionably adds a value to the metal coined; that is to say, a lump of silver, wrought into a dollar, is better than an equal weight of bullion of like standard; and for a very simple reason. 

The fashion given to the metal saves the person, that takes it in course of exchange, all the charges of
weighing and assaying, among which the loss of time and
labour must be reckoned; just in the same manner as a coat
ready made is worth more than the materials it is to be made
of. Even if the business of coining were open to all the world, and government confined itself to fixing the standard, the weight, and the impression, that each piece should possess, still the holders of bullion would find it answer to pay a premium to the coiner, for coining their bullion into money; otherwise, they would have some difficulty in effecting an exchange, and would, perhaps, lose more on the exchange, than it would cost to have the bullion converted into coin.

But the additional value, thus communicated to the precious
metals by the coinage, must not be confounded with that,
which bullion, as an article of trade, receives from the cir-
cumstance of its employment as money. The latter value at-
taches to the whole stock of gold and silver in existence; a
silver tankard is of greater value, because that metal is em-
ployed as money, whereas, the additional value accruing from
the coinage is peculiar to the specific portion coined, exactly
as its fashion is peculiar to the goblet; and is wholly indepen-
dent of the value, that the commodity, silver, derives from its
various utility.



In England, the whole. expense of coinage is defrayed by the government; the same weight of guineas’s delivered at the mint in return for a like weight of bullion of the legal standard. The nation, in quality of consumer of money, is gratuitously presented with the charges of coining, which are levied by taxation upon them in their other character of payers
of taxes. Yet gold, in the shape of guineas, has an evident
advantage over bullion; not that of being ready weighed, for
people are often at the pains of re-weighing, but that of being
ready assayed. Consequently, it has happened sometimes, that
bullion has been carried to the mint, not to be converted into
coin, but merely to have the standard ascertained, and certi-
fied to the foreign or domestic purchaser. 249 For guineas are a
better article of export than bullion, inasmuch as bullion, bear-
ing the certificate of assay, is preferable to bullion without
any such certificate. On the contrary, for the purposes of im-
portation into England, gold bullion answers every purpose
of guineas ready coined, and is of just the same value, weight
and standard being alike; for the mint makes no charge for
converting the bullion into coin. Foreigners have, in fact, an
object in keeping back the guineas, which have already received the certificate of assay, and remitting bullion to England to obtain a like gratuitous certificate. This system, therefore, makes it an object to export the coined metal, but holds out no encouragement to its reimportation. 


The mischief is somewhat palliated by an accidental circumstance, which never entered into the calculation of the legislature. There is no other mint in England, but that of the metropolis, which is so completely overloaded with business, that it can not re-deliver the metal coined till many weeks, and often months, after it is brought for coinage. 251 The consequence is, that the owner, who leaves his bullion to be
coined, loses the interest of its value during the whole time it remains in the mint. This operates as a small tax on coinage, and raises the value of the coin somewhat above that of bullion. 

The value would be exactly the same, if bullion and guineas were taken without distinction, weight for weight.


All the other governments of Europe derive from the coinage a revenue more than equal to the charges of the process. 252 

The exclusive privilege of issuing money which they have most properly engrossed, together with the severe
penalties denounced against private coiners, would enable
them to raise the profit of the business very high by the limi-
tation of their issues; for the value of money, like that of ev-
ery thing else, is always in the direct ratio to the demand, and
in the inverse ratio to the supply. In fact when silver in the
shape of coin is so rare and dear, that 18 dollars in coin will
purchase the weight of 20 dollars of equal fineness in the
shape of bullion, it is an indication that the public attaches
the same value to 15 oz. 12 dwt. of coined, as to 17 oz. 6 dwt.
16 grs. of uncoined metal. Wherefore, the government can,
by its coinage, in such case, give to 9 dollars, the value of 10
dollars, and make a profit of 10 per cent. But, if the coin
become more abundant, and more of it be necessary in ex-
change for bullion, it may perhaps be necessary to give 95
dollars in coin for the weight of 100 dollars in bullion= in
which latter case, the government can make a profit of no
more than 5 per cent upon the purchase and conversion of
bullion into coin.





When the coinage of money is not executed gratuitously, and
especially when it is paid for at a monopoly-price, it is a mat-
ter of perfect indifference to the state, whether or not its coin
be melted down or exported, for it can neither be melted down
or exported, without having first paid the coinage in full, which
is all that is lost by melting or exportation. 253 On the contrary,
the export of such coin is quite as advantageous as that of any
other manufactured commodity whatever. It is a branch of
the bullion trade; and unquestionably, a coin, so well executed
as to be difficult to counterfeit, accurate in the weight and
assay, and charged with a moderate duty on the coinage, may
acquire a currency in different parts of the world, and yield
the government, that issues it, a profit of no contemptible
amount.


Witness the gold ducats of Holland, which are in request
throughout all the north of Europe, at a higher rate than their
intrinsic value as bullion; and the dollars of Spain, which are
all coined at Lima and Mexico, and have been executed with
so much regularity and integrity, as to pass current as money
not only all over Spanish America, but likewise in the United
States and in several parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. 254
The Spanish dollar is a remarkable instance of the value at-
tached to the metal by the process of coinage. When the
Americans of the Union determined on a national coinage of
dollars, they contented themselves with simply re-stamping
those of the Spanish mint, without varying their weight or
standard. But the piece thus restamped would not pass cur-
rent with the Chinese, and other Asiatics, at the same, rate;
100 dollars of the United States would not purchase so much
of other commodities as 100 dollars of Spain. The American
Executive, nevertheless, continued to deteriorate the coin by
giving it a handsome impression, apparently wishing to avail
itself of this method of checking the export of specie to Asia.
For this purpose it was directed, that all exports of specie
should be made in dollars of its own coinage, hoping in this
way to make the exporters give a preference to the domestic
products of its own territory. Thus, after wantonly depreciat-
ing the Spanish dollar, without prejudice, it is true, to the
specie remaining current within the territory of the Union, it
went on further to enjoin its use in the least profitable way,
viz., in the commercial intercourse with those nations that set
the least value on it. The natural course would have been, to
suffer the value exported to go out of the country in the form
that might offer the prospect of the largest returns. Self-inter-
est might have been safely relied on in this particular. 255
If, in the latter case, the government, with a view to increase
the ratio of its profit, instead of purchasing bullion itself, were
simply to charge a seignorage, say of 10 per cent upon the
bullion brought to the mint for coinage, none at all would be
brought for that purpose by individuals, who would have to
pay 10 per cent for an operation, which added 5 per cent only
to the value of the metal. Thus the mint would have nothing
to coin either on public or private account; and the govern-
ment would find a high ratio of profit incompatible with an
extended amount of coinage.

Whence it may be concluded, that the duty or seignorage upon
coinage, which has been so frequently discussed, is an abso-
lute nullity; for that governments can not fix their own ratio
of profit upon the execution of the coinage, but that it must
depend upon the state of the bullion market, which again is
regulated by the relative supplies of coined and uncoined
metal, and the demand for them at the time being.
It is to be observed, that, to the public at large, in its capacity
of consumer of coined bullion, it is a matter of perfect indif-
ference, whether the coin be dear or cheap; for, so long as its
value is not subject to sudden fluctuations, it will pass cur-
rent for as much as it has been taken for.

But what are we to think of the wisdom of the Spanish gov-
ernment, which was enabled by the confidence in its good
faith in the execution of its coinage, to export dollars with a
profit, and sell them abroad at an advance upon their intrinsic
value; and yet thought fit to prohibit so advantageous a traffic, which would have furnished a vent to a product of the
national soil, worked up by domestic industry for an ample
recompense?

Though a government be the exclusive coiner of money, and is by no means bound to coin gratuitously, it can not with justice deduct the expense of coinage from its payments, in discharge of its own contracts. If it has engaged to pay a million, say for
supplies advanced, it can not honestly say to the contractor:
“We bargained to pay a million, but, we pay you in specie just
coined; and therefore shall deduct 20,000 dollars, more or less,
for the charges of coinage.” In fact, all pecuniary engagements,
contracted by government or individuals, virtually imply a prom-
ise to pay a given sum, not in bullion but in coin. 

The act of exchange, wherein the bargain originated, is effected with the
implied condition, on behalf of one of the contracting parties,
to give a commodity somewhat more valuable than silver bul-
lion; namely, silver in crown pieces, or coin of some denomina-
tion or other.

The virtual contract of a government is to pay in coined money; and, in consequence of that implied condition, it
obtains a greater quantity of goods, than it will, if the bargain be
to pay in bullion. In this instance, it offers the charge of coinage
into the bargain at the time of concluding the contract, and
thereby obtains better terms, than if it is in the habit of paying in
bullion.

The charges of coinage should be deducted from the metal
brought to the mint to be coined, at the time of its re-delivery in
a coined state.

These considerations lead us to the necessary conclusions, — that the manufacture of bullion into coin increases the value of
the metal, in the ratio of the additional convenience resulting to
the community, from the circumstance of coinage, and not an item further, whatever charges or duties the state may attempt
to saddle it with; 256 that a government, by monopolising the
business of coining, may make a profit to the whole extent of
this accession of value; that it can not possibly advance this
profit any further, in its discharge of engagements, fairly and
freely entered into; and that it can not do so with regard to prior
engagements, without committing an act of partial bankruptcy.

Moreover, it is evident that, in all dealings between individuals,
the public authority has still less power, by means of the im-
pression of its die, to make the commodity, acting as money,
pass for more than its intrinsic value, plus the value added by
the fashion it receives. Vain will be any enactment, that the stamp
impressed shall give to an ounce of silver a specific or determi-
nate value; it will never buy more goods than an ounce of silver,
bearing that impression, is worth at the time being.
