The same error, which led public functionaries to believe,
that they could fix the relative value of any metal to com-
modities, has also induced them to determine by act of law
the relative value of the metals employed as money, one to
the other. Thus, it has been arbitrarily enacted, that a given
quantity of silver shall be worth 24 liv., and that a given quan-
tity of gold shall likewise be worth 24 liv. In this manner, the
ratio of the nominal value of gold to that of silver came to be
legally established.

Since 1797, all payments have been made in paper. But, if
England shall return to a metallic currency, framed upon the
former monetary principles and regulations, it is probable that
payments will be made in silver instead of gold, as before the
suspension; for gold has risen in relative price to silver in the
English market, probably in consequence of the large export
of specie for commercial purposes, and greater difficulty of
prevention in gold than in silver. Gold bullion in the English
market is now to silver bullion in the ratio of about 1 to 15½,
although the mint ratio is still 1 to 15 1/14. A payment in gold
The pretension of authority was in both cases equally vain
and impotent; and what has been the consequence? The rela-
107Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
The value of a piece of silver is arbitrary, and is established
by a kind of mutual accord on every act of dealing between
one individual and another, or between the government and
an individual Why, therefore, attempt to fix its value before-
hand? since, after all, the fixation must be imaginary, and can
never answer any practical purpose, in the money transac-
tions of mankind. Why give a denomination to this fixed,
imaginary value, which money can never possess? For what
is a dollar, a ducat, a florin, a pound sterling, or a franc; what,
but a certain weight of gold or silver of a certain established
standard of quality? And, if this be all, why give these re-
spective portions of bullion any other name, than the natural
one of their weight and quality?

instead of silver would therefore be a gratuitous sacrifice of
the difference between 15 1/14 and 15½..
Hence may be drawn this conclusion; that it is impossible in
practice to assign any fixed ratio of exchangeable value to
commodities whose ratio is for ever fluctuating, and, there-
fore, that gold and silver must be left to find their own mutual
level, in the transactions in which mankind may think proper
to employ them. 285

The above remarks upon the relative value of gold and silver
are equally applicable to silver and copper, as well as to all
other metals whatever. There is no more propriety in declar-
ing, that the copper contained in twenty sous shall be worth
the silver contained in a livre tournois, than in enacting, that
the silver contained in 24 liv. tournois shall be worth the gold
in a louis d’or. 

However, little mischief has been occasioned
by fixing the ratio of copper to the precious metals, because
the law does not authorize the payment of sums stipulated in
livres tournois and francs in either copper or the precious
metals indifferently; so that, in reality, the only metal money
recognised by law as legal tender, for sums above the value
of the lowest denomination of silver coin, is silver or gold.
Five grammes of silver, says the law, shall be equivalent to a
franc= which is just as much as to say, 5 grammes of silver is
equivalent to 5 grammes of silver. For the only idea presented
to the mind by the word franc, is that of the 5 grammes of
silver it contains. Do wheat, chocolate or wax, change their
name by the mere act of apportioning their weight? 

A pound weight of bread, chocolate, or of wax candles, is still called a
pound weight of bread, chocolate, or wax candles. Why, then, 
should not a piece of silver, weighing 5 grammes, go by its natural appellation? Why not call it simply 5 grammes of silver?

This slight alteration, verbal, critical, and nugatory as it may
seem, is of immense practical consequence. Were it once ad-
mitted, it would be no longer possible to stipulate in nominal
value; every bargain would be a barter of one substantial com-
modity for another of a given quantity of silver for a given
quantity of grain, or butcher’s meat, of cloth, &c. &c. When-
ever a contract for a long prospective period was entered into,
its violation could not escape detection= a person taking an
obligation to pay a given quantity of fine silver, it a day certain, would know precisely how much silver he would have
to receive at the period assigned, provided his debtor continued solvent.
