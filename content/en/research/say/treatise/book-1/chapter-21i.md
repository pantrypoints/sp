The precious metals are so well adapted for the purposes of money, as to have gained a preference almost universal.

as no other material has so many recommendations, no change
in this particular is desirable.

So also of their division into equal and portable particles.
They may very properly be coined into pieces of equal weight
and quality as has heretofore been the practice among most
civilized nations.

The whole monetary system would thenceforth fall to the
ground; a system replete with fraud, injustice, and robbery,
and moreover so complicated, as rarely to be thoroughly un-
derstood, even by those who make it their profession. It would
ever after be impossible to effect an adulteration of the coin,
except by issuing counterfeit money; or to compound with
creditors, without an open, avowed bankruptcy. The coinage
of money would become a matter of perfect simplicity, a mere
branch of metallurgy.

Nor can there be any better contrivance, than the giving them
such an impression, as shall certify the weight and quality; or
than the exclusive reservation to government of the right of
impressing such certificate, and, consequently, of coining
money; for the certificate of a number of coiners, all working
together and in competition one with the other, could never
give an equal security.

The denominations of weight, in common use before the in-
troduction into France of the metrical system, that is to say,
the once, gros, grain, had the advantage of conveying the
notion of portions of weight, that had remained stationary for
Thus far, then, and no further, should the public authority
intermeddle with the business of money.

many ages, and were applicable to all commodities whatever,
without distinction= so that the once could not be altered for
the precious metals, without altering it at the same time for
sugar, honey, and all commodities sold by the weight= but, in
this particular, the new metrical system is infinitely prefer-
able. It is founded upon a basis provided by nature, which
must remain invariable as long as our world shall last. The
gramme is the weight of a cubic centimetre of water= the
centimetre is the hundredth part of a metre, and the metre is
1/10,000,000 part of the arc formed by the circumference of
the earth, from the pole to the equator. The term gramme may
be changed, but no human power can change that portion of
weight actually designated by the term gramme; and who-
ever shall contract to pay at a future date a quantity of silver,
equal to 100 grammes weight, can never pay a less quantity
of silver, without a manifest breach of faith, whatever arbi-
trary measures of power may intervene.

less value than coin. This is obviously matter of practical ar-
rangement; the principle requiring nothing, but that the obli-
gation, after mentioning the metal and standard, should specify
on the face of it, whether payable in national coin or bullion.
The only object of such a law would be, to save the continual
necessity of enumerating many particulars that would thence-
forward be implied.

A government should never coin the bullion of private per-
sons, without charging the profit, as well as the cost, of the
operation. The monopoly of coinage will enable it to make
this profit somewhat high= but it should be varied according
to the state of metallurgic science, and the demand for circu-
lation. Whenever the state has little to coin on its own ac-
count, it had better lower its charges, than let its machinery
and workmen remain idle; and, on the other hand, raise its
charges, when the influx of bullion is rapid and superabun-
dant. And in this, it would but imitate other manufacturers.
As to the bullion bought and coined by government on its
own account, the coin issued would reimburse the charges;
and yield a profit by its superior value in exchange; as I have
endeavoured to prove above, in Section 4

The power of a government to facilitate the transactions of
exchange and contract, wherein the commodity, money, is
employed, consists in dividing the metal into different pieces
of one or more grammes or centigrammes, in such a manner,
as to admit of instant calculation of the number of grammes a
given payment will require.

To the marks indicative of weight and quality, should of course
be superadded every device to prevent counterfeits.
It has been ascertained by the experiments of the Academy of
Sciences, that gold and silver resist friction better with a slight
mixture of alloy, than in a pure state. People versed in these
matters say, besides, that this complete purity cannot be ob-
tained, without a very expensive chemical process, that would
add greatly to the expense of coinage. There is no sort of
objection to mixing alloy, provided the proportion be signi-
fied by the impression, which should be nothing more than a
mere certificate of the weight and quality of the metal.
I have not occupied my reader’s time with any observations
on the relative proportion of gold to silver; nor was there any
occasion to do so. Having avoided any specification of their
value under any particular denomination, I shall pay no more
attention to the alternating variations of that value, than to
the fluctuations of the relative value of both to all other com-
modities. This must be left to regulate itself; for any attempt
to fix it would be vain. With Regard to obligations, they would
be dischargeable in the terms of contract= an undertaking to
pay 100 grammes of silver would be discharged by the trans-
fer of 100 grammes of silver; unless, at the lime of payment,
by mutual consent of the contracting parties, any other metal,
or goods at a rate agreed on, should be substituted in preference.

I make no mention of the terms franc, decime, centime, be-
cause those names should never have been given to the coin,
being, in fact, names indicative of nothing whatever. The laws
of France, instead of enacting that pieces called francs, shall
be coined, having the weight of 5 grammes of silver, should
have simply ordered a coinage of pieces of 5 grammes. In
which case, a letter of credit or bill of exchange, instead of
being drawn for, say 400 fr., would be for 2000 grammes of
silver of the standard of 9/10 silver to 1/10 alloy; or if pre-
ferred, for 130 grammes of gold of the same degree of purity;
and the payment would be the most simple imaginable; for
the pieces of coin, gold and silver, would be all fractions or
multiples of the gramme of metal of that standard.
It would be difficult to calculate the advantage, that would
accrue to industry in all its branches, from so simple an ar-
rangement; but some notion of it may be obtained, by consid-
ering the mischiefs that have resulted from a contrary system.
Not only has the relative pecuniary position of individuals
been repeatedly overset, and the best planned and most ben-
eficial productive enterprises altogether thwarted and rendered
abortive; but the interests of the public, as well as of private
persons, are, almost everywhere, subject to daily and hourly
aggression.

However, it would still be necessary to enact, that no sum
stipulated in grammes of silver or gold should be payable
otherwise than in coin, unless under a special proviso; else,
the debtor might discharge all claims in bullion of somewhat
109Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
A medium, composed entirely of either silver or gold, bear-
ing a certificate, pretending to none but its real intrinsic value,
and, consequently exempt from the caprice of legislation,
would hold out such advantages to every department of com-
merce, and to every class of society, that it could not fail to
obtain currency even in foreign countries. Thus, the nation,
that should issue it, would become a general manufacturer of
money for foreign consumption, and might derive from that
branch of manufacture no inconsiderable revenue. We read
in Le Blanc, 286 that a particular coin issued by St. Louis, and
called agnels d’or, from the figure of a lamb impressed upon
them, was in great request even among foreigners, and a
favourite money in commercial dealings, for the sole reason
that it invariably contained the same quantity of gold, from
the reign of St. Louis to that of Charles 6. 

ing that the monarch, though an avowed patron of literature,
was himself unable to write.

3. The coin was yet further from bearing any thing indicative
of the standard quality of the metal, and this was the thing
first encroached upon; for the sol in the reign of Philip I still
contained the same fractional weight of the livre as origi-
nally; but it was made up of 8 parts of silver to 4 copper,
instead of containing, as under the second race of monarchs,
12 oz. of fine silver, which was the then weight of the livre.
The very singular state of the actual money of England, and
the extraordinary circumstances, that have occurred in respect
to it since the first editions of this work appeared, have given
a decisive proof, that the mere want of an agent of circula-
tion, or, of the commodity, money, is sufficient to support a
paper-money absolutely destitute of security for its convert-
ibility at a high rate of value, or even at a par with metal,
provided it be limited in amount to the actual demand of cir-
culation. 287 Whence some English writers of great intelligence
in this branch of science have been led to conclude, that, since
the purposes of money call into action none of the physical
and metallic properties of its material, some substance less
costly than the precious metals, paper, for instance, may be
employed in them with good effect, if due attention be paid
to keep the amount of the paper within the demands of circu-
lation. The celebrated Ricardo, has, with this object, proposed
an ingenious plan, making the Bank or corporate body, in-
vested with the privilege of issuing the paper-money, liable
to pay in bullion for its notes on demand. A note, actually
convertible on demand into so much gold or silver bullion,
cannot fall in value below the value of the bullion it purports
to represent; and, on the other hand, so long as the issues of
the paper do not exceed the wants of circulation, the holder
will have no inducement to present it for conversion, because
the bullion, when obtained, would not answer the purposes
of circulation. If a casual interruption of confidence in the
paper should bring it for conversion in too large quantity, the
paper remaining in circulation must rise in value, in the ab-
sence of any other circulating medium, and there would be
an inducement to bring bullion to the bank to be converted
into paper. 288

Should France be so fortunate as to make this experiment, I
hope none of those who do me the honour to read this work,
will feel any regret at the drain of its money, to use the ex-
pression of certain persons, who neither know nor choose to
learn any thing of the matter. It is quite clear, that neither
silver nor gold coin will go out of the kingdom, without leav-
ing behind a value fully equivalent to the metal and the fash-
ion it bears. The trade and manufacture of jewellery for ex-
port are considered lucrative to the nation; yet they occasion
an outgoing of the precious metals. The beauty of the form
and pattern adds, to be sure, greatly to the price of the metal
thus exported; but the accuracy of assay and weight, and,
above all things, the maintenance of the coin at an invariable
standard of weight and quality, would be an equal recom-
mendation, and would undoubtedly be just as well paid for.
Should it be objected, that the same system was adopted by
Charlemagne, when he called a pound of silver a livre, and
that notwithstanding the coin has been since repeatedly dete-
riorated, until, at last, what was called a livre, contained, in
fact, but 96 gr., I answer:
1. That, neither in the time of Charlemagne, nor at any subse-
quent period, has there ever been a coin containing a pound
of silver; that the livre has always been a money of account,
an ideal measure. The silver coin of Charlemagne and his
successors, consisted of sols of silver, the sol being a frac-
tional part of the pound weight.

Section 10= A Copper and Base Metal 289 Coinage.

2. None of the coin has ever borne on the face of it the indica-
tion of the weight of metal it contained. There are extant in
the collections of medals many pieces coined in the reign of
Charlemagne. The impression was nothing more than the name
of the monarch, with the occasional addition of the name of
the town where the coin was struck, executed in very rude characters; which, indeed, is not to be wondered at, consider. The copper coin and that of base metal, are not, strictly speaking, money; for debts cannot be legally tendered in this coin,
except such fractional sums, as are too minute to be paid in gold or silver. Gold and silver are the only metal-money of almost all commercial nations. Copper coin is a kind of transferable security, a sign or representative of a quantity of silver too diminutive to be worth the coinage; and, as such, the
government, that issues it, should always exchange it on de-
mand for silver, when tendered to an amount equal to the
smallest piece of silver coin. Otherwise, there is no security
against the issue of an excess beyond the demand of circula-
tion.

As long as a government gives silver on demand for the cop-
per and base metal regularly presented, it can with little in-
convenience give them very trifling intrinsic value; the de-
mand for circulation will always absorb a very large quantity,
and they will maintain their value as fully, as if really worth
the fractional silver represented; on exactly the same prin-
ciple, as a bank-note passes current, and that too for years
together, without any intrinsic value, just as well as if really
worth the sum it purports on the face of it to contain. In this
manner, such a coinage can be made more profitable to the
government than by any compulsion to receive it in part pay-
ment; and the value of the legal coin will suffer no deprecia-
tion. The only danger is that of counterfeits, which there is
the strongest stimulus for avarice to fabricate, in proportion
as the difference between the intrinsic, and the current value,
grows wider.

Whenever there is such an excess, the holders, finding the
base metal less advantageous than the gold and silver it rep-
resents but does not equal in value, would strive to get rid of
it in every way; whether by selling to a loss, or by employing
it in preference to pay for low-priced articles, which would
consequently rise in nominal price; or by proffering it to their
creditors in larger quantity, than enough to make up the frac-
tional part of sums in account. The government, having an
interest in preventing its being at a discount, because that
would reduce the profit upon all future issues, generally au-
thorizes the latter expedient.

The last King of Sardinia’s predecessor, in attempting to with-
draw from circulation a base currency, issued by his father in
a period of calamity, had more than thrice the quantity origi-
nally issued by the government thrown upon his hands. The
same thing happened to the king of Prussia, when, under the
assumed name of the Jew Ephraim, he withdrew the base coin
he had compelled the Saxons to receive, during his distresses
in the seven years’ war; 290 and for exactly the same reason.
Counterfeits of the coin are usually executed beyond the na-
tional frontier. In England it was attempted to remedy this
evil in the year 1799, by a coinage of half-pence with a very
fine impression, and executed with an attention and perfec-
tion, that counterfeiters can rarely bestow.

Before 1808, for instance, it was a legal tender at Paris to the
extent of 1/40 of every sum due; which had exactly the same
effect, as a partial debasement of the national currency. Ev-
ery body knew, when a bargain was concluded, that he was
liable to be paid in proportion of 1/40 copper or brass metal,
to 39/40 silver, and made his calculation accordingly, on terms
proportionably higher, than if no such regulation had existed.
It is with this particular, precisely as with the weight and stan-
dard of the silver coin; sellers do not stop to weigh and assay
every piece they receive, but the dealers in gold and silver,
and those connected with the trade, are perpetually on the
watch to compare the intrinsic, with the current, value of the
coin; and, whenever their values differ, they have an oppor-
tunity of gain; their operations to obtain which, have a con-
stant tendency to put the current value of the coin on a level
with its real value.

Section 11= The preferable Form of Coined Money.

The wear of the coin by friction is proportionate to the extent
of its surface. Of two pieces of coin of equal weight and qual-
ity, that will suffer least from continual use, which offers the
least surface to the friction.
The obligation to receive copper in any considerable propor-
tion, has, in like manner, an influence upon the exchange with
foreigners. There is no question, that a letter of exchange on
Paris payable in francs is sold cheaper at Amsterdam, in con-
sequence of the liability to receive part payment in copper or
base metal; just as it would be, if the franc were made to
contain less of silver and more of alloy.
The spherical or globular form is, consequently, preferable
in this respect, as least liable to wear; but it has been rejected
on account of its inconvenience.
Yet, it is to be observed, that, on the whole, the value of money
is not so much affected by this circumstance, as by the mix-
ture of alloy; for the alloy has positively no value whatever,
for the reasons above stated; whereas, the copper money,
payable in the ratio of 1/40, had a small intrinsic value, though
inferior to the sum in silver, it was made to pass for= had it
been of equal value, there would have been no occasion for
an express law to give it currency.
Next to this form, the cylinder, of equal depth and breadth, is
that, which exposes the smallest surface; but this is fully as
inconvenient as the other; the form of a very flat cylinder has,
consequently, been very generally adopted. However, from
what has been already said, it will appear, that the less it is
flattened the better; and that the coin should rather be made
thick than broad.

when the diminution is discovered, it may be impossible to
tell, by which of the innumerable holders it was effected. I
am aware, that each of them has imperceptibly shared the
depreciation of its exchangeable value, occasioned by the
wear; that the quantity of goods it would purchase has de-
clined by an insensible gradation; that, although the depre-
ciation has been imperceptibly progressive, it becomes at last
very manifest; and that worn money will not be taken at par
with new coin. Consequently, I think, that, if an entire class
of coin were gradually so reduced as to make a re-coinage
necessary, its holders could not in reason expect that their
reduced coin should be exchanged for new at par, piece for
piece. Their money should be received, even by the govern-
ment, at no more than its real value; the silver it contains is
less in quantity than at the first issue; and it has been received
by the holders at a lower rate of value; they have given for it
less goods than they would have done in the outset.
With regard to the impression, the chief requisites are, 1. That
it specify the weight and quality of the piece; 2. That it be
very distinct, and intelligible to the meanest capacity; 3. That
the die oppose all possible difficulties to the defacing or re-
ducing of the coin; that is to say, that it be so contrived, that
neither the ordinary wear nor fraudulent practices should be
able to reduce the weight without destroying the impression.
The last coined English half-pence have a cord, not project-
ing, but indented in the thickness of the circumference, and
occupying the central part of the circumference only, so as to
make it liable neither to clipping nor wear. This mode might
be adopted in the silver and gold coinage with certainty and
success; and it is of much more consequence to prevent their
deterioration.
When the impression is in basso relievo, it should project but
little, for the convenience of piling the pieces one upon an-
other, as well as to reduce the friction. On the same account a
projecting impression should not be too sharp on the surface,
or it would wear away too rapidly. With a view to prevent
this, experiments have been made of dies executed in alto
relievo; but it was found that the coin was thereby too much
weakened, and liable to be bent or broken. This plan, how-
ever, might possibly be practised with advantage, if the pieces
were secured by greater thickness.
In fact this is the course that rigid justice would prescribe;
but there are two reasons, why it should not be strictly en-
forced.
1. Each individual piece of coin is not, if I may be allowed
the expression, a substantive article of commerce. Its ex-
changeable value is calculated, not according to the weight
and quality of the identical piece in question, but according
to the average weight and quality of the coin in large quanti-
ties, as ascertained by common experience. A crown piece of
an earlier date, and more worn, is yet freely received in ex-
change for one more new and perfect; the difference is sunk
in the average. The mint issues new pieces every year of the
full weight and standard, which prevents the coin from de-
clining sensibly in value, in consequence of the friction, even
for many years after its issue.
The same motive of giving to the coin the least possible sur-
face, should induce the government to issue as large pieces
as convenience will admit; for the more pieces there are, the
greater is the surface exposed to friction. No more small pieces
of coin should be issued, than just enough to transact ex-
changes of small amount, and to pay fractional sums. All large
sums should be paid in large pieces of coin.
This circumstance is illustrated by the fact, of the French
pieces of 12 and 24 sous passing current at par with the crown-
pieces of 6 livres without any difficulty; although the same
nominal sum, in the shape of the worn pieces of 12 and 24s.,
contained in reality about ¼ less silver than the crown-piece.

Section 12= The Party, on whom the Loss of the Coin
by Wear should properly fall.

It has been a question, who ought to defray the loss, conse-
quent upon the friction or wear of the coin? In strict justice,
the person who had made use of it, in like manner as the
wearer of ayjv other commodity. A man, that re-sells a coat
after having worn it, sells it for less than he gave for it when
new. So a man, that sells a crown-piece for some other com-
modity, should sell it for less than he gave; that is to say,
should receive a smaller quantity of goods than he obtained it
with.

The subsequent law, which prohibited their being taken by
the public receivers or private persons at more than 10 and
20 sous, rated them at their full intrinsic value, but below the
rate, at which the then holders had taken them. For their value
had been previously kept up to 12 and 24 sous in spite of the
wear, by reason of their passing current at par with the crown-
piece. Thus, the last holder was saddled with the entire loss
of a friction, to which the innumerable hands they had passed
through had all contributed.

But the portion of a specific coin, consumed in its passage
through the hands of any one honest person, is less than al-
most any assignable value. It may circulate for many years
together, without any sensible diminution of its weight; and,
2. The impression is equally effectual in giving currency at
the last as at the first, although it becomes in course of time scarcely, if at all visible; witness the shillings of England.
The coin derives, as above explained, a certain degree of value
from the mere impression, which value has been admitted
and recognised throughout, until it reaches the ultimate holder,
who has in consequence received it at a higher rate, than he
would a piece of blank bullion of equal weight. To saddle
him with the difference, would be to make him lose the whole
value of the impression, although it has been equally service-
able to perhaps a million of others. The right conveyed by the assignment of these engagements,
though not capable of being enforced immediately, or else-
where than at the stipulated place, yet gives them an actual
value, greater or less, according to circumstances. Thus a bill
of exchange for 100 dollars, payable at Paris at two months’
date, may be negotiated or sold, at pleasure, at the rate of, say
99 dollars, while a letter of credit of like amount, payable at
Marseilles in the same space of time, will, perhaps, be worth
at Paris but 98 dollars.

On these grounds, I am inclined to think, the loss by wear,
and that of the impression, should be borne by the commu-
nity at large; that is to say, by the public purse= for the whole
society derives the benefit of the money; and it is impossible
to tax each individual, in the precise proportion of the use he
has made of it. These engagements may be used as money in all transactions
of purchase, as soon as they are invested with actual present
value, by the prospect of their future value; indeed, most of
the greater operations of commerce are effected through the
medium of these securities.

Sometimes, the circumstance of a bill of exchange being pay-
able at another place will increase, instead of diminishing its
value; but this depends upon the state of commerce for the
time being. If the merchants of Paris have large payments to
make to those of London, they will readily give more money
at Paris for a bill upon London, than it will produce to the
holder at the latter place. Thus, although the pound sterling
contain precisely as much silver as 24 fr. 74 cents, they will,
perhaps, give at Paris 25 fr., more or less, for every pound
sterling payable in London. 291

To conclude= every individual, that carries bullion to the mint
to be coined may be fairly charged the expenses of the pro-
cess, and, if thought advisable, the full monopoly-profit. Thus
far there is no harm done= his bullion is increased in value to
the full amount of what he has been charged by the mint;
otherwise, he would never have carried it thither. At the same
time, I am of opinion, that the mint should always give a new
piece in exchange for an old one on demand= which need
nowise interfere with the utmost possible precautions against
the clipping and debasing of the coin. The mint should refuse
such pieces as have lost certain parts of the impression, which
are not liable to fair and unavoidable wear; and the loss in
that case should fall on the individual, careless enough to
take a piece thus palpably deficient. The promptitude, with
which the public would take care to carry injured or suspi-
cious pieces to the mint, would greatly facilitate the detec-
tion of fraudulent practices.

This is what is called the course of exchange, being, in fact, a
mere specification of the quantity of precious metal people
will consent to give, for the transfer of a right to receive a
given quantity of the same metal at any other specified place.
The particular locality of the metal reduces or increases its
value, in relation to the same metal situated elsewhere.
The exchange is said to be in favour of any country, France,
for example, whenever less of the precious metal is there given
for, than will be produced by, a bill of exchange upon another
country; or whenever in the foreign country more of the pre-
cious metal is given for a bill of exchange on France, than it
will there produce to the holder. The difference is never very
considerable, and cannot exceed the charge of transporting
the precious metal itself; for, if a foreigner, who wants to make
a payment at Paris, can remit the sum in specie at less ex-
pense than he could be put to by the existing course of ex-
change, he would undoubtedly remit in specie. 292
With diligence on the part of the executive, the loss arising
from this source might be reduced to a mere trifle, and the
system of national money would be materially improved, as
well as the foreign exchange.
