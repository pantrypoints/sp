People imagine that all debts to foreigners can be paid by bills of exchange; and measures have been frequently suggested, and sometimes adopted, for the encouragement of this fictitious mode of payment. 

But this is a mere delusion. 

A bill of exchange has no intrinsic value; it can only be drawn upon any place for a sum actually due at
that place; and no sum can be there actually due, unless an
equal value, in some shape or other, has been remitted thither:
the imports of a nation can only be paid by the national export; and vice versa. Bills of exchange are a mere representative of sums due; in other words, the merchants of one country can draw bills on those of another for no more, than the full amount of the goods of every description, silver and gold
included, which they may have sent thither directly or indi-
rectly. 

If one country, say France, have remitted to another
country, Germany perhaps, merchandise to the value of 2
millions of dollars, and the latter have remitted to the former
to the amount of 3 millions of dollars, France can pay as much
as 2 millions by the means of bills of exchange, representing
the value of her export; but the remaining 1 million cannot be
so discharged directly, although possibly they may by bills of
exchange upon a third country, Italy, for instance, whither
she may have exported goods to that extent.


## Section 1. Bills of Exchange and Letters of Credit

A bill of exchange, a promissory note or check, and a letter of credit, are written obligations to pay, or cause to be paid, a sum of money, either at a future time, or at a different place.


Accommodation-paper actually represents no value. A merchant at Paris, in league with another of
Hamburgh, draws bills upon his correspondent, which the
latter pays or provides for, by re-drawing and negotiating or
selling bills at Hamburgh upon his correspondent at Paris. So
long as these bills are in possession of any third person, that
third person has advanced their value. The negotiation of such
accommodation-paper is an expedient for borrowing, and a
very expensive one; for it entails the loss of the banker’s com-
mission, brokerage and other incidental charges, over and
above the discount for the time the bills have to run. Paper of
this description can never wipe out the debt, that one nation
owes another; for the bills drawn on one side balance and
extinguish those on the other. The Hamburgh bills will natu-
rally counterpoise those of Paris, being in fact drawn to meet
them; the second set destroys the first, and the result is abso-
lute nullity.


## Section 2: Banks of Deposit

The constant intercourse between a small state and its
neighbours occasions a perpetual influx of foreign coin. For,
although the small state may have a national coinage of its
own, yet, the frequent necessity of taking the foreign instead
of the national coin in payment, requires the fixation of the
ratio of their relative value, in the current transactions of business.

There are many mischiefs attending the use of foreign coin,
arising chiefly from the great variation of weight and quality.
It is often extremely old, worn, and defaced; not having par-
ticipated in the general re-coinage of the nation that issued it,
where, perhaps, it is no longer current; all which circum-
stances, though considered in settling its current relative value
to the local coin, yet, do not quite reduce it to the natural
level of depreciation.

Bills drawn from abroad upon such a state, being payable in
the coin thus rendered current, are, in consequence, negoti-
ated abroad at some loss; and those drawn upon foreign coun-
tries, and, consequently, payable in coin of a more steady and
intelligible value, are negotiated in a smaller state at a pre-
mium, because the holder of them must have purchased them
in a depreciated currency. In short, the foreign coin is always
exchanged for the local currency to a loss.
Thus it is evident, that one nation cannot otherwise discharge
its debts to another, than by remittance of actual value in goods
or commodities, in which term I comprise the precious met-
als, amongst others, to the full amount of what it has received
or owes. If the actual values directly remitted thither are in-
sufficient to balance the receipts or imports thence, it may
remit to a third nation, and thence transport produce enough
to make up the deficit. How does France pay Russia for the
hemp and timber for ship-building imported thence? By re-
mittance of wines, brandies, silks, not merely to Russia, but,
likewise to Hamburgh and Amsterdam, whence again a re-
mittance of colonial and other commercial produce is for-
warded to Russia.

The remedy devised by states of this inferior class is the sub-
ject of the present section. They established banks, 294 where
private merchants could lodge any amount of local national
coin, of bullion, or of foreign coin, reckoned by the bank as
bullion; and the amount, so lodged, was entered as so much
money of the legal national standard of weight and quality.
At the same time, the bank opened an account with each mer-
chant making such deposit, giving him credit for the amount
of the deposit. Whenever a merchant wanted to make a payment, there was no occasion to touch the deposit at all; it was
sufficient to transfer the sum required, from the credit of the
party paying. to that of the party receiving. Thus values could
be transferred continually by a mere transfer in the books of
the bank. The whole operation was conducted without any
actual transfer of specie; the original deposit, which was en-
tered at the real intrinsic value at the time of making it, re-
mained as security for the credit transferred from one person
to another; and the specie, so lodged with the bank, was ex-
empt from any reduction of value by wear, fraud, or even
legislative enactment.

Governments have commonly made it their object to con-
trive that the precious metals shall form the largest possible
portion of the national import from, and the least possible portion of the national export to, foreign countries. I have already taken occasion to remark, with regard to what is improperly called the balance of trade, that, if the national merchant finds the precious metals a more profitable foreign re-
mittance than another commodity, it is likewise the interest
of the state to remit in that form; for the state can only gain
and lose in the persons of its individual subjects; and, in the
matter of foreign commerce, whatever is best for the indi-
viduals in the aggregate, is best for the state also. 293 Thus,
when impediments are thrown in the way of the export of the
precious metals by individuals, the effect is to compel an ex-
port in some other shape, less advantageous to the individual
and the public too.



Section 3= Banks of Circulation or Discount, and of Bank-notes, or Convertible Paper.

Bills of exchange, payable in a currency so little liable to injury or fluctuation, must be
negotiable on better than ordinary terms. In fact, it was ob-
servable, that on the whole, the course of exchange was rather
in favour of the countries that paid in bank, and unfavourable
to those that paid in circulating money only. There is another kind of bank, founded on totally different
principles; consisting of associated capitalists, subscribing a
capital in transferable shares, to be employed in various profitable ways, but chiefly in the discount of promissory notes
and bills of exchange, that is to say, the advance of the value
of commercial paper not yet due, with the deduction of interest for the time it has to run, which is called, the discount.
The bank retained the deposities in perpetuity; for the re-is-
sue would have been attended with serious loss; inasmuch as
it would have been the same thing, as producing good money
of the full original value, to be taken at par with the deterio-
rated circulating coin, which passes current for — not its in-
trinsic, but its average weight. The coin withdrawn from the
bank would have been mixed up with the mass of circulation,
and passed current at par with the rest. So that the withdraw-
ing such deposits would have been a gratuitous sacrifice of
the excess of value of bank above circulating money. These companies, with a view to enlarge their capital and
extend their business, commonly issue notes, purporting to
bear a promise to pay to the bearer on demand, the gold or
silver specified on the face of them. Their security for the
due discharge of these engagements is, the commercial paper
held by the bank, and subscribed by individuals in solvent
circumstances; for the company gives its notes in discount,
or, what is the same thing, in purchase of this paper.

The private commercial paper, indeed, having a term to run
before it falls due, can not be available in discharge of notes
payable on demand; for which reason, every well-conducted
bank of circulation confines its advances of cash, or notes
payable in cash on demand, to the discount of bills at very
short dates, and is careful to have always in hand a consider-
able amount of specie, probably a third, or as much as the
half of the total amount of their circulating notes; and, even
with all possible caution, it is at times greatly embarrassed,
whenever a want of confidence in its solvency, or any unto-
ward event, causes a sudden run upon the bank for cash. The
bank of England has been obliged, on an occasion of this
kind, to scrape together as many sixpences as it possibly could
find, to gain time by the delay inseparable from payments in
such a diminutive coin, until a part of the paper in its possession had fallen due. The discount bank of Paris in 1788, being then under control of government, had recourse
to similar paltry expedients. 



This is the nature of banks of deposit; most of which com-
bined other operations with the primary object of their insti-
tution; but of them I shall speak elsewhere. They derived their
profits, partly from a duty levied upon every transfer, and
partly from operations incident to, and compatible with, their
institution; as, for example, advances made upon a deposit of
bullion.

The inviolability of the deposit, confided to them, is essential to the success of such establishments. At
Amsterdam, the four burgomasters, or municipal magistrates,
were trustees for the creditors. Annually, on leaving office,
they handed over the trust to their successors, who, after in-
specting the account, and verifying it by the registers of the
bank, bound themselves by oath, to surrender their charge inviolate to their successors in office. This trust was scrupu-
lously executed from the first establishment of the bank in
1609 until 1672, when the forces of Louis XIV penetrated as
far as Utrecht. The deposits were then faithfully restored to
the individuals. It would seem to have been afterwards less
scrupulously managed; for, when the French took possession
of that capital, in 1794, and called for a statement of the con-
cern, it was found to be in advance of no less a sum than
10,624,793 florins to the India company, and to the prov-
inces of Holland and West Friezeland, which were wholly
unable to repay it. In a country governed by a power without
control or responsibility, it may be expected, that such a de-
posit would have been still more exposed to violation. 295
The money still remaining in circulation, wherever it was
exchanged for the bank deposits, that is to sav, for entries in
the bank books, necessarily lost in proportion to the reduc-
tion of its intrinsic value. And this loss occasioned the differ-
ence of value, or agio at Amsterdam, between bank money
and circulating money, which was on the average from 3 to 4
per cent. in favour of the former.




The profits of banks of circulation are very considerable; that
portion of the notes, which is issued on the credit of private
commercial paper, continues running at interest; for the ad-
vances have been made with the deduction of the discount.
But the portion of the paper, issued on the credit of the specie
in reserve, brings no profit; the interest lying dormant in the
specie thus withdrawn from circulation.
A bank of circulation affords the advantage of economizing
capital, by reducing the amount of the sum, kept in reserve
for the current and contingent expenses of the individuals it
accommodates.

The banks of England and France make no advances to pri-
vate persons, except on bills of exchange, and give no credit
beyond the funds in hand. They indemnify themselves for the
trouble oi receiving and paying on account of individuals by
turning to account the floating balance left in their hands.
These two establishments have, besides, undertaken the busi-
ness of paying the interest upon the respective national debts,
receiving an allowance fol their trouble= furthermore, they
occasionally make advances to the governments.
Bank bills or notes, payable on demand, and circulating as
cash play so important a part in the progress of national wealth,
and have engendered such important errors in the brain of
many writers of repute and information on other topics, that
it will be worth while to examine their nature and conse-
quences in a very particular manner.
I should premise, that the residue of this section applies ex-
clusively to bank-notes, depending solely upon the credit of
the bank for their currency, and convertible at pleasure into
cash or specie.

From these various operations, they derive a great increase
of their profits. The one last mentioned, however, is com-
pletely at variance with the purposes of their establishment,
as we shall presently find. The advances made to the old gov-
ernment of France by the then bank of discount, and those of
the bank of England to the English government, compelled
those bodies to apply to the respective legislatures to give
their notes a compulsory circulation; thus destroying their
fundamental requisites of convertibility. The consequence has
been, that the former of these banks went all to pieces.
It is a matter of no less curiosity than of importance, to in-
quire whether bark-notes, or paper destitute of intrinsic value,
be any addition to the stock of national wealth, and what, if
any, is the possible extent of that addition; for, were there no
limits to it, there could be no end to the wealth, that a state
might acquire in a short time by the mere fabrication of some
reams of paper. The solution of this grand problem may be
set down as one of Smith’s happiest efforts; yet it is not every
body that comprehends his reasoning; I will try to render it
more generally intelligible.
The establishment of several banks, for the issue of convert-
ible notes, is more beneficial than the investment of any single
body with the exclusive privilege; for the competition obliges
each of them to court the public favour, by a rivalship of ac-
commodation and solidity.

The wants of a nation require a certain supply of such par-
ticular commodity, and the extent of that supply is determined
by the relative prosperity of the nation for the time being. A
surplus of each of those commodities beyond this demand is
either not produced at all, or, if produced, must occasion a
decline of relative local value= it, therefore, naturally finds its
way out of the country, and goes in quest of a market, where
it may be in higher estimation.
Banks of circulation issue their notes either in the discount oi
promissory notes or bills of exchange, that is to say, in giving
their notes payable on demand, and circulating like cash, in
exchange for private paper payable at a future date, upon
which interest is deduct. ed; which is the course pursued by
the present bank of France, and by all the English banks. public
and private; or else in lending at interest to solvent individu-
als, like those of Scotland. Merchants of good credit are, in
the latter way, supplied with the sums necessary for their cur-
rent expenses and payments, and each of them is thereby en-
abled to embark his whole capital in his commercial enter-
prises, without being obliged to reserve any part to meet the
calls upon him in the course of business. The merchant of
Paris or London must contrive matters, so as to have always
on hand either in his private coffers or in the bank, a sum sufficient to face the demands upon him; whereas, the merchant of Edinburgh is relieved from this necessity, and at liberty to invest the whole of his funds, in the confidence that the bank will advance him the money he may happen to require.

Money is, in this respect, like all other commodities; it is a
convenient agent, and, therefore, employed as such in all
operations of exchange; but the intensity of the demand for it
is determined in each community, by the relative extent and
activity of the exchanges negotiated within it. As soon as there
is a supply of money sufficient to circulate all the commodi-
ties there are to be circulated, no more money is imported; or,
if a surplus flow in, it emigrates again in quest of a market,
where its value is greater, or where its utility is more desired.

It is seldom or never that any body keeps in his purse or his coffers more specie than enough to meet the current demands of his business or consumption. 297 Every excess beyond these
demands is rejected, as bearing neither utility nor interest;
and the community at large is fully supplied with specie, as
soon as each individual is possessed of the portion suitable to
his condition and relative station in society.
be replaced by circulating notes= but this is a monstrous pro-
portion; particularly if it be considered, that paper cannot re-
tain its value as money any longer than while it is readily and
instantly convertible into specie; I say, readily and instantly,
because otherwise people would prefer specie, which is at all
times, and without the least hesitation, taken for money. To
insure this requisite convertibility, it is necessary, that, be-
sides having at all times a fund in reserve, in private bills or
securities, or in specie, sufficient to meet all the notes that
may be presented, the bank itself should be at all times within
the reach of the holders of its notes. Therefore, if the territory
be of any extent, and the notes so generally circulated, as to
form half of the circulating medium, the subordinate offices
of the bank must be greatly multiplied to place them within
reach of all the note-holders.

It may be safely left to private interest, to make the best use
of the excess of specie beyond the demand for circulation.
The notion that every item of specie, that crosses the frontier,
is so much dead loss to the community, is just as absurd as
the supposition, that a manufacturer is so much the poorer,
every time he parts with his money in the purchase of the
ingredient or raw material of his manufacture; or that indi-
viduals, the aggregate of whom makes up the nation, present
foreigners gratuitously with all the money they part with.
But, granting the possibility of such an arrangement, and ad-
mitting, that paper might supplant as much as half the requi-
site national currency of specie, let us see what would be the
amount of the acquisition to the national capital.

Taking it for granted, then, that the specie, remaining in circulation within the community, is limited by the national demand for circulating medium; if any expedient can be devised, for substituting bank-notes in place of half the specie or the commodity, money, there will evidently be a superabundance of metal-money, and that superabundance must be followed by a diminution of its relative value. 

But, as such diminution in one place by no means implies a contemporaneous diminution in other places, where the expedient of banknotes is not resorted to, and where, consequently, no such
superabundance of the commodity, money, exists, money
naturally resorts thither, and is attracted to the spot where it
bears the highest relative value, or is exchangeable for the
largest quantity of other goods= in other words, it flows to the
markets where commodities are the cheapest, and is replaced
by goods, of value equal to the money exported.
No writer of repute has ventured to estimate the requisite cir-
culating specie of any nation, higher than 1/5 of the annual
national product; some, indeed, have reckoned it as low as 1/
30. Taking the highest estimate, viz. 1/5 of the annual prod-
uct, which, for my own part, I consider greatly above the re-
ality in any case; a nation, whose annual product should
amount to 20 millions, would need but 4 millions of specie.
Therefore, in case the half, or 2 millions, were supplanted by
circulating paper, and employed in augmenting the national
productive capital, that capital would be once for all aug-
mented, by a value equal to 2/20 or 1/10 of the annual prod-
uct of the nation.

The money that can emigrate in this manner, is that part only
of the circulating medium, which has a value elsewhere than
within the limits of the nation; that is to say, the specie or
metal-money. Since, however, specie does not emigrate with-
out an equivalent return; and, since its value, which before
existed in the shape of specie, and was exclusively engaged
in facilitating circulation, thenceforth assumes the form of a
variety of commodities, all items of the reproductive national
capital, there follows this remarkable consequence. that the
national capital is enlarged to the full amount of all the specie
exported upon the introduction of the substitute. Nor is the
internal national circulation at all cramped for want of money
by this export; for the functions of the specie, that has been
withdrawn, are just as well performed by the paper substi-
tuted in its stead.

Again, the annual product of a nation would, probably, be
much overrated at 1/10 of the gross national productive capi-
tal; but let it be set down at that rate, allowing 5 per cent
interest on productive capital, and 5 per cent wages and prof-
its of the industry it sets in motion. On this calculation, sup-
posing the paper substitute to add to the national capital, in
the ratio of 1/10 of its annual product, this addition will not at
the highest estimate exceed 1/100, of the previous capital.
Although the practicable issue of bank-notes procures to a
nation of moderate wealth an accession of capital, much less
considerable than people may fondly imagine, this accession
is, notwithstanding, of very great value; for, unless the pro-
ductive energy of the nation be extremely great, as in Great
Britain, or the national spirit of frugality very general and
persevering, as in Holland, the annual savings withdrawn from
unproductive consumption, to be added to productive capi-
tal, form, even in thriving states, a very inconsiderable por-
tion of the gross annual revenue. Nations, whose production
However valuable an acquisition the national capital may thus
receive, it must not be rated above its real amount. I have
supposed, for the sake of simplicity, that half the specie might 
is stationary, as every body knows, make no addition to their
productive capitals; and the consumption of those on the de-
cline annually encroaches on their capitals.

machinery, for the digging of mines or canals, for the bring-
ing of waste land into cultivation, or the commencement of
long-winded speculations; any funds, in short, to be employed
as vested capital. The indispensable requisite of credit-paper
is, its instant convertibility into specie; when the sum total of
the paper issued does not exist in the coffers of the bank,
under the shape of specie, the deficit should at least be sup-
plied by securities of very short dates; whereas, an establish-
ment, that should lend its funds to be vested in enterprises,
whence they could not be withdrawn at pleasure, could never
be prepared with such securities. An example will illustrate
this position. Suppose a bank of circulation to lend 6,000
dollars of its notes, circulating as cash, to a landholder on
mortgage of his land, presenting the amplest security. This
loan is destined by the landholder to the construction of nec-
essary buildings, for the cultivation of the estate; for which
purpose he contracts with a builder and pays him the 6,000
dollars of notes advanced by the bank. Now, if the builder,
after a short lapse of time, be desirous of turning the notes
into specie, the bank can not pay him by a transfer of the
mortgage. The only property the bank has to meet the 6,000
dollars of notes is a security, ample beyond-doubt, but not
available at the moment.

Should the paper-issues of a bank at any time exceed the de-
mands of circulation, and the credit enjoyed by the establish-
ment, there follows a perpetual reflux of its notes, and it is
put to the expense of collecting specie, which is absorbed as
fast as collected. The Scotch banks, though productive of great
benefit, have been obliged, upon such trying occasions, to
keep agents in London constantly employed, in scraping
specie together at a charge of two per cent., which specie was
instantly absorbed. The bank of England, in similar circum-
stances, was under the necessity of buying gold bullion, and
getting it coined; and this coin was melted again as fast as it
was paid by the bank, in consequence of the high price of the
metal, which was itself the effect of the constant purchases
made by the bank, to meet the calls upon it for specie. In this
manner, it sustained the annual loss of from 2½ to 3 per cent,
upon a sum of about £850,000, 298 more than 20 millions of
our money. I say nothing of the situation of this bank of late
years, since its notes have acquired a forced circulation, and,
consequently, altered their nature entirely.
The securities in the hands of a bank, I hold to be a solid
basis for the whole of its issues of notes, provided those se-
curities be of solvent persons, and have not too long to run;
for the securities will be redeemed either with specie, or with
the notes of the bank itself. In the first case, the bank is sup-
plied with the means of paying its notes; in the second, it is
saved the trouble of providing for them.

The notes issued by a bank of circulation, even if it have no
funds of its own, are never issued gratuitously; and, there-
fore, of course, imply the existence, in the coffers of the bank,
of a value of like amount, either in the shape of specie, or of
securities, bearing interest; upon which latter only the whole
real advance of the bank is made; and this advance can never
be made upon securities that have a long time to run; for the
securities are the fund, that is to provide for the discharge of
another class of securities, in the hands of the public at large,
payable at the shortest of all possible notice, namely, on de-
mand. Strictly speaking, a bank can not be at all times in a
condition to face the calls upon it, and deserve the entire con-
fidence of the public, unless the private paper it has dis-
counted, be all, like its own notes, payable on demand; but,
as it is no easy matter to find substantial assets, that shall bear
interest, and at the same time be redeemable at sight, the next
best course is to confine its issues to bills of very short dates;
and, indeed, well-conducted banks have always rigidly ad-
hered to this principle.

If, by any circumstance, the notes be deprived of their power
of circulating as specie, the task of replacing the metal for the
paper. money does not devolve upon the bank; nor was it at
the first saddled with the business of turning to account the
metal-money its notes rendered superfluous. For, as we have
already observed, the bank can extinguish the whole of its
paper with the private securities it holds. The inconvenience
falls upon the public, which is under the necessity of finding
a new agent of circulation, either by a re-import of the metal-
money, or by the substitution of private paper; but probably
the public would, in such circumstances, apply again to a bank
conducted on sound principles. 299

From the preceding considerations may be deduced a con-
clusion, fatal to abundance of systems and projects, viz., that
credit-paper can supplant, and that but partially, nothing more
than that portion of the national capital performing the func-
tions of money, which circulates from hand to hand, as an
agent for the facility of transfer; consequently, that no bank
of circulation, or credit-paper of any de nomination what-
ever, can supply to agricultural, manufacturing, or commer-
cial enterprise, any funds for the construction of ships or
This will serve to explain, why so many schemes of agricul-
tural banks for the issue of circulating and convertible notes
on ample landed security, and so many other schemes of a
similar nature, have fallen to the ground in very little time,
with more or less loss to the shareholders and the public. 300
Specie is equivalent to paper of perfect solidity, and payable
at the moment; consequently it can only be supplanted by
notes of unquestionable credit, and payable on demand; and 
and ingenious metaphor. The capital of a nation he likens to
an extensive tract of country, whereupon the cultivated dis-
tricts represent the productive capital, and the high roads the
agent of circulation, that is to say, the money, that serves as
the medium to distribute the produce among the several
branches of society. He then supposes a machine to be in-
vented, for transporting the produce of the land through the
air; that machine would be the exact parallel of credit-paper.
Thenceforward the high roads might be devoted to
cultivation.’The commerce and industry of the country, how-
ever,’ he continues, ‘though they may be somewhat aug-
mented, cannot be altogether so secure, when they are thus,
as it were, suspended upon the Daedalian wings of paper-
money, as when they travel about upon the solid ground of
gold and silver. Over and above the accidents, to which they
are exposed from the unskilfulness of the conductors of this
paper-money, they are liable to several others, from which no
prudence or skill of those conductors can guard them. An
unsuccessful war, for example, in which the enemy get pos-
session of the capital, and consequently of that treasure, which
supported the credit of the paper-money, would occasion a
much greater confusion in a country, where the whole circu-
lation was carried on by paper, than in one, where the greater
part of it was carried on by gold and silver The usual instru-
ment of commerce having lost its value, no exchanges could
be made except by barter or upon credit. All taxes having
usually been paid in paper-money, the prince would not have
wherewithal either to pay his troops, or to furnish his maga-
zines; and the state of the country would be much more irre-
trievable, than if the greater part of its circulation had con-
sisted in gold and silver. A prince, anxious to maintain his
dominions at all times in the state in which he can most easily
defend them, ought upon this account to guard, not only
against that excessive multiplication of paper money, which
ruins the very banks which issue it, but even against that mul-
tiplication of it, which enables them to fill the greater part of
the circulation of the country with it.’ 303
such notes cannot be discharged by a bare security, even of
the best possible kind.

For the same reason, bills of exchange in the nature of ac-
commodation-paper, as it is called, can never be a sound ba-
sis for an issue of convertible paper. Such bills of exchange
are paid when due by fresh bills, that have a further term to
run, and are negotiated with the deduction of discount. When
the latter fall due, they are met by a third set payable at a still
later date, which are discounted in like manner. If the bank
discounts such bills, the operation is no more than an expedi-
ent for borrowing of the bank in perpetuity; the first loan be-
ing paid with a second, the second with the third, and so on.
And the bank experiences the evil of issuing more of its notes,
than the circulation will naturally absorb, and the credit of
the establishment will support; for the notes, borrowed upon
such bills, do not help to circulate and diffuse real value, be-
cause they represent and contain no real value themselves;
consequently, they continually recur to be exchanged for
specie. It is on this account, that the discount-bank of Paris,
while it continued to be well administered, did, as the present
banks of France and England do still refuse, as far as it is
able, to discount accommodation-paper.

The consequences are similar and equally mischievous, when
a bank makes advances to government in perpetuity, or even
for a very long period. 301 This was the cause of the failure of
the bank of England. Not being able to obtain payment from
government, it was unable to withdraw the notes in which the
loan was made. From that moment its notes ceased to be con-
vertible; and until the resumption of cash payments in 1822,
enjoyed a forced circulation. The government, being itself
unable to supply the bank with the means of payment, dis-
charged that body from its liability to its own creditors. 302
The holders of the notes of a bank issuing convertible money
run little or no risk, so long as the bank is well administered,
and independent of the government. Supposing a total failure
of confidence to bring all its notes upon it at once for pay-
ment, the worst that can happen to the holders is, to be paid in
good bills of exchange at short dates, with the benefit of dis-
count; that is to say, to be paid with the same bills of ex-
change, whereon the bank has issued its notes. If the bank
have a capital of its own, there is so much additional security;
but, under a government subject to no control, or to nominal
control only, neither the capital of the bank, nor the assets in
its hands, offer any solid security whatever. The will of an
arbitrary prince is all the holders have to depend upon= and
every act of credit is an act of imprudence.
Forgery alone is enough to derange the affairs of the best
conducted and most solid bank. And forgery of notes is more
to be apprehended, than counterfeits of specie. The stimulus
of gain is greater. For there is more profit to be made by con-
verting a sheet of paper into money, than by giving the ap-
pearance of precious metal to another metal, that has some
though very little, intrinsic value, especially if it be com-
pounded or covered with a small portion of the counterfeited
metal; and perhaps, too, the materials for the former opera-
tion are less liable to discovery. Besides, the counterfeits of
specie can never reduce the value of the specie itself, be-
cause the latter has an intrinsic and independent value as a
commodity; whereas, the mere belief that there are forged
notes abroad, so well executed, as to be scarcely distinguish-
able from the genuine, is enough to bring both forged and
As far as I am capable of judging, such is the effect of banks
of circulation and of their paper issues upon individuals and
national wealth. This effect is described by Smith in a quaint
119Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
In the first place, a paper, wherewith debts can be legally,
though fraudulently, discharged, derives a kind of value from
that single circumstance. Moreover, the paper-money may
be made efficient to discharge the perpetually recurring claims
of public taxation. Sometimes a tariff or maximum of price is
established; which, indeed, soon extinguishes the production
of the commodities affected by it, but gives to the paper-money
a portion of the value of those actually in existence. Besides,
the very creation of a paper-money with forced circulation
occasions the disappearance of metallic money; for, as it is
made to pass at par with paper, it naturally seeks a market,
where it can find its true level of value. The paper-money is
thus left in the exclusive possession of the business of circu-
lation; and the absolute necessity of some agent of transfer,
in every civilized community, will then operate to maintain
its value. 304 So urgent is this necessity, that the paper-money
of England, consisting of the notes of the bank, has been kept
at par with specie, simply by the limitation of the issues to the
demands of circulation.
genuine into discredit. For which reason, banks have some-
times preferred the loss of paying notes they know to be forged,
to the hazard of bringing the genuine ones into discredit, by
the exposure of the fraud.
One method of checking the immoderate use of notes is, to
limit them to a fixed and high denomination of value; so as to
make them adapted to the circulation of goods from one mer-
chant to another, but inconvenient for the circulation between
the merchant and the consumer. It has been questioned whether
a government has any right to prohibit the issue of small notes,
where the public is willing to take them; and whether such
limitation be not a violation of that liberty of commerce, which
it is the chief duty of a government to protect. But the right
undoubtedly is just as complete, as that of ordering a build-
ing to be pulled down, because it endangers the public safety.

Section IV. Paper-Money.

Nations precipitated into foreign wars, before they have had
time previously to accumulate the requisite capital for carry-
ing them on, and destitute of sufficient credit to borrow of
their neighbours, have almost always had recourse to paper-
money, or some similar expedient. The Dutch, in their struggle
with the Spanish crown for independence, issued money of
paper, of leather, and of many other materials. The United
States of America, under similar circumstances, likewise had
recourse to paper-money; and the expedient that enabled the
French republic to foil the formidable attack of the first coa-
lition, has immortalized the name of assignats.

The distinctive appellation of paper-money, I have reserved
exclusively for those obligations, to which the ruling power
may give a compulsory circulation in payment for all pur-
chases, and discharge all debts and contracts, stipulating a
delivery of money. I call them obligations, because, though
the authority that issues, is not bound to redeem them, at least
not immediately, yet they commonly express a promise of
redemption at sight, which is absolutely nugatory; or of re-
demption at a date expressed, for which there is no sort of
security; or of territorial indemnity, the value of which we
shall presently inquire into.

Law has been unjustly charged with the whole blame of the
calamities resulting from the scheme that bears his name. That
he entertained just ideas respecting money, may be gathered
from the perusal of a tract 305 he published in his native coun-
try, Scotland. to induce the Scotch government to establish a
bank of circulation. The bank established in France, in 1716,
was founded on the principles there set forth. Its notes were
expressed in these words:

Such obligations, whether subscribed by the government or
by individuals, can be converted into paper-money by the
public authority only, which alone can authorise the owners
of money to pay in paper. The act is, indeed, an exertion, not
of legitimate, but of arbitrary authority; being a deterioration
of the national money in the extreme degree.
Upon the principles above established, it should seem, that a
money destitute of all value as a commodity, ought to pass
for none in all free dealing subsequent to its issue; and this is
always the case in practice sooner or later. The notes of what
was improperly called Law’s Bank, and the assignats issued
during the French revolution, were never regularly called in
or cancelled; yet those of the highest denomination would
not pass at present for a single sol. How then, came they ever
to pass for more than their real value? Because there are many
expedients of fraud and violence, which will always have a
temporary efficacy.

“The bank promises to pay the bearer at sight * * * * ** *
livres in money of the same weight and standard as the money
of this day. Value received at Paris,” &c.
The bank, which was then but a private association, paid its
notes regularly on demand= they were not yet metamorphosed
into paper money. Matters remained on this footing, and went
on very well, till the year 1719; 306 at which period the king, or
rather the regent, repaid the shareholders, and took the man-
agement into his own hands, calling it the Royal Bank. The
notes were then altered to this form:

“The bank promises to pay the bearer at sight * * * * * * *
livres in silver coin. Value received. at Paris,” &c.
What value did they convey the notion of? Was it the value of
the quantity of silver, heretofore known under the designation of one hundred francs? No; for 100 fr. could not possibly  be obtained with an assignat to that amount. Did it convey the idea of as much land, as might be purchased for 100 fr. in  silver? 

Certainly not; for that quantity of land could no more
be obtained, even from the government, by an assignat of 100 fr. than 100 fr. in specie. The domains were disposed of
at public auction for as many assignats as they would fetch;
and the value of this paper had latterly so far declined, that
one of 100 fr. would not buy an inch square of land.
This alteration, slight as it was in appearance, was a radical
one in substance. The first note stipulated to pay a fixed quan-
tity of silver, viz. the quantity contained in the livres current
at the date of issuing the notes. The second merely engaged
to pay livres, and so opened a door for whatever alterations
an arbitrary power might think proper to make in the real value expressed by the word livre. And this was called fixing
the rate of the paper-money; whereas, on the contrary, it was
unfixing, and making it a fluctuating value; and the fluctuations were truly deplorable. Law strenuously opposed the innovation; but principle was compelled to give way to power;
and the crimes of power, when the consequences began to be
felt, were confidently attributed to the fallacy of the principle.

In short, setting aside all consideration of the discredit at-
tached to that government, the sum expressed in an assignat
presented the idea of no definite value whatever; and those
securities could not but have fallen to nothing, even had the
government inspired all the confidence, of which it was so
eminently destitute. The error was discovered in the end, when
it was impossible any longer to purchase the most trifling
article with any sum of assignats, whatever might be its
amount. The next measure was to issue mandats, that is to
say, papers purporting to be an order for the absolute transfer
of the specific portion of the national domains expressed in
the mandats but, besides that it was then too late, the opera-
tion was infamously executed.

The assignats issued by the revolutionary government were
worth even less than the paper-money of the regency. The
latter gave a promise, at least, of paying in silver= and, though
the payment might be greatly curtailed by a deterioration of
the silver coin, yet sooner or later the paper might have been
redeemed, if the government had but been more moderate in
its issues, and more scrupulous in fulfilling its engagements.
But the assignats conveyed no right to call for silver; nothing
but a right to purchase or obtain the national domains. Let us
see what this right was really worth.
