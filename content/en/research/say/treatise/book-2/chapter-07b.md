## Section 2: The Profits of the Man of Science

I am speaking only of the revenue a man of science derives from his calling. There is nothing to prevent his being at the same time a landed proprietor, capitalist or adventurer and possessed of other revenue in these different capacities.

The philosopher, the man who makes it his study to direct the laws of nature to the greatest possible benefit of mankind,
receives a very small proportion of the products of that industry, which derives such prodigious advantage from the
knowledge, whereof he is at the same time the depository and the promoter. The cause of his disproportionate payment
seems to be, that, to speak technically, he throws into circulation, in a moment, an immense stock of his product, which is
one that suffers very little by wear; so that it is long before operative industry is obliged to resort to him for a fresh supply.


## Section 3: The Profits of the Master-agent, or Adventurer, in Industry.

We shall, in this section, consider only that portion of the profits of the master-agent, or adventurer, which may be considered as the recompense of that peculiar character. 

If a master-manufacturer have a share in the capital embarked in his concern, he must be ranked pro tanto in the class of capitalists, and the benefits thence derived be set down as part of the profits of the capital so embarked. 45

The scientific acquirements, without which abundance of manufacturing processes could never have been executed, are
probably the result of long study, intense reflection, and a
course of experiments equally ingenious and delicate, that
are the joint occupation of the highest degree of chemical,
medical, and mathematical skill But the knowledge, acquired
with so much difficulty, is probably transmissible in a few
pages; and, through the channel of public lectures, or of the
press, is circulated in much greater abundance, than is re-
quired for consumption; or, rather, it spreads of itself, and
being imperishable, there is never any necessity to recur to
those, from whom it originally emanated.

It very seldom happens, that the party engaged in the man-
agement of any undertaking, is not at the same time in the
receipt of interest upon some capital of his own. The man-
ager of a concern rarely borrows from strangers the whole of
the capital employed. If he have but purchased some of the
implements with his own capital, or made advances from his
own funds, he will then be entitled to one portion of his rev-
enue in quality of manager, and another in that of capitalist.
Mankind are so little inclined to sacrifice any particle of their
self-interest, that even those, who have never analyzed these
respective rights, know well enough how to enforce them to
their full extent in practice.

Thus, according to the natural laws, whereby the price of things is determined, this superior class of knowledge will be
very ill paid; that is to say, it will receive a very inadequate portion of the value of the product, to which it has contributed. It is from a sense of this injustice, that every nation, sufficiently enlightened to conceive the immense benefit of scientific pursuits, has endeavoured, by special favours and flattering distinctions, to indemnify the man of science, for the very trifling profit derivable from his professional occupations, and from the exertion of his natural or acquired faculties.

Our present concern is, to distinguish the portion of revenue, which the adventurer receives as adventurer. We shall see by
and-by, what he, or somebody else, derives in the character of capitalist.

It may be remembered, that the occupation of adventurer is comprised in the second class of operations specified as nec-
essary for the setting in motion of every class of industry whatever; that is to say, the application of acquired knowledge to the creation of a product for human consumption. 46 

It will likewise be recollected, that such application is equally
necessary in agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial in-
dustry; that the labour of the farmer or cultivator on his own
account, of the master-manufacturer and of the merchant, all
come under this description; they are the adventurers in each
department of industry respectively. The nature of the profits
of these three classes of men, is what we are now about to
consider.

Sometimes a manufacturer discovers a process, calculated
either to introduce a new product, to increase the beauty of
an old one, or to produce with greater economy; and, by ob-
servance of strict secrecy, may make for many years, for his
whole life perhaps, or even bequeath to his children, profits
exceeding the ordinary ratio of his calling. In this particular
case the manufacturer combines two different operations of
industry= that of the man of science, whose profit he engrosses
himself, and that of the adventurer too. But few such discov-
eries can long remain secret; which is a fortunate circum-
stance for the public, because this secrecy keeps the price of
the particular product it applies to above, and the number of
consumers enabled to enjoy it below, the natural level. 44
The price of their labour is regulated, like that of all other
objects, by the ratio of the supply, or quantity of that labour

thrown into circulation, to the demand or desire for it. There
are two principal causes operating to limit the supply, which,
consequently, maintain at a high rate the price of this supe-
rior kind of labour.

adventure is made, but likewise to have some notion of the
extent of demand, and of the markets whither it is consigned
for sale. For this purpose, the trader must be constantly in-
formed of the price-current of every commodity in different
parts of the world. To form a correct estimate of these prices,
he must be acquainted with the different national currencies,
and their relative value, or, as it is termed, the rate of exchange. He must know the means of transport, its risk and
expense, the custom and laws of the people he corresponds with; in addition to all which, he must possess sufficient knowledge of mankind to preserve him from the dangers of misplaced confidence in his agents, correspondents, and
connexions. If the science requisite to make a good farmer is more common than that which can make a good merchant, it
is not surprising, that the labour of the former is but poorly paid, in comparison with that of the latter.
It is commonly requisite for the adventurer himself to provide the necessary funds. Not that he must be already rich;
for he may work upon borrowed capital; but he must at least be solvent, and have the reputation of intelligence, prudence,
probity, and regularity; and must be able, by the nature of his connexions, to procure the loan of capital he may happen
himself not to possess. These requisites shut out a great many competitors.

In the second place, this kind of labour requires a combination of moral qualities, that are not often found together. Judg-
ment, perseverance, and a knowledge of the world, as well as of business. He is called upon to estimate, with tolerable ac-
curacy, the importance of the specific product, the probable amount of the demand, and the means of its production= at
one time he must employ a great of number of hands; at another, buy or order the raw material, collect labourers, find
consumers, and give at all times a rigid attention to order and economy; in a word, he must possess the art of superinten-
dence and administration. He must have a ready knack of calculation, to compare the charges of production with the
probable value of the product when completed and brought to market. In the course of such complex operations, there are abundance of obstacles to be surmounted, of anxieties to be repressed, of misfortunes to be repaired, and of expedients to be devised. Those who are not possessed of a combination of these necessary qualities, are unsuccessful in their
undertakings; their concerns soon fall to the ground, and their
labour is quickly withdrawn from the stock in circulation;
leaving such only, as is successfully, that is to say, skilfully
directed. Thus, the requisite capacity and talent limit the num-
ber of competitors for the business of adventurers. Nor is this
all= there is always a degree of risk attending such undertak-
ings; however well they may be conducted, there is a chance
of failure; the adventurer may, without any fault of his own,
sink his fortune, and, in some measure his character; which is
another check to the number of competitors, that also tends
to make their agency so much the dearer.

It is not meant by this to be understood, that commercial industry in every branch, requires a combination of rarer quali-
fications than agricultural. The retail dealers for the most part
pursue the routine of their business quite as mechanically as
the generality of farmers, and, in some kinds of cultivation,
very uncommon care and sagacity are requisite. It is for the
reader to make the application= the business of the teacher is,
firmly to establish general principles; whence it will be easy
to draw a multitude of inferences, varied and modified by
circumstances, which are themselves the consequences of
other principles laid down in other parts of the subject. 

Thus, in astronomy, when we are told, that all the planets describe
equal areas in the same space of time, there is an implied reservation of such derangements, as arise from the proximity of other planets, whose attractive powers depend on another law of natural philosophy; and this must be attended to
in the examination of the phenomena of each in particular. 

It is for him, who would apply general laws to particular and
isolated cases, to make allowance for the influence of each of
those laws or principles, whose existence is already
recognised.

In reviewing presently the profit of mere manual labour, we
shall see the peculiar advantage, which his character of mas-
ter gives to the adventurer over the labourer; but it may be
useful to observe by the way the other advantages within reach
of an intelligent superior. He is the link of communication, as
well between the various classes of producers, one with an-
other, as between the producer and the consumer. He directs
the business of production, and is the centre of many bear-
ings and relations; he profits by the knowledge and by the
ignorance of other people, and by every accidental advan-
tage of production.

All branches of industry do not require an equal degree of capacity and knowledge. A farmer who adventures in tillage, is not expected to have such extensive knowledge as a merchant, who adventures in trade with distant countries. The farmer may do well enough with a knowledge of the ordinary routine of two or three kinds of cultivation. But the science necessary for conducting a commerce with long returns is of a much higher order. It is necessary to be well versed, not only in the nature and quality of the merchandise in which the should do so, though at a greater charge, to avoid the higher
price of labour, that must eventually recoil on them. 

Thus, it is this class of producers, which accumulates the largest fortunes, whenever productive exertion is crowned by
unusual success.

Every particular line or profession does not, indeed, recruit its own numbers with children nursed among its own mem-
bers. The new generation is transferred from one class of life to another, and particularly from rural occupations to occu-
pations of a similar cast in the towns; for this reason, that children are cheaper trained in the country= all I mean to say
is, that the rudest and lowest class of labour necessarily derives from its product a portion sufficient, not merely for its
present maintenance, but likewise for the recruiting of its numerical strength. 49
