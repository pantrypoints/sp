We have now sufficiently considered the nature and motive
of the interest paid by the borrower to the lender of capital,
and, though it appears pretty plainly, that this interest is com-
pounded of the rent of the capital, and of the premium of
insurance against the risk of its partial or total loss, we have
also seen enough, to comprehend the extreme difficulty of
severing and distinguishing these two ingredients.

What are the causes of the profit derivable from the employment of capital? , whether

and the inconvenience of a long, perhaps a two years’ dura-
tion of one single operation before the returns come to hand,
a proportion of the capital is gradually withdrawn from that
channel; the competition slackens, and the profits advance,
until they rise high enough to attract fresh capital. 72

by a borrower or by the proprietor himself= to which end it
will be necessary, in the outset, to sever it from the profit of
the industry, that turns it to account; and here again we shall meet with the greatest difficulty, in drawing the line of dis-
tinction; though it is easy to perceive, that these two classes
of profit, generally speaking, are combined in the recompense
or portion of the adventurer. Smith, and most of the English
writers on this science, have omitted to notice this distinction; they comprise under the general head of the profit of
capital, or stock, as they term it, many items, which evidently
belong to the head of the profit of industry. 70

This also explains why the profits, derivable from a new mode of employment, are larger than those of common
and ordinary employments, where the production and consumption have been well understood for years. In the former
case, competition is deterred by the uncertainty of success; in
the latter, allured by the security of the employment.

Perhaps an approximation may be made to the accurate appreciation of that part of the aggregate profit, which apper-
tains to the capital, and that, which appertains to the industry
employing it, respectively, by comparing the mean ratio of
total profit with the mean ratio of the difference of profit in
the same line of business, which seems a fair index of the
difference of the skill and labour engaged. We will suppose
two houses, in the fur trade for example, to work each upon a
capital of 100,000 dollars, and to make on the average, an
annual profit, the one of 24,000 dollars, the other of 6000
dollars only; a difference of 18,000 dollars fairly referable to
the different degree of skill and labour, the mean of which is
9000 dollars; this may be considered as the gains of industry,
which, deducted from 15,000 dollars, the mean profit of the
trade, will leave 6000 dollars for the profit of the capital
embarked in it.

In short, in this matter, as in all others, where the interests of
mankind clash one with another, the ratio is determined by
the relative demand and supply for each mode of employ-
ment of capital respectively.

Adam Smith's maxim was that human labour was the first price. It was the original purchase-money paid for all things. 

He forgot to add, that for every object of purchase, there is paid, the agency and co-operation of the capital employed in its production. 

Is not capital itself, they will say, composed of accumulated prod-
ucts,-of accumulated labour? 

Granted but the value of capital, like that of land, is distinguishable from the value of its
productive agency; the value of a field is quite different from
that of its annual rent. When a capital of 1000 dollars is lent,
or rather lent on hire, for a year, in consideration of 50 dol-
lars more or less, its agency is transferred for that space of
time, and for that consideration; besides the 50 dollars, the
lender receives hack the whole principal sum of 1000 dollars, which is applicable to the same objects as before. 

Thus, although the capital be itself a pre-existent product, the annual profit upon it is an entirely new one, and has no refer-
ence to the industry, wherein the capital originated.

This example I could suggest as a means, rather of distinguishing those items of profit thus mixed up together, than of
estimating their respective ratio with any tolerable certainty.

But, without any index to the precise line of demarkation between the profits of capital and those of the industry em-
ploying it, we may take it for granted, that the former will always be proportionate to the risk of partial or total loss, and
to the duration of the employment. 

In practice, adventurers, having capital at their command, always weigh beforehand the advantages and disadvantages of the different modes of
investment, as specified above, 71 and naturally prefer, ceteris paribus, those presenting the smallest risk and the quickest
return; so that there is less competition of capital for hazard-
ous and longwinded adventurers; indeed, none whatever is
embarked in them, unless they hold out a rate of profit so
much above the average rate, as to tempt the capitalist to run
the risk. 

Theory, therefore, leads to the presumption, which is confirmed by the test of experience, that the profit of capital
is high, in proportion to the hazard of the adventure, and to
the length of its duration.

Wherefore when a product is ultimately completed by the aid
of capital, one portion of its value must go to recompense the
agency of the capital, as well as another to reward that of the
industry, that have concurred in its production. 

The portion so applied is wholly distinct from the value of the capital
itself, which is returned to the full amount, and emerges in a
perfect state from its productive employment. Nor does this
profit upon capital represent any part of the industry engaged
in its original formation.

From all which it is impossible to avoid drawing this conclusion, that the profit of capital, like that of land and the other
natural sources, is the equivalent given for a productive ser-
vice, which though distinct from that of human industry, is
nevertheless its efficient ally in the production of wealth.
When a particular employment of capital, the trade with China,
for instance, does not afford a profit proportionate, not only
to the time of the detention, but likewise to the danger of loss,

The employment of capital, that tends least to the national advantage, is the carrying trade between one foreign country
and another.
