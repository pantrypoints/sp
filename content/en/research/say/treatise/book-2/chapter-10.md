One nation cannot take from another the revenues of its industry. 

A German tailor, establishing himself in France, there makes a profit, in which Germany had no participation. But, if this tailor contrive to amass a little capital, and after the lapse of several years carry it back with him to his native country, he injures France to the same extent as a French capitalist, who should emigrate with the same amount of fortune. 82

In a political view, the injury to the wealth of the nation is equal in both cases; but in a moral light, it is otherwise; for I reckon that a native Frenchman in quitting his country, robs it of an affectionate attachment, and a spirit of exclusive nationality, which it can never look for in a stranger born.

Leases are nowhere more sacredly regarded than in England; and the privilege, enjoyed by leasees to the amount of 40s. (about 10 dollars) and upwards, of voting at Parliamentary elections, has. in some measure, restored the equipoise of power and influence between landlords and tenants, which seldom exists in practice. In no other country do we see ten

however, acquires a fixed and permanent property, in lieu of  one more perishable, transferable, and destructible. Mismanagement may soon annihilate the capital the nation has acquired; but the land remains a permanent possession of the purchaser, and he may sell it and get back the value when he pleases. 

There is therefore nothing to be apprehended from the purchase of land by foreigners, provided there be wisdom
enough, to employ in reproduction the value received in exchange.

A nation, receiving a stray child into its bosom again, acquires a real treasure; inasmuch as in him it receives an addi-
tion to its population, an accession to the profits of national industry, and an acquisition of capital. It at the same time
recovers a lost citizen, and the means for him to subsist upon.

If the exile bring back his industry only, at any rate the profits of industry are added to the national stock. It is true, that a source of consumption is likewise superadded; but supposing it to counterbalance the advantage, there is no diminution
of revenue, while the moral and political strength of the country is actually augmented. 83
The particular form, in which one nation may draw revenue from another, is of no importance whatever. It may be remit-
ted in specie, in bullion, or in any other kind of merchandise:

indeed it is of the greatest consequence to leave individuals to take it in the shape that best suits their convenience; for
what suits them will infallibly be the best for both nations; in like manner as in the conduct of international trade, the com-
modity, which individuals export or import in preference, is that which best suits the mutual national interests. 

The agents of the English East India Company drew from that, country, either an annual revenue, or an accumulated fortune, which they returned to England to enjoy and live upon= they took good care not to withdraw these remittances in the shape of gold or silver, because the precious metals were of more relative value in Asia than in Europe; they remitted in the shape of India goods and products, on which a fresh profit was made on arrival in Europe= every million they remitted, swelled, perhaps, to so much as 1,200,000, by the time it reached the place of destination. Thus, Europe gained to the amount of 1,200,000, while India lost only a million. If these despoilers of India 85 insisted on transmitting this whole sum in specie, they must have robbed Hindostan, perhaps, of 1,500,000, or upwards, for every 1,200,000 that England received. 

The same sum may, perhaps, have been amassed originally in specie; but it was always remitted in the shape of that commodity, which, for the time being, answered best as an object of transport. 

As long as exportation of any kind is allowed, and exportation has always been regarded by statesmen with a favourable eye, it is easy to receive in one country, the revenue and capital derived from another And the remittance cannot be prevented by the government, without the interdiction of all external commerce, which, after all, would leave the resource of smuggling and contraband. In the eyes of political economy, nothing is more absurd, than to see governments prohibit the export of the national specie, as a means of checking the emigration of wealth. 86

With regard to the capital lent by one nation to another, the effect upon their respective wealth is precisely analogous to
that, resulting from every loan from one individual to another.

If France borrow capital from Holland, and devote it to a productive purpose, she will gain the profit of industry and land accruing from the employment of that capital; and she will do so even though she pay interest; in like manner as a
merchant or manufacturer borrows for the purposes of his
concern, and gains a residue of profit, even after paying the
interest of the loan.

But, if one state borrow from another, not for productive purposes, but for those of mere expenditure, the capital borrowed
will then yield no return, and the national revenue be saddled with the interest to the foreign creditor. Such was the condition of France, when she borrowed from the Genoese, the Dutch, and the Genevese, for the support of her wars, or to feed the prodigality of a court. Yet it was better to borrow from strangers than from natives, even for the purpose of dissipation; because, the amount so borrowed was not withdrawn
from the national productive capital of France. 

In either case, the French people would have to pay the interest; 84 but had they likewise lent the capital, they would have had to pay the
interest, and at the same time have lost the benefit, which their industry and land might have derived from its employment and agency.

With regard to such landed property, as may belong to foreigners residing abroad, the revenue arising from it is an item
of foreign, and forms no part of the national revenue. But it is to be remembered, that the foreigner cannot have purchased it without a remittance of capital equal in value to the land; which capital is an equally valuable acquisition, particularly
if the nation be possessed of improveable land in abundance, but of little capital to set industry in motion. 

In making his purchase of land, the foreigner exchanges a revenue of capttal, which he leaves the nation to profit by, for a revenue of land; which he thenceforth receives= thus bartering interest of money for rent of land. If the national industry be active and
skilfully directed, more benefit may be derived from the interest, than was before obtained from the rent; the purchaser,
