Trade and barter adapt the products to the general nature of the demand. 

The objects most in demand are food and habitation. The wants of each family or individual, are more or less fully satisfied, in proportion to the ability to purchase these objects.  which ability depends upon the productive means and exertion of each respectively; in plain terms, upon the revenue of each respectively. 

Thus, in the end, if we sift this matter to the bottom, we shall find, that families, and nations, which are but aggregations of families, subsist wholly on their own products; and that the amount of product in each case necessarily limits the numbers of those who can subsist upon it.


## Section 1: Population, as connected with Political Economy

Book 1 investigated the production of the articles necessary to the satisfaction of human wants. Book 3 traced their distribution among the different members of the community, let us now further extend our observations
to the influence those products exercise upon the number of individuals, of which the community is composed; that is to
say, upon population. 

In her treatment of all organic bodies, nature seems to neglect the individual, and afford protection
only to the species. 

Natural history presents very curious examples of her extraordinary care to perpetuate the species;
but the most powerful means she adopts for that purpose, is the multiplication of germs in such vast profusion, that not-
withstanding the immense variety of accidents occurring to prevent their early development, or destroy them in the
progress too maturity, there are always left more than sufficient to perpetuate the species. Did not accident, destruction,
or failure of the means of development, check the multiplication of organic existence, there is no animal or plant that might
not cover the face of the globe in a very few years.

Such animals as are incapable of providing for future exigencies, after they are engendered, if they do not fall a prey to
man, or some of their fellow brutes, perish the moment they experience an imperative want, which they have not the means
of gratifying. But man has so many future wants to provide for, that he could not answer the end of his creation, without
a certain degree of providence and forethought; and this provident turn can alone preserve the human species from part of
the evils it would necessarily endure, if its numbers were to be perpetually reduced by the process of destructive violence. 88

Yet notwithstanding the forethought ascribed to man, and the restraints imposed on him by reason, legislation, and social
habits, the increase of population is always evidently co-extensive, and even something more than co-extensive, with the
means of subsistence. It is a melancholy but an undoubted fact, that, even in the most thriving countries, part of the population annually dies of mere want. 

Not that all who perish from want absolutely die of hunger; though this calamity is
of more frequent occurrence than is generally supposed. 89 I
mean only that they have not at command all the necessaries
of life, and die for want of some part of those articles of necessity. 

A sick or disabled person may, perhaps, require nothing more than a little rest, or medical advice, together with,
perhaps, some simple remedy, to set him up again; but the requisite rest, or advice, or remedy, is denied, or not afforded.
A child may require the attentions of the mother, but the mother may perhaps be taken away to labour, by the imperious calls
of necessity; and the child perish through accident, neglect, or disease. It is a fact well established by the researches of all who have turned their attention to statistics, that out of an equal number of children of wealthy and of indigent parents,
at least twice as many of the latter die in infancy as of the former. 

In short, scanty or unwholesome diet, the insufficient change of linen, the want of warm and dry clothing, or of fuel, ruin the health, undermine the constitution, and sooner or later bring multitudes of human beings to an untimely end;
This faculty of infinite increase is common to man, with all other organic bodies; and although his superior intelligence
continually enlarges his own means of existence, he must sooner or later arrive at the ultimum.

Animal existence depends upon the gratification of one sole and immediate want, that of food and sustenance; but man is
enabled, by the faculty of communication with his species, to barter one product for another, and to regard the value, rather
than the nature, of the product. The producer and owner of a piece of furniture of twenty dollars value, may consider him-
self as possessing as much human food, as may be procurable for that price. And with respect to the relative price of
products, it is in all cases determined by the intensity of the desire, the degree of utility in each product for the time be-
ing. We may safely take it for granted, that mankind in general will not barter an object of more, for one of less urgent
necessity In a season of agricultural scarcity, a larger quantity of furniture will be given for a smaller quantity of human
aliment; but it is invariably true, that whenever barter takes place, the object given on one side is worth that given on the
other, and that the one is procurable for the other. 87


and all, that perish in consequence of want beyond their means
to supply, may be said to die of want. ishing. In the United States of America, population has been
doubling in the course of twenty years.

Thus, to man, particularly in a forward state of civilization, a variety of products, some of them in the class of what have been denominated immaterial products, are necessaries of existence; these are multiplied in a degree proportionate to the desire for them, respectively, because its intensity causes a proportionate elevation of their price= and it may be laid down as a general maxim, that the population of a state is always proportionate to the sum of its production in every kind. 90 This is a truth acknowledged by most writers on political economy, however various and discordant their opinions on most other points. 91 For the same reasons, although temporary calamities may
sweep off multitudes, yet, if they leave untainted the source of reproduction, they are sure to prove more afflicting to humanity, than fatal to population. It soon trenches again upon the limit, assigned by the aggregate of annual production.

Messance has given some very curious calculations, whereby it appears, that after the ravages occasioned by the famous plague of Marseilles in 1720, marriages throughout Provence were more fruitful than before. 

The Abbe d’Expilly comes to the same conclusion. 

The same effect was observable in Prussia, after the plague of 1710. Although it had swept off a third of the population, the tables of Sussmilch 94 show the number of births, which, before the plague, amounted annually to about 26,000, to have advanced in the year following, 1711, to no less than 32,000, It might have been supposed, that the number of marriages, after so terrible a mortality, would have been at least considerably reduced, on the contrary, it actually doubled; a strong indication of the tendency
of population to keep always on a level with the national resources.

A very natural consequence of this maxim, has escaped their observation;
which is, that nothing can permanently increase population,
except the encouragement and advance of production; and
that nothing can occasion its permanent diminution, but such circumstances as attack production in its sources.

The Romans were forever making regulations to repair the loss of population, occasioned by their state of perpetual external warfare. Their censors preached up matrimony; their laws offered premiums and honours to plurality of children;
but these measures were fruitless. There is no difficulty in getting children; the difficulty lies in maintaining them. They should have enlarged their internal production, instead of spreading devastation amongst their neighbours. All their boasted regulations did not prevent the effectual depopulation of Italy and Greece, even long before the inroads of the
barbarous northern hordes. 92

The loss of population is not the greatest calamity resulting from such temporary visitations; the first and greatest is, the
misery they occasion to the human race. Great multitudes can not be swept from the land of the living by pestilence, famine
or war, without the endurance of a vast deal of suffering and agony, by numbers of sentient beings; besides the pain, dis-
tress, and misery of the survivors; the destitution of widows, orphans, brothers, sisters, and parents. It is a subject of additional regret, if among the rest, there happen to fall one or two of those superior and enlightened men, whose single tal-
ents and virtues have more effect upon the happiness and wealth of nations, than the grovelling industry of a million of
ordinary mortals.

The edict of Louis XVI in favour of marriage, awarding pensions to those parents who should have ten, and larger ones
to those who should have twelve children, was attended with no better success. The premiums that monarch held out in a
thousand ways to indolence and uselessness, were much more adverse, than such poor encouragements could be conducive, to the increase of population.

Moreover, a great loss of human beings, arrived at maturity, is certainly a loss of so much acquired wealth or capital; for
every grown person is an accumulated capital, representing all the advances expended during a course of many years, in
training and making him what he is. A bantling a day old by no means replaces a man of twenty; and the well-known expression of the Prince de Condé, on the victorious field of Senef, was equally absurd and unfeeling. 95

The discovery of the new world is said to have depopulated old Spain. In reality, her depopulation was caused by:
- the vicious institutions of her government, and
- the small amount of her internal product, in proportion to her territorial extent. 93 

The most effective encouragement to population size is:
- the activity of industry, and
- the consequent multiplication of the national products. 

It abounds in all industrious districts, and, when a virgin soil happens to co-operate with the exertions of a community, whence idleness is altogether discarded, its rapid increase is truly astonThe destructive scourges of the human species, therefore, if not injurious to population, are at least an outrage on humanity; on which account alone, their authors are highly criminal. 96

But though such temporary calamities are more afflicting to humanity than hurtful to the population of nations, far other
is the effect of a vicious government, acting upon a bad system of political economy. This latter attacks the very principle of population, by drying up the sources of production;

Since the numbers of mankind, as before seen, always approach nearly to the utmost limits the annual revenue of
the nation will admit of, if the government reduce that revenue by the pressure of intolerable taxation, forcing the sub-
ject to sacrifice part of his capital.

Consequently diminishing the aggregate means of subsistence and reproduction possessed by the community, such a government not only
imposes a preventive check on further procreation, but may be fairly said to commit downright murder; for nothing so
effectually thins the effective ranks of mankind, as privation of the means of subsistence.

saries, and some of the superfluities of life amongst all classes
of the population. Some parts of India and of China are oppressed with population, and with misery also; but their con-
dition would be nowise improved by thinning its numbers, at least if it were brought about by a diminution of the aggre-
gate product. Instead of reducing the numbers of the population, it were far more desirable to augment the gross product;
which may always be effected by superior individual activity, industry, and frugality, and the better administration, that is
to say, the less frequent interference of public authority.

But it will naturally be asked, if the population of a country regularly keeps pace with its means of subsistence, what will
become of it in years of scarcity and famine?

Hear what Stewart 99 says on the subject= “There is a very great deception as to the difference between crops; a good year for
one soil is bad for another.” “It is far from being true,” he continues, “that the same number of people consume always
the same quantity of food. 

In years of plenty, every one is well fed; — food is not so frugally managed; a quantity of animals are fatted for use; — and people drink more largely, because all is cheap. A year of scarcity comes; the people are
ill fed; 

When the lower classes come to divide with their children, the portions are brought to be very small;” instead
of saving, they consume their previous hoard; 

After all, it is unhappily too true, that part of that class must suffer and perish.

The evil effects of monastic establishments upon population, have been severely and justly inveighed against; but the mode,
in which they operate, has been misunderstood; it is the idleness, not the celibacy, of the monastic orders, that ought to be
censured. 

They put their lands into cultivation, it is true, but where is the merit of that? Would the lands remain untilled, if
the monastic system were abolished? 

So far from that evil resulting from the abolition, wherever these establishments
have been converted into manufactories, of which the French
revolution has offered many examples, equal agricultural produce has continued to be raised, and the produce of the manu-
facturing industry has been all clear gain; while the increased
total product, thus created, has been followed by an increase
of population also.

This calamity is most common in countries overflowing with population, like Hindostan, or China, where there is little
external or maritime commerce, and where the poorer classes have always been strictly limited to the mere necessaries of
life. There, the produce of ordinary years is barely sufficient to allow this miserable pittance; consequently, the slightest
failure of the crop leaves multitudes wholly destitute of common necessaries, to rot and perish by wholesale. 

All accounts agree in representing that famines are, for this reason, very
frequent and destructive in China and many parts of
Hindostan.

From these premises, may likewise be drawn this further con-
clusion; that the inhabitants of a country are not more scant-
ily supplied with the necessaries of life, because their num-
ber is on the increase; nor more plentifully, because it is on
the decline. Their relative condition depends on the relative
quantity of products they have at their disposal; and it is easy
to conceive these products to be considerable, though the
population be dense; and scanty, though the population be
thinly spread. Famine was of more frequent occurrence in
Europe during the middle ages, than it has been of late years,
although Europe is evidently more thickly peopled at present.
The product of England, during the reign of queen Elizabeth,
was not nearly so abundant as it is now, although her popula-
tion was then less by half; and the population of Spain, re-
duced to but eight millions, enjoys not nearly so much afflu-
ence, as when it amounted to twenty-four. 97
Commerce in general, and maritime commerce in particular
facilitates the interchange of products, even with the most
remote countries, and thus renders it practicable to import
articles of subsistence, in return for several other kinds of
produce; but too great a dependence on this resource, leaves
the nation at the mercy of every natural or political occur-
rence, which may happen to intercept or derange the inter-
course with foreign countries. The intercourse must then be
preserved at all events, no matter whether by force or fraud,
competition must be got rid of by every means, however un-
justifiable; a separate province, or weak ally, perhaps, is
obliged to purchase the national products, under restrictions
Some writers 98 have considered a dense population as an in-
dex of national prosperity; and, doubtless, it is a certain sign
of enlarged national production. But general prosperity im-
plies the general diffusion and abundance of all the neces-

tion= 103 2. The indolence of the cultivators, and the too gen-
eral neglect of weeding, trimming the hedges, clearing the
trees of moss, destroying insects, &c. &c. 3. The neglect of a

ods of cultivation.

equally galling, as the exaction of actual tribute; and a com-
mercial monopoly enforced, even at the hazard of a war; all
which evils make the state of the nation extremely precarious
indeed.

The produce of England, in articles of human subsistence.
had undoubtedly increased largely towards the end of the 18th
century; but its produce in articles of apparel and household
furniture had probably increased still more rapidly. The con-
sequence has been, that immensity of production, which en-
ables her to multiply her population beyond what the pro-
duce of her soil can support, 100 and to bear up under the pres-
sure of public burthens, to which there is no parallel nor even
approximation. But England has suffered severely, whenever
foreign markets have been shut against her produce; and she
has sometimes been obliged to resort to violent means to pre-
serve her external intercourse. She would act wisely, perhaps,
in discontinuing those encouragements, that impel fresh capital
into the channels of manufacture and external commerce, and
directing it rather towards that of agricultural industry. It is
probable, that in that case, several districts, which have not
yet received the utmost cultivation of which they are suscep-
tible, particularly many parts of Scotland and Ireland, would
raise agricultural produce enough to purchase most part, if
not the whole, of the surplus product of her manufactures and
commerce beyond her present consumption. 101 Great Britain
would thereby create for herself a domestic consumption,
which is always the surest and the nost advantageous. Her
neighbours, no longer offended by the necessarily jealous and
exclusive nature of her policy, would probably lay aside their
hostile feelings, and become willing customers. But, after all,
if her, manufactured should still be disproportioned to her
agricultural produce, what is there to prevent her from adopt-
ing a system of judicious colonization, and thus creating for
herself fresh markets for the produce of her domestic indus-
try in every part of the globe, whence she might derive, in
return, a supply of food fol her superfluous population? 102
In the second place, the consumption is unthrifty and unprof-
itable; for a great part of it is mere waste, and yields no hu-
man gratification whatever. To speak of one article alone,
that is, of firing, which is an object of great value in districts,
where coal and wood are scarce; the waste of it is enormous
in the huts of the peasantry lighted as they often are by the
door-way only, and admitting the rain down the chimney while
the fire is burning. Unwholesome beverage or food, and the
indulgence of the alehouse, are like injurious modes of con-
sumption.

In fine, towns and villages would be more thickly spread, and
would besides present an appearance of greater affluence,
were the generality of the inhabitants more active and indus-
trious, and actuated by the laudable emulation, tinctured per-
haps with some little vanity, rather of possessing every object
of real utility, and exhibiting in their domestic arrangements
the utmost order and neatness, than of living in indolence
upon the rent of a trifling patrimony, or the scanty salary of
some useless public employ. The small proprietor, with an
income of 3 or 400 dollars per annum, just sufficient to veg-
etate upon, might double or triple it perhaps by adding the
revenue derivable from personal industry; and even those
engaged in useful occupations do not push them to the full
extent of their activity and intelligence. Moreover, the spirit
of inquiry and improvement has probably been disheartened
by the example of frequent ill success; although the failure
has commonly been occasioned by the want of judgment,
perseverance, and frugality.
National population is uniformly proportionate to the quan-
tum of national production; but it may vary locally within the
limits of each state, according to the favourable or
unfavourable operation of local circumstances. A particular
district will be rich, because Its soil is fertile, its inhabitants
industrious, and possessed of capital accumulated by their
frugality; in like manner as a family will surpass its neighbours
in wealth, because of its superior intelligence and activity.
The boundaries and political constitutions of states affect
population only, inasmuch as they affect the national produc-
tion. The influence of religion and national habits upon popu-
lation is precisely analogous. All travellers agree, that prot-
estant are both richer and more populous than catholic coun-
tries; and the reason is, because the habits of the former are
more conducive to production.
In this particular, the position of France appears to be pre-
cisely opposite to that of Great Britain. It would seem, that
her agricultural product is equal to the maintenance of a much
larger manufacturing and commercial population. The face
of the country presents the picture of high and general culti-
vation; but the villages and country towns are, for the most
part, surprisingly small, poor, ill-built, and ill-paved, the few
shops scantily supplied, and the public houses neither neat
nor comfortable. It is plain, the agricultural product must ei-
ther be less than the appearance would indicate, or it must be
consumed in a thriftless and unprofitable manner; probably
both these causes are in operation.
In the first place, the production is far less than it might be;
and that is chiefly owing to three causes= — 1. The want of
sufficient to afford subsistence to one of the suburbs of their
capital.
