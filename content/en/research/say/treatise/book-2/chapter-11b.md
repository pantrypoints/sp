## Section II. The influence of the Quality of a national product upon the local distribution of the Population

The cultivation of pasture land, requires much less human labour than that of arable. 

It follows, that, in grazing countries, a greater proportion of the inhabitants can apply
themselves to the arts of industry; which are therefore more
attended to in pasture than in corn countries. Witness Flanders,
Holland, and Normandy that was. 105

For the earth to be cultivated, it is necessary that population should be spread over its surface; for industry and commerce
to flourish, it is desirable to collect together in those spots, where the arts may be exercised with the most advantage;
that is to say, where there can be the greatest subdivision of labour. The dyer naturally establishes himself near the clothier; the druggist near the dyer; the agent, or owner, of a vessel
employed in the transport of drugs will approximate in locality to the druggist; and so of other producers in general.
From the period of the irruption of the barbarians into the
Roman empire, down to the 17th century, that is to say, to a
date almost within living memory, the towns made but little
figure in the larger states of Europe. That portion of the popu-
lation, which was thought to live upon the cultivators of the
land, was not then, as now, composed principally of merchants
and manufacturers, but consisted of a nobility, surrounded by
numerous retainers, of churchmen and other idlers, the ten-
ants of the chateau, the abbey, or the convent, with their sev-
eral dependencies; very few of them living within the towns.

The products of manufacture and commerce were very limited indeed; the manufacturers were the poor cottagers, and the merchants mere pedlars; a few rude implements of husbandry, and some very clumsy utensils and articles of furniture, answered all the purposes of cultivation and ordinary
life. 

The fairs, held three or four times in the year, furnished commodities of a superior quality, which we should now look
upon with contempt; and what rare household articles, stuffs, or jewels, of price, were from time to time imported from the
commercial cities of Italy, or from the Greeks of Constantinople, were regarded as objects of uncommon luxury and magnificence, far too costly for any but the richest princes and nobles.

At the same time, all such as live without labour on the interest of capital, or the rent of landed property, are attracted to
the towns, where they find brought to a focus, every luxury to feed their appetites, as well as a choice of society, and a variety of pleasure and amusement. The charms of a town life attract foreign visitors, and all such as live by their labour, but are free to exercise it wherever they like. 

Thus, towns become the abode of literary men and artizans, and likewise the seats of government, of courts of justice, and most other public establishments; and their population is enlarged by the addition of all the persons attached to such establishments, and all who are accidentally brought thither by business. 

Not but what there is always a number of country residents, that are employed in manufacturing industry, exclusive of such
as make it their abode in preference. Local convenience, running water, the contiguity of a forest or a mine, will draw a good deal of machinery, and a number of labourers, in manufacture, out of the precincts of towns. There are, likewise,
some kinds of work. which must be performed in the neighbourhood of the consumers, that of the tailor, the shoe-
maker, or the farrier; but these are trifling compared with the
manufacturing industry of all kinds executed in towns.

In this state of things, the towns of course made but a poor figure. Whatever magnificence they may possess in our time is of very modern date. In all the towns of France together, it would be impossible to point out a single handsome range of buildings, or fine street, of two hundred years’ antiquity. 

There is nothing of anterior date, with the exception of a few Gothic churches, but clumsy tenements huddled together in dirty and crooked streets, utterly impassable to the swarm of carriages,
cattle, and foot-passengers, that indicates the present popula-
tion and opulence.
Writers on political economy have calculated, that a thriving
country is capable of supporting in its towns, a population equal to that of the country. Some examples lead to an opinion, that it could support a still greater proportion, were its industry directed with greater skill and its agriculture conducted with more intelligence and less waste, even supposing its soil to be of very moderate fertility. 104 Thus much at
least is certain, that, when the towns raise a product for foreign consumption, they are then enabled to draw from abroad
provisions in return, and may sustain a population much larger in proportion to that of the country. Of this we have instances
in the numerous petty states, whose territory alone is barely No country can yield the utmost agricultural produce it is
equal to, until every part of its surface be studded with towns and cities. Few manufactures could arrive at perfection, with-
out the conveniences they afford; and, without manufactures, what is there to give in exchange for agricultural products? A
district whose agricultural products can find no market, feeds not half the number of inhabitants it is capable of supporting;
and the condition, even of those it does support, is rude

The local position of Washington, it should seem, is adverse
to its progress in size and opulence= for it has been outstripped
by most of the other cities of the Union; 107 whereas, Palmyra,
in ancient times, grew both wealthy and populous, though in
the midst of a sandy desert, solely because it had become the
entrepot of commerce between Europe and eastern Asia. The
same advantage gave importance and splendour to Alexandria, and, at a still more remote period, to Egyptian Thebes.

The mere will of a despot could never have made it a city of
a hundred gates, and of the magnitude and populousness recorded by Herodotus. Its grandeur must have been owing to
its vicinity to the Red Sea and the channel of the Nile, and to
its central position between India and Europe. 108

enough, and destitute both of comfort and refinement; they are in the lowest stage of civilization. But, if an industrious colony comes to establish itself in the district, and gradually forms a town, whose inhabitants increase till they equal the numbers of the original cultivators, the town will find subsistence on the agricultural product of the district, and the cultivators be enriched by the product of the industry of the town.

Moreover, towns offer indirect channels for the export of the
agricultural values of the district to a distant market. 

The raw products of agriculture are not easy of transport, because the expense soon swallows up the total price of the commodity transported. Manufactured produce has greatly the advantage in this respect; for industry will frequently attach very considerable value to a substance of little bulk and weight. 

By the means of manufacture, the raw products of national agriculture are converted into manufactured goods of much more condensed value, which will defray the charge of a more distant transport, and bring a return of produce adapted to the
wants of the exporting country.

If a city cannot be raised, neither does it seem, that its further aggrandizement can be arrested by the mere fiat of the mon-
arch. Paris continued to increase, in defiance of abundance of regulations issued by the government of the day to limit its
extension. The only effectual barrier is that opposed by natural causes, which it would be very difficult to define with precision, for it consists rather of an aggregate of little inconveniences, than of any grand or positive obstruction. In overgrown cities, the municipal administration is never well attended to; a vast deal of valuable time is lost in going from one quarter to another= the crossing and jostling is immense in the central parts= and the narrow streets and passages, having been calculated for a much smaller population, are unequal to the vast increase of horses, carriages, passengers, and traffic of all sorts. This evil is felt most seriously at Paris,
and accidents are growing more frequent every day; yet new streets are now building on the same defective plan, with a certain prospect of a like inconvenience in a very few years hence.

There are many of the provinces of France, that are miserable enough at present, yet want nothing but towns to bring
them into high cultivation. Their situation would, indeed, be hopeless, were we to adopt the system of that class of economists, which recommends the purchase of manufactures from foreign’ countries, with the raw produce of domestic agriculture. 106

However, if towns owe their origin and increase to the concentration of a variety of manufactures, great and small, manu-
factures, again, are to be set in activity by nothing but productive capital;

Productive capital is only to be accumulated by frugality of consumption. Wherefore, it is not enough to trace the plan of a town, and give it a name; before it can have real existence, it must be gradually supplied with industrious hands, mechanical skill, implements of trade, raw materials and the necessary subsistence of those engaged in industry, until the completion and sale of their products. 

Otherwise, instead of founding a city, a mere scaffolding is run up, which must soon fall to the ground, because it rests upon no solid foundation. This was the case with regard to Ecatherinos law, in the Crimea; and was, indeed, foreseen by the emperor Joseph II, who assisted at the ceremony of its foundation, and laid the second stone in due form:

“The empress of Russia and myself,” said he to his suite, “have completed a great work in a single day= she has laid the first stone of a city, and I have laid the finishing one.”
