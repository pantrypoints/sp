## Section 3: Taxation in Kind

Taxation in kind is the specific and immediate appropriation of a portion of the gross product to the public service.

It has this advantage, of calling on the producer only for what he has actually in hand, in the identical shape which it happens to be under. Belgium, after its conquest by France, found itself at times unable to pay its taxes, in spite of abundant crops; the war, and the prohibition of exportation, obstructed the sale of its produce, which the government enforced by demanding payment in money; whereas, the taxes might have been collected without difficulty, had the government been content to take payment in kind.

Besides, when money-prices grow high, and specie is consequently reduced in relative value, it gradually takes its departure, and becomes scarcer, like all other commodities= and thus a country, burthened with a taxation too heavy for its productive powers, is first drained of its commodities, and next of its specie; till it gradually reaches the extreme of penury and depopulation.

It has the further advantage of making it equally the interest of government and of the farmer to obtain plentiful crops, and improve the national agriculture. The levying of taxes in kind in China, was probably the origin of the peculiar encouragement, bestowed by its government upon the agricultural branch of production. 

But, why favour one branch, when all are equally entitled to protection, because all contribute to bear the public burthens? And, why has not government an equal interest in supporting the other branches, which it takes the trouble of extinguishing?

The marechal de Vauban, in his work entitled, Dixime Royale, a book replete with just views, and well worth the study of those who manage national finances, proposes a tax of 1-20 of the product of the land, which, in times of great emergency, might be raised to 1-10. But this proposition was made as a substitute for a still more inequitable system= namely, the saddling of the lands of the commonalty with the whole tax, and altogether exempting the lands of the nobles and clergy.

The public-spirited writer, who had occasion, in his character of engineer, to become personally acquainted with every part of France, speaks most feelingly of the hardships resulting from the land-tax 103 of those days. 

The adoption of his plan at that time would have been a vast relief to the country. 

But it was disregarded because every courtier had an interest to resist it= and this fine country was left to flounder through its distresses. The consequence was, a heavier loss of population from famine, than
from the sword, in the war of the Spanish succession.

It has likewise the advantage of excluding all exaction and injustice in the collection; the individual, when he gathers in
his harvest, knows exactly what he has to pay; and the state knows what it has to receive.

This tax, which might appear at first sight to be of all others the most equitable, is nevertheless of all others the most in-
equitable; for it makes no allowance for the advances made in the course of production, but is taken upon the gross, in-
stead of the net, product Take two farmers in different branches
of cultivation; the one farming tillage-land of moderate qual-
ity; his expenses of cultivation, amounting, one year with
another, say to 1600 dollars, and the gross product of his farm,
say to 2400 dollars, so as to yield him a net product of 800
dollars only; the other farming pasturage or wood-land, yield-
ing a gross product of precisely the same amount of 2400
dollars= with an expense of cultivation, amounting, perhaps,
to but 400 dollars, leaving him a net product, one year with
another, of 2000 dollars. Suppose a tax in kind to be imposed
in the ratio of 1-12 of the annual product of land of all de-
scriptions indiscriminately. 

The former will have to pay in sheaves of corn to the amount of 200 dollars; the latter will
pay, in cattle or in wood, an equal value of 200 dollars. What
is the result? 

The one will have paid the fourth part of a net
revenue of $800; the other but a tenth part of a net
revenue of $2000.

The difficulty and expense of collection, together with the
abuses to which it is liable, are another objection to taxation
in kind. The immense number of agents must open a fine field
for peculation. The government may be imposed upon, in
respect to the amount collected, upon the subsequent sale and
disposal, in respect to the quantity damaged, as well as in the
charges of storing, preservation and carriage. If the tax be
farmed to contractors, the profits and expenses of numberless farmers and contractors must all fall upon the public.
The prosecution of the farmers and contractors would require
the active vigilance of administration. 

‘A gentleman of great
fortune,’ says Smith, ‘who lived in the capital, would be in
danger of suffering much by the neglect, and more by the
fraud, of his factors and agents, if the rents of an estate in a
distant province were to be paid to him in this manner. The
loss of the sovereign, from the abuse and depredation of his
tax-gatherers, would necessarily be much greater.’ 104
Various other objections have been urged against taxation in
kind, which it would be useless and tedious to enumerate. I
shall only take the liberty of remarking the violent operation
upon relative price, which must follow from so vast a quan-
tity of produce being thrown upon the market by the agents
of the public revenue, who are notoriously equally improvi-
dent as buyers and- as sellers. The necessity of clearing the
storehouses to make room for the fresh crop, and the ever
urgent demands upon the public pulse, would oblige them to
sell below the level, to which the price would naturally be
brought by the rent of the land, the wages of labour, and the
interest of the capital, engaged in agriculture; and private
dealers would be unable to maintain the competition. Such
taxation rot only takes from the cultivator a portion of his
product, but prevents his turning the residue to good account.
The revenue, that each person has for his own share, is the
net residue only after replacing the capital he has embarked,
whatever may be its amount. Is the gross amount of the sales
he effects in the year the annual income of the merchant?
Certainly not; all the income he gets is the surplus of his re-
ceipts above his advances; on this surplus alone can he pay
taxes, without ruin to his concerns. The ecclesiastical tithe
levied in France under the old system was liable to this in-
convenience in part only. It attached neither upon meadow,
nor wood-land, nor kitchen-ground, nor many other kinds of
cultivation; and in some places was 1-18, in others 1-15 or 1-
10 of the gross product; so that the real, was corrected by the
apparent inequality.

cultivated spots, were rated very high. Since then, the tor-
rents and inundations have been confined by drainage and
embankment, and the plains reduced to fertility; their pro-
duce, being comparatively exempt from tax, came to market
cheaper than that of the uplands, which, consequently, were
unable to maintain the competition, under the pressure of dis-
proportionate taxation, and have gradually been abandoned
and deserted. 105 Whereas, had the tax been adjusted to the
change of circumstances, both might have been cultivated
together.


## Section 4. The Territorial or Land-Tax of England.

1692 was 4 years after the happy revolution that placed the prince of Orange on the British throne. In that year, a general valuation was made of the income of all the land in the country. Upon that valuation, the land-tax continues to be levied to this day. The tax of 4 shillings in the pound, upon the rents of land, is 1/5 of its rent in 1692, and not of the actual rent at the present day.

In speaking of a tax, peculiar to a particular nation, I have u:ed it merely in illustration of general and universal principles.

This tax encourages improvements of the land. An estate that has been improved so as to double the rent, does not pay double the original tax; neither does it pay a less tax if it be suffered to fall into neglect and impoverishment; thus, it operates as a penalty upon negligence.
