To this fixation of the tax, many writers attribute the high state of the cultivation of the land in England. 

It may have done much to promote improvement. But, what would be thought of a government that should say to a tradesman in a small way of business, “You are trading in a small way upon a small capital, and consequently pay very little in direct taxes. 

Borrow, and enlarge your capital, extend your dealings, and increase your profits as much as you can, and we will not charge you with any increase of taxes. Nay, further, when your heirs succeed to the business, and have still
further extended it, they shall be assessed at precisely the same rate, and shall continue subject to the same taxes only.”
All this might be a vast encouragement to trade and manufacture; but would there be any equity in such a proceeding? and
might they not advance without such assistance? 

Has not England herself presented the example of a still more rapid improvement in commercial and manufacturing industry, without any such unjust partiality? A land-owner, by attention, economy, and intelligence, improves his annual income to
the amount, say of 1000 dollars= if the state claim a fifth of this advance, there will still be a bonus of 800 dollars to stimulate and reward his exertions.


## Section 1: The Contracting Debt by National Authority, and of its general Effect

There is this grand distinction between an individual borrower and a borrowing government, that, in general, the former borrows capital for the purpose of beneficial employment, the latter for the purpose of barren consumption and expenditure. 

A nation borrows, either to satisfy an unlooked-for demand, or to meet an extraordinary emergency; to which ends, the loan may prove effectual or ineffectual= but, in either case, the whole sum borrowed is so much value consumed and lost, and the public revenue remains burthened with the interest upon it.

Melon maintains, that a national debt is no more than a debt from the right hand to the left, which nowise enfeebles the body politic. But he is mistaken; the state is enfeebled, inasmuch as the capital lent to its government, having been destroyed in the consumption of it by the government, can no longer yield any body the profit, or in other words, the interest, it might earn, in the character of a productive means.
Wherewith, then, is the government to pay the interest of its debt? 

Why, with a portion of the revenue arising from some other source, which it must transfer from the tax-payer to the
public creditor for the purpose. 

It would be easy to put cases, in which the tax, becoming by its fixation disproportionate to the means of the tax-payers
and the condition of the soil, might be productive of as much mischief, as it has done good in other instances= where it would
operate to throw out of cultivation a class of land, that, by one cause or other, had become incompetent to pay the same
ratio of taxation. We have seen an example of this in Tuscany.

There, a census or terrier was made in 1496, wherein the plains and valleys were rated very low, on account of the frequent
floods and inundations, which prevented any regular and profitable cultivation; while the uplands, that were then the only
Before the act of borrowing, there will have been in exist-
ence two productive capitals, each of them yielding, or ca-
pable of yielding, revenue; that is to say, a capital about to be
lent to government, and a capital whereon the future tax-pay-
ers derive that revenue, which is about to be applied in satis-
faction of the interest upon the capital lent. After the act of


The appointment to posts and offices, under condition of an annual payment, or of deposit for which the government en-
gages to pay interest, is a mode of borrowing in perpetuity, in
which the loan is compulsory. When once this paltry expedient is resorted to, it requires very little ingenuity to find plau-
sible grounds, for converting almost every occupation, down to the dust-man and street-porter, into patent and saleable
offices.

borrowing, there will remain but one of these capitals; viz.
the latter of the two, whereof the revenue is thenceforward
no longer at the disposal of its former possessors, the present
tax-payers, since it must be taken in some form of taxation or
other by the government, for the sake of providing the pay-
ment of interest to its creditors. The lender loses no part of
his revenue= the only loser is the payer of taxes.

People are apt to suppose, that, because national loans do not necessarily occasion any diminution of the national money
or specie, therefore, they occasion, not a loss but merely a transfer, of national wealth. With a view to the more ready
exposure of this fallacy, I have subjoined a synoptical table,
showing what becomes of the sum borrowed, and whence the
public creditor’s interest is satisfied. 106

Another mode of borrowing is, by the anticipation of rev-
enue. by which is meant, the assignment by a government of
revenues not yet due, with allowance in the nature of dis-
count, the taking up money in advance from lenders, who
charge a discount proportionate to the risk they run from the
instability of the government and possible deficiency of the
revenue. Engagements of this kind contracted by a government, and satisfied either out of the revenue when collected,
or by the issue of fresh bills upon the public treasury, constitute what bears the uncouth English denomination of floating
debt; the consolidated debt being that, whereon the creditor
can demand the interest only, and not the principal.

When a government borrows, it either does or does not engage to repay the principal. In the latter case, it grants what is
called a perpetual annuity. Redeemable loans are capable of
infinite variety in the terms. 

The principal is contracted to be repaid, sometimes gradually, and in the way of lottery; sometimes by instalments payable together with the interest, sometimes in the way of increased interest, with condition to ex-
pire on the death of the lender; as in the case of tontines and
life-annuities, whereof the latter determine on the death of
the individual lender; whereas, in tontines, the full interest
continues to be divided amongst the survivors, until the whole
of the lives have expired.

National loans of every kind are attended with the universal
disadvantage of withdrawing capital from productive employ-
ment, and diverting it into the channel of barren consump-
tion; and, in countries where the credit of the government is
at a low ebb, with the further and particular disadvantage, of
raising the interest of capital. Who can be expected to lend at
5 per cent to the farmer, the manufacturer, or the merchant,
while he can readily get an offer of 7 or 8 per cent from the
government? That class of revenue which has been called,
profit of capital, is thereby advanced in its ratio, at the ex-
pense of the consumer= the consumption falls off, in conse-
quence of the advance in the real price of products; the pro-
ductive agency of the other sources of production are less in
demand, and consequently worse paid; and the whole com-
munity is the sufferer, with the sole exception of the capitalist.

Tontines and life-annuities are very improvident modes of
borrowing; for the borrower remains throughout liable to the
full rate of interest, although he annually repays a part of the
principal. Besides, they savour of immorality; offering a pre-
mium to egotism, and a stimulus to the dilapidation of capi-
tal, by enabling the lender to consume both principal and in-
terest without fear of personal beggary.

The governments best acquainted with the business of borrowing and lending have not, of late years at least, given any
engagement to repay the principal of the loan. Thus, public
creditors have no other way of altering the investment of their
capital, except by selling their transferable security, which
they can do with more or less advantage to themselves, ac-
cording to the buyer’s opinion of the solidity of the debtor
government, that has granted the perpetual annuity. 107 Des-
potic governments have always found a great difficulty in
negotiating such loans. Where the sovereign is powerful
enough to violate his contracts at pleasure, or where there is a
mere personal contract with the reigning monarch, with a risk
of disavowal by the successor, lenders are loth to advance
their money, without a near and definite period of payment.
The ability to borrow affords one main advantage to the state,
namely, the power of apportioning the burthen entailed by a
sudden emergency among a great number of successive years.
In the present state of public affairs, and on the present scale
of international warfare, no country could support the enor-
mous expense from its ordinary annual revenue. The larger
states pay in taxation nearly as much as they are able; for
economy is by no means the order of the day with them; and
their ordinary expenditure seldom falls much short of the in-
come. If the expenditure must be doubled to save the nation
from ruin, borrowing is usually the only resource unless it
can make up its mind to violate all subsisting engagements
and be guilty of spoliation of its own subjects and foreigners
too. The faculty of borrowing is a more powerful agent, than


A national debt has been said to bind the public creditors
more firmly to the government, and make them its natural
supporters by a sense of common interest; and so it does,
beyond all doubt. But, as this common interest may attach
equally to a bad or a good government, there is just as much
chance, of its being an injury, as a benefit to a nation. If we
look at England, we shall see a vast number of well-meaning
persons, induced by this motive to uphold the abuses and
misgovernment of a wretched administration.
even gunpowder; but probably the gross abuse that is made
of it, will soon destroy its efficacy.

Great pains have been taken, to find in the system of borrowing, as well as in taxation, some inherent advantage beyond
that of supplying the public consumption. But a close examination will expose the hopelessness of such an attempt.
It has been maintained, for instance, that the debentures and securities, which form a national debt, become real and sub-
stantial values, existing within the community; that the capital, of which they are the evidence or representative, is so
much positive wealth, and must be reckoned as an item of the total substance of the nation. 108 But it is not so; a written contract or security is a mere evidence, that such or such property belongs to such an individual. But wealth consists in the
property itself, and not in the parchment, by which its ownership is evidenced; therefore el fortiori, a security is not even
an evidence of wealth, where it does not represent an actual existing value, and when it operates as a mere power of attor-
ney from the government to its creditor, enabling him to receive annually a specified portion of the revenue expected to
be levied upon the tax-payers at large. Supposing the security to be cancelled, as it might be by a national bankruptcy,
would there be any the least diminution of wealth in the community? Undoubtedly not. The only difference would be, that
the revenue, which before went to the public creditor, would now be at the disposal of the tax-payer, from whom it used to
be taken. 

A national debt is an index of the public opinion, respecting the degree of credit which the
government deserves, and operates as a motive to its good
conduct, and endeavours to preserve the public opinion, of
which such a debt furnishes the index. This can not be admit-
ted without some qualification. The good conduct of govern-
ment in the eyes of the public creditors, consists in the regu-
lar payment of their own dividends; but in the eyes of the tax-
payers, it consists in spending as little as possible. The mar-
ket-price of stock does, indeed, furnish a tolerable index of
the former kind of good conduct, but not of the latter. Per-
haps it would be no exaggeration to say, that the punctual
payments of the dividends, instead of being a sign of good, is
in numberless instances a cloak to bad, government; and, in
some countries, a boon for the toleration of frequent and glaring abuses.

Another argument in favour of national debt is, that it affords
a prompt investment to capital, which can find no ready and
profitable employment, and thus must, at any rate, prevent its
emigration. If it do, so much the worse= it is a bait to tempt
capital towards its destruction, leaving the nation burthened
with the annual interest, which government must provide. It
is far better that the capital should emigrate, as it would prob-
ably return sooner or later= and then its interest for the mean
time will be chargeable to foreigners. A national debt of mod-
erate amount, the capital of which should have been well and
judiciously expended in useful works, might indeed be at-
tended with the advantage of providing an investment for
minute portions of capital, in the hands of persons incapable
of turning them to account, who would probably keep them
locked up, or spend them by driblets, but for the convenience
of such an investment. This is perhaps the sole benefit of a
national debt; and even this is attended with some danger;
inasmuch as it enables a government to squander the national
savings. For, unless the principal be spent upon objects of
permanent public benefit, as on roads, canals. or the like, it
were better for the public, that the capital should re main in-
active, or concealed; since, if the public lost the use of it, at
least it would not have to pay the interest.
Those who tell us, that the annual circulation is increased by
the whole amount of the annual disbursements of the govern-
ment, 109 forget that these disbursements are made out of the
annual products and are a portion of the annual revenue, taken
from the tax-payer, which would have been brought into the
general circulation just the same, although no such thing as
national debt had existed. The tax-payer would have spent
what is now spent by the public creditor; that is all.
The sale or purchase of debentures or securities is not a pro-
ductive circulation, but a mere substitution of one public credi-
tor in place of another. When these transfers degenerate into
stock-jobbing, that is to say, the making of a profit by the rise
and fall of their price, they are productive of much mischief;
in the first place, by the unproductive employment on this
object of the agent of circulation, money, which is an item of
the national capital; and, in the next, by procuring a gain to
one person by the loss of another; which is the characteristic
of all gaming. The occupation of the stock-jobber yields no
new or useful product; consequently having no product of his
own to give in exchange, he has no revenue to subsist upon,
but what he contrives to make out of the unskilfulness or ill-
fortune of gamesters like himself.

Thus, it may be expedient to borrow, when capital must be
spent by a government, having nothing but the usufruct at its

command but we are not to imagine, that, by the act of borrowing, the public prosperity can be advanced. The borrower,
whether a sovereign, or an individual, incurs an annual charge
upon his revenue, besides impoverishing himself to the full
amount of the principal, if it be consumed; and nations never
borrow but with a view to consume outright. another thing, that facilitates the borrowing of government
even more than the credit it is fairly entitled to; and that is,
the great facility of transfer presented to the stockholder. Pub-
lic creditors always reckon upon the possibility of withdraw-
ing by the sale of their debentures, before the occurrence of
embarrassment or bankruptcy; and, even where they contem-
plate such a risk, generally consider some advance of the rate
of interest a sufficient premium of insurance against it.
