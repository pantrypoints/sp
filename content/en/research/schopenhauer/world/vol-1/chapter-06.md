In this Book 1, I consider everything as idea, as object for the subject.

Our own body is:
- the starting-point for our perception of the world.
- also an idea

The consciousness of every one is opposed to:
- these objects as mere ideas
- our own bodies

<!--  for the thing in itself is known
to each of us immediately in so far as it appears as our own
body; but in so far as it objectifies itself in the other objects of
perception, it is known only indirectly. But this abstraction, this
one-sided treatment, this forcible separation of what is essentially
and necessarily united, is only adopted to meet the demands of
our argument;

Therefore the disinclination to it must, in the
meantime, be suppressed and silenced by the expectation that
the subsequent treatment will correct the one-sidedness of the
present one, and complete our knowledge of the nature of the
world. -->


Just for discussion, I make the body as our immediate object.

This is because the body precedes the application of cause and effect and thus supplies it with its first data. 

The whole nature of matter consists in its causal action.

But cause and effect exist only for the [mind] understanding which is merely their subjective correlative. 

The understanding could come into operation if it had the immediate consciousness of the changes of the body, by virtue of which it is immediate
object. 

Thus the knowing of perception depends on 2 conditions:

1. The power of material things to act on each other, to produce changes in each other.

This is objectively expressed.

Without this common quality of all bodies, no perception would be possible, even by means of the
sensibility of the animal body. 

Subjectively we say: The [mind] understanding first makes perception possible because cause and effect springs only from the [mind] understanding.

<!--  and is
valid only for it, and therefore the world of perception exists
only through and for it. The second condition is -->

2. The sensibility of animal bodies

<!-- This is the quality of being immediate objects of the subject which certain bodies possess. -->

The sense organs:
- are changed by the outside through their specific affections
- may here be called ideas


The affections that produce neither pain nor pleasure have no immediate significance for the willpower, yet perceived.
- And so they exist only for knowledge. 

<!-- Thus far, then, I say that the body
is immediately known, is immediate object. But the conception
of object is not to be taken here in its fullest sense, for through
this immediate knowledge of the body, which precedes the
operation of the understanding, and is mere sensation, our own
[025] body does not exist specifically as object, but first the material
things which affect it: for  -->


All knowledge of an object proper, of an idea perceived in space, exists only through and for the
understanding.

Therefore not before, but only subsequently to its
operation. Therefore the body as object proper, that is, as an
idea perceived in space, is first known indirectly, like all other
objects, through the application of the law of causality to the
action of one of its parts upon another, as, for example, when the
eye sees the body or the hand touches it. Consequently the form
of our body does not become known to us through mere feeling,
but only through knowledge, only in idea; that is to say, only in
the brain does our own body first come to appear as extended,
articulate, organic. A man born blind receives this idea only little
by little from the data afforded by touch. A blind man without
hands could never come to know his own form; or at the most
could infer and construct it little by little from the effects of other
bodies upon him. If, then, we call the body an immediate object,
we are to be understood with these reservations.
In other respects, then, according to what has been said, all
animal bodies are immediate objects; that is, starting-points for
the subject which always knows and therefore is never known
in its perception of the world. Thus the distinctive characteristic
of animal life is knowledge, with movement following on
motives, which are determined by knowledge, just as movement
47
following on stimuli is the distinctive characteristic of plant-life.
Unorganised matter, however, has no movement except such as
is produced by causes properly so called, using the term in its
narrowest sense. All this I have thoroughly discussed in my essay
on the principle of sufficient reason, § 20, in the “Ethics,” first
essay, iii., and in my work on Sight and Colour, § 1, to which I
therefore refer.
It follows from what has been said, that all animals, even the [026]
least developed, have understanding; for they all know objects,
and this knowledge determines their movements as motive.
Understanding is the same in all animals and in all men; it
has everywhere the same simple form; knowledge of causality,
transition from effect to cause, and from cause to effect, nothing
more; but the degree of its acuteness, and the extension of the
sphere of its knowledge varies enormously, with innumerable
gradations from the lowest form, which is only conscious of
the causal connection between the immediate object and objects
affecting it—that is to say, perceives a cause as an object in
space by passing to it from the affection which the body feels, to
the higher grades of knowledge of the causal connection among
objects known indirectly, which extends to the understanding
of the most complicated system of cause and effect in nature.
For even this high degree of knowledge is still the work of
the understanding, not of the reason. The abstract concepts of
the reason can only serve to take up the objective connections
which are immediately known by the understanding, to make
them permanent for thought, and to relate them to each other; but
reason never gives us immediate knowledge. Every force and law
of nature, every example of such forces and laws, must first be
immediately known by the understanding, must be apprehended
through perception before it can pass into abstract consciousness
for reason. Hooke's discovery of the law of gravitation, and the
reference of so many important phenomena to this one law, was
the work of immediate apprehension by the understanding; and
48 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
such also was the proof of Newton's calculations, and Lavoisier's
discovery of acids and their important function in nature, and also
Goethe's discovery of the origin of physical colours. All these
discoveries are nothing more than a correct immediate passage
from the effect to the cause, which is at once followed by the
recognition of the ideality of the force of nature which expresses
[027] itself in all causes of the same kind; and this complete insight
is just an example of that single function of the understanding,
by which an animal perceives as an object in space the cause
which affects its body, and differs from such a perception only
in degree. Every one of these great discoveries is therefore, just
like perception, an operation of the understanding, an immediate
intuition, and as such the work of an instant, an apperçu, a
flash of insight. They are not the result of a process of abstract
reasoning, which only serves to make the immediate knowledge
of the understanding permanent for thought by bringing it under
abstract concepts, i.e., it makes knowledge distinct, it puts us in
a position to impart it and explain it to others. The keenness of
the understanding in apprehending the causal relations of objects
which are known indirectly, does not find its only application in
the sphere of natural science (though all the discoveries in that
sphere are due to it), but it also appears in practical life. It is
then called good sense or prudence, as in its other application it
is better called acuteness, penetration, sagacity. More exactly,
good sense or prudence signifies exclusively understanding at
the command of the will. But the limits of these conceptions
must not be too sharply defined, for it is always that one function
of the understanding by means of which all animals perceive
objects in space, which, in its keenest form, appears now in the
phenomena of nature, correctly inferring the unknown causes
from the given effects, and providing the material from which
the reason frames general rules as laws of nature; now inventing
complicated and ingenious machines by adapting known causes
to desired effects; now in the sphere of motives, seeing through
49
and frustrating intrigues and machinations, or fitly disposing
the motives and the men who are susceptible to them, setting
them in motion, as machines are moved by levers and wheels,
and directing them at will to the accomplishment of its ends.
Deficiency of understanding is called stupidity. It is just dulness [028]
in applying the law of causality, incapacity for the immediate
apprehension of the concatenations of causes and effects, motives
and actions. A stupid person has no insight into the connection
of natural phenomena, either when they follow their own course,
or when they are intentionally combined, i.e., are applied to
machinery. Such a man readily believes in magic and miracles.
A stupid man does not observe that persons, who apparently
act independently of each other, are really in collusion; he is
therefore easily mystified, and outwitted; he does not discern the
hidden motives of proffered advice or expressions of opinion,
&c. But it is always just one thing that he lacks—keenness,
rapidity, ease in applying the law of causality, i.e., power of
understanding. The greatest, and, in this reference, the most
instructive example of stupidity I ever met with, was the case
of a totally imbecile boy of about eleven years of age, in an
asylum. He had reason, because he spoke and comprehended,
but in respect of understanding he was inferior to many of the
lower animals. Whenever I visited him he noticed an eye-glass
which I wore round my neck, and in which the window of the
room and the tops of the trees beyond were reflected: on every
occasion he was greatly surprised and delighted with this, and
was never tired of looking at it with astonishment, because he
did not understand the immediate causation of reflection.



























Here I consider everything merely as idea, as object for the subject. 

Our own body is the starting-point for each of us in our perception
of the world, we consider, like all other real objects, from the
side of its knowableness, and in this regard it is simply an idea.

The consciousness of every one is in general opposed to the
explanation of objects as mere ideas, and more especially to the explanation of our bodies as such; for the thing in itself is known
to each of us immediately in so far as it appears as our own
body; but in so far as it objectifies itself in the other objects of
perception, it is known only indirectly. 

But this abstraction, this
one-sided treatment, this forcible separation of what is essentially
and necessarily united, is only adopted to meet the demands of
our argument; and therefore the disinclination to it must, in the
meantime, be suppressed and silenced by the expectation that
the subsequent treatment will correct the one-sidedness of the
present one, and complete our knowledge of the nature of the
world.

At present therefore the body is for us immediate object; that idea which forms the starting-point of the
subject's knowledge; because the body, with its immediately
known changes, precedes the application of the law of causality,
and thus supplies it with its first data. The whole nature of matter
consists, as we have seen, in its causal action. But cause and
effect exist only for the understanding, which is nothing but their
subjective correlative. 

The understanding, however, could never
come into operation if there were not something else from which
it starts. This is simple sensation—the immediate consciousness
of the changes of the body, by virtue of which it is immediate
object. 

Thus the possibility of knowing the world of perception
depends upon two conditions; the first, objectively expressed, is
the power of material things to act upon each other, to produce
changes in each other, without which common quality of all
bodies no perception would be possible, even by means of the
sensibility of the animal body. 

If we wish to express this
condition subjectively we say: The understanding first makes
perception possible; for the law of causality, the possibility of
effect and cause, springs only from the understanding, and is
valid only for it, and therefore the world of perception exists
only through and for it. The second condition is the sensibility
of animal bodies, or the quality of being immediate objects of
46 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the subject which certain bodies possess. The mere modification
which the organs of sense sustain from without through their
specific affections, may here be called ideas, so far as these
affections produce neither pain nor pleasure, that is, have no
immediate significance for the will, and are yet perceived, exist
therefore only for knowledge. Thus far, then, I say that the body
is immediately known, is immediate object. But the conception
of object is not to be taken here in its fullest sense, for through
this immediate knowledge of the body, which precedes the
operation of the understanding, and is mere sensation, our own
body does not exist specifically as object, but first the material[025]
things which affect it: for all knowledge of an object proper,
of an idea perceived in space, exists only through and for the
understanding; therefore not before, but only subsequently to its
operation. Therefore the body as object proper, that is, as an
idea perceived in space, is first known indirectly, like all other
objects, through the application of the law of causality to the
action of one of its parts upon another, as, for example, when the
eye sees the body or the hand touches it. Consequently the form
of our body does not become known to us through mere feeling,
but only through knowledge, only in idea; that is to say, only in

articulate, organic. A man born blind receives this idea only little
by little from the data afforded by touch. A blind man without

47

was never tired of looking at it with astonishment, because he
did not understand the immediate causation of reflection.
While the difference in degree of the acuteness of the
understanding, is very great between man and man, it is even
greater between one species of animal and another. In all species
of animals, even those which are nearest to plants, there is at
least as much understanding as suffices for the inference from
the effect on the immediate object, to the indirectly known object as its cause, i.e., sufficient for perception, for the apprehension
of an object. For it is this that constitutes them animals, as it
gives them the power of movement following on motives, and
thereby the power of seeking for food, or at least of seizing[029]
it; whereas plants have only movement following on stimuli,
whose direct influence they must await, or else decay, for they
cannot seek after them nor appropriate them. We marvel at the
great sagacity of the most developed species of animals, such as
the dog, the elephant, the monkey or the fox, whose cleverness
has been so admirably sketched by Buffon. From these most
sagacious animals, we can pretty accurately determine how far
understanding can go without reason, i.e., abstract knowledge
embodied in concepts. We could not find this out from ourselves,
for in us understanding and reason always reciprocally support
each other. 

We find that the manifestation of understanding
in animals is sometimes above our expectation, and sometimes
below it. On the one hand, we are surprised at the sagacity
of the elephant, who, after crossing many bridges during his
journey in Europe, once refused to go upon one, because he
thought it was not strong enough to bear his weight, though he
saw the rest of the party, consisting of men and horses, go upon
it as usual. On the other hand, we wonder that the intelligent
Orang-outangs, who warm themselves at a fire they have found,
do not keep it alight by throwing wood on it; a proof that this
requires a deliberation which is not possible without abstract
concepts. It is clear that the knowledge of cause and effect, as
the universal form of understanding, belongs to all animals a
priori, because to them as to us it is the prior condition of all
perception of the outer world. If any one desires additional proof
of this, let him observe, for example, how a young dog is afraid
to jump down from a table, however much he may wish to do so,
because he foresees the effect of the weight of his body, though
he has not been taught this by experience. 

In judging of the
understanding of animals, we must guard against ascribing to it the manifestations of instinct, a faculty which is quite distinct
both from understanding and reason, but the action of which [030]
is often very analogous to the combined action of the two. We
cannot, however, discuss this here; it will find its proper place
in the second book, when we consider the harmony or so-called
teleology of nature: and the 27th chapter of the supplementary
volume is expressly devoted to it.

Deficiency of understanding we call stupidity: deficiency in
the application of reason to practice we shall recognise later
as foolishness: deficiency of judgment as silliness, and lastly,
partial or entire deficiency of memory as madness. But each of
these will be considered in its own place. That which is correctly
known by reason is truth, that is, an abstract judgment on
sufficient grounds (Essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason,
§ 29 and following paragraphs); that which is correctly known
by understanding is reality, that is correct inference from effect
on the immediate object to its cause. Error is opposed to
truth, as deception of the reason: illusion is opposed to reality,
as deception of the understanding. The full discussion of all
this will be found in the first chapter of my essay on Light
and Colour. Illusion takes place when the same effect may be
attributed to two causes, of which one occurs very frequently, the
other very seldom; the understanding having no data to decide
which of these two causes operates in any particular case,—for
their effects are exactly alike,—always assumes the presence of
the commoner cause, and as the activity of the understanding
is not reflective and discursive, but direct and immediate, this
false cause appears before us as a perceived object, whereas it is
merely illusion. I have explained in the essay referred to, how in
this way double sight and double feeling take place if the organs
of sense are brought into an unusual position; and have thus given
an incontrovertible proof that perception exists only through and
for the understanding. 

As additional examples of such illusions
or deceptions of the understanding, we may mention the broken appearance of a stick dipped in water; the reflections in spherical[031]
mirrors, which, when the surface is convex appear somewhat
behind it, and when the surface is concave appear a long way
in front of it. To this class also belongs the apparently greater
extension of the moon at the horizon than at the zenith. This
appearance is not optical, for as the micrometre proves, the eye
receives the image of the moon at the zenith, at an even greater
angle of vision than at the horizon. The mistake is due to the
understanding, which assumes that the cause of the feebler light
of the moon and of all stars at the horizon is that they are further
off, thus treating them as earthly objects, according to the laws
of atmospheric perspective, and therefore it takes the moon to be
much larger at the horizon than at the zenith, and also regards
the vault of heaven as more extended or flattened out at the
horizon. 

The same false application of the laws of atmospheric
perspective leads us to suppose that very high mountains, whose
summits alone are visible in pure transparent air, are much nearer
than they really are, and therefore not so high as they are; for
example, Mont Blanc seen from Salenche. All such illusions are
immediately present to us as perceptions, and cannot be dispelled
by any arguments of the reason. Reason can only prevent error,
that is, a judgment on insufficient grounds, by opposing to it a
truth; as for example, the abstract knowledge that the cause of
the weaker light of the moon and the stars at the horizon is not
greater distance, but the denser atmosphere; but in all the cases
we have referred to, the illusion remains in spite of every abstract
explanation. For the understanding is in itself, even in the case
of man, irrational, and is completely and sharply distinguished
from the reason, which is a faculty of knowledge that belongs to
man alone. The reason can only know; perception remains free
from its influence and belongs to the understanding alone.
