Rational knowledge (wissen) is then all abstract knowledge.

It is the knowledge which is peculiar to the reason as distinguished from the understanding. 

Its contradictory opposite has just been explained to be the concept “feeling.”

Now, as reason only reproduces, for knowledge, what has
been received in another way, it does not actually extend our
knowledge, but only gives it another form. It enables us to
know in the abstract and generally, what first became known
in sense-perception, in the concrete. But this is much more
important than it appears at first sight when so expressed. 

For
it depends entirely upon the fact that knowledge has become
rational or abstract knowledge (wissen), that it can be safely
preserved, that it is communicable and susceptible of certain and wide-reaching application to practice. Knowledge in the form
of sense-perception is valid only of the particular case, extends
only to what is nearest, and ends with it, for sensibility and
understanding can only comprehend one object at a time. Every[069]
enduring, arranged, and planned activity must therefore proceed
from principles,—that is, from abstract knowledge, and it must
be conducted in accordance with them. 

Thus, for example,
the knowledge of the relation of cause and effect arrived at by
the understanding, is in itself far completer, deeper and more
exhaustive than anything that can be thought about it in the
abstract; the understanding alone knows in perception directly
and completely the nature of the effect of a lever, of a pulley, or
a cog-wheel, the stability of an arch, and so forth. But on account
of the peculiarity of the knowledge of perception just referred
to, that it only extends to what is immediately present, the mere
understanding can never enable us to construct machines and
buildings. Here reason must come in; it must substitute abstract
concepts for ideas of perception, and take them as the guide of
action; and if they are right, the anticipated result will happen. 

In
the same way we have perfect knowledge in pure perception of
the nature and constitution of the parabola, hyperbola, and spiral;
but if we are to make trustworthy application of this knowledge
to the real, it must first become abstract knowledge, and by this
it certainly loses its character of intuition or perception, but on
the other hand it gains the certainty and preciseness of abstract
knowledge. The differential calculus does not really extend our
knowledge of the curve, it contains nothing that was not already
in the mere pure perception of the curve; but it alters the kind of
knowledge, it changes the intuitive into an abstract knowledge,
which is so valuable for application. But here we must refer
to another peculiarity of our faculty of knowledge, which could
not be observed until the distinction between the knowledge of
the senses and understanding and abstract knowledge had been
made quite clear. It is this, that relations of space cannot as such be directly translated into abstract knowledge, but only
temporal quantities,—that is, numbers, are suitable for this. 

Numbers alone can be expressed in abstract concepts which
accurately correspond to them, not spacial quantities. The
concept “thousand” is just as different from the concept “ten,” as
both these temporal quantities are in perception. We think of a
thousand as a distinct multiple of ten, into which we can resolve
it at pleasure for perception in time,—that is to say, we can count
it. But between the abstract concept of a mile and that of a foot,
apart from any concrete perception of either, and without the help
of number, there is no accurate distinction corresponding to the
quantities themselves. In both we only think of a spacial quantity
in general, and if they must be completely distinguished we are
compelled either to call in the assistance of intuition or perception
in space, which would be a departure from abstract knowledge,
or we must think the difference in numbers. If then we wish to
have abstract knowledge of space-relations we must first translate
them into time-relations,—that is, into numbers; therefore only
arithmetic, and not geometry, is the universal science of quantity,
and geometry must be translated into arithmetic if it is to be
communicable, accurately precise and applicable in practice. It
is true that a space-relation as such may also be thought in the
abstract; for example, “the sine increases as the angle,” but if
the quantity of this relation is to be given, it requires number for
its expression. This necessity, that if we wish to have abstract
knowledge of space-relations (i.e., rational knowledge, not mere
intuition or perception), space with its three dimensions must be
translated into time which has only one dimension, this necessity
it is, which makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes very
clear if we compare the perception of curves with their analytical
calculation, or the table of logarithms of the trigonometrical
functions with the perception of the changing relations of the
parts of a triangle, which are expressed by them. What vast
mazes of figures, what laborious calculations it would require to express in the abstract what perception here apprehends at
a glance completely and with perfect accuracy, namely, how
the co-sine diminishes as the sine increases, how the co-sine
of one angle is the sine of another, the inverse relation of the
increase and decrease of the two angles, and so forth. 

How time must complain, that with its one dimension it
should be compelled to express the three dimensions of space!
Yet this is necessary if we wish to possess, for application, an
expression, in abstract concepts, of space-relations. They could
not be translated directly into abstract concepts, but only through
the medium of the pure temporal quantity, number, which alone
is directly related to abstract knowledge. Yet it is worthy of
remark, that as space adapts itself so well to perception, and
by means of its three dimensions, even its complicated relations
are easily apprehended, while it eludes the grasp of abstract
knowledge; time, on the contrary, passes easily into abstract
knowledge, but gives very little to perception. Our perceptions
of numbers in their proper element, mere time, without the help
of space, scarcely extends as far as ten, and beyond that we have
only abstract concepts of numbers, no knowledge of them which
can be presented in perception. On the other hand, we connect
with every numeral, and with all algebraical symbols, accurately
defined abstract concepts.

Some minds only find full
satisfaction in what is known through perception. What they
seek is the reason and consequent of being in space, sensuously
expressed; a demonstration after the manner of Euclid, or an
arithmetical solution of spacial problems, does not please them.
Other minds, on the contrary, seek merely the abstract concepts
which are needful for applying and communicating knowledge.
They have patience and memory for abstract principles, formulas,
demonstrations in long trains of reasoning, and calculations, in
which the symbols represent the most complicated abstractions.[072]
The latter seek preciseness, the former sensible perception. The 

difference is characteristic.
The greatest value of rational or abstract knowledge is that it
can be communicated and permanently retained. It is principally
on this account that it is so inestimably important for practice.
Any one may have a direct perceptive knowledge through the
understanding alone, of the causal connection, of the changes
and motions of natural bodies, and he may find entire satisfaction
in it; but he cannot communicate this knowledge to others until
it has been made permanent for thought in concepts. Knowledge
of the first kind is even sufficient for practice, if a man puts
his knowledge into practice himself, in an action which can
be accomplished while the perception is still vivid; but it is
not sufficient if the help of others is required, or even if the
action is his own but must be carried out at different times, and
therefore requires a pre-conceived plan. Thus, for example, a
practised billiard-player may have a perfect knowledge of the
laws of the impact of elastic bodies upon each other, merely in
the understanding, merely for direct perception; and for him it is
quite sufficient; but on the other hand it is only the man who has
studied the science of mechanics, who has, properly speaking,
a rational knowledge of these laws, that is, a knowledge of
them in the abstract. Such knowledge of the understanding in
perception is sufficient even for the construction of machines,
when the inventor of the machine executes the work himself;
as we often see in the case of talented workmen, who have no
scientific knowledge. But whenever a number of men, and their
united action taking place at different times, is required for the
completion of a mechanical work, of a machine, or a building,
then he who conducts it must have thought out the plan in the
abstract, and such co-operative activity is only possible through
the assistance of reason. It is, however, remarkable that in [073]
the first kind of activity, in which we have supposed that one
man alone, in an uninterrupted course of action, accomplishes
something, abstract knowledge, the application of reason or
92 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
reflection, may often be a hindrance to him; for example, in the
case of billiard-playing, of fighting, of tuning an instrument, or
in the case of singing. Here perceptive knowledge must directly
guide action; its passage through reflection makes it uncertain,
for it divides the attention and confuses the man. Thus savages
and untaught men, who are little accustomed to think, perform
certain physical exercises, fight with beasts, shoot with bows
and arrows and the like, with a certainty and rapidity which the
reflecting European never attains to, just because his deliberation
makes him hesitate and delay. For he tries, for example, to
hit the right position or the right point of time, by finding out
the mean between two false extremes; while the savage hits it
directly without thinking of the false courses open to him. In
the same way it is of no use to me to know in the abstract
the exact angle, in degrees and minutes, at which I must apply
a razor, if I do not know it intuitively, that is, if I have not
got it in my touch. The knowledge of physiognomy also, is
interfered with by the application of reason. This knowledge
must be gained directly through the understanding. We say that
the expression, the meaning of the features, can only be felt, that
is, it cannot be put into abstract concepts. Every man has his
direct intuitive method of physiognomy and pathognomy, yet
one man understands more clearly than another these signatura
rerum. But an abstract science of physiognomy to be taught
and learned is not possible; for the distinctions of difference are
here so fine that concepts cannot reach them; therefore abstract
knowledge is related to them as a mosaic is to a painting by a
Van der Werft or a Denner. In mosaics, however fine they may
be, the limits of the stones are always there, and therefore no
continuous passage from one colour to another is possible, and[074]
this is also the case with regard to concepts, with their rigidity
and sharp delineation; however finely we may divide them by
exact definition, they are still incapable of reaching the finer
modifications of the perceptible, and this is just what happens in
93
the example we have taken, knowledge of physiognomy.16
This quality of concepts by which they resemble the stones of
a mosaic, and on account of which perception always remains
their asymptote, is also the reason why nothing good is produced
in art by their means. If the singer or the virtuoso attempts to
guide his execution by reflection he remains silent. And this
is equally true of the composer, the painter, and the poet. The
concept always remains unfruitful in art; it can only direct the
technical part of it, its sphere is science. We shall consider
more fully in the third book, why all true art proceeds from
sensuous knowledge, never from the concept. Indeed, with
regard to behaviour also, and personal agreeableness in society,
the concept has only a negative value in restraining the grosser
manifestations of egotism and brutality; so that a polished manner
is its commendable production. But all that is attractive, gracious,
charming in behaviour, all affectionateness and friendliness, must
not proceed from the concepts, for if it does, “we feel intention,
and are put out of tune.” All dissimulation is the work of
reflection; but it cannot be maintained constantly and without
interruption: “nemo potest personam diu ferre fictum,” says [075]
Seneca in his book de clementia; and so it is generally found
out and loses its effect. Reason is needed in the full stress
of life, where quick conclusions, bold action, rapid and sure
comprehension are required, but it may easily spoil all if it gains
16 I am therefore of opinion that a science of physiognomy cannot, with
certainty, go further than to lay down a few quite general rules. For example,
the intellectual qualities are to be read in the forehead and the eyes; the moral
qualities, the expression of will, in the mouth and lower part of the face. The
forehead and the eyes interpret each other; either of them seen alone can only
be half understood. Genius is never without a high, broad, finely-arched brow;
but such a brow often occurs where there is no genius. A clever-looking
person may the more certainly be judged to be so the uglier the face is; and a
stupid-looking person may the more certainly be judged to be stupid the more
beautiful the face is; for beauty, as the approximation to the type of humanity,
carries in and for itself the expression of mental clearness; the opposite is the
case with ugliness, and so forth.


the upper hand, and by perplexing hinders the intuitive, direct
discovery, and grasp of the right by simple understanding, and
thus induces irresolution.

Lastly, virtue and holiness do not proceed from reflection, but
from the inner depths of the will, and its relation to knowledge.
The exposition of this belongs to another part of our work;
this, however, I may remark here, that the dogmas relating to
ethics may be the same in the reason of whole nations, but the
action of every individual different; and the converse also holds
good; action, we say, is guided by feelings,—that is, simply not
by concepts, but as a matter of fact by the ethical character.
Dogmas occupy the idle reason; but action in the end pursues its
own course independently of them, generally not according to
abstract rules, but according to unspoken maxims, the expression
of which is the whole man himself. Therefore, however different
the religious dogmas of nations may be, yet in the case of all of
them, a good action is accompanied by unspeakable satisfaction,
and a bad action by endless remorse. No mockery can shake
the former; no priest's absolution can deliver from the latter.
Notwithstanding this, we must allow, that for the pursuit of a
virtuous life, the application of reason is needful; only it is not its
source, but has the subordinate function of preserving resolutions
which have been made, of providing maxims to withstand the
weakness of the moment, and give consistency to action. It plays
the same part ultimately in art also, where it has just as little to do
with the essential matter, but assists in carrying it out, for genius
is not always at call, and yet the work must be completed in all
its parts and rounded off to a whole.
