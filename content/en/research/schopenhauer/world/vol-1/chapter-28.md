We have considered the great multiplicity and diversity of the phenomena in which the will objectifies itself, and we have
seen their endless and implacable strife with each other. 

Yet the will itself, as thing-in-itself, is by no means included in that multiplicity
and change. 

The diversity of the (Platonic) Ideas, i.e., grades of objectification, the multitude of individuals in which each of
these expresses itself, the struggle of forms for matter,—all this
does not concern it, but is only the manner of its objectification,
and only through this has an indirect relation to it, by virtue
of which it belongs to the expression of the nature of will for
the idea. As the magic-lantern shows many different pictures,
which are all made visible by one and the same light, so in [200]
all the multifarious phenomena which fill the world together
or throng after each other as events, only one will manifests
itself, of which everything is the visibility, the objectivity, and
which remains unmoved in the midst of this change; it alone
is thing-in-itself; all objects are manifestations, or, to speak the
language of Kant, phenomena. 

Although in man, as (Platonic) Idea, the will finds its clearest and fullest objectification, yet man alone could not express its being. In order to manifest the full significance of the will, the Idea of man would need to appear,
not alone and sundered from everything else, but accompanied
by the whole series of grades, down through all the forms of
animals, through the vegetable kingdom to unorganised nature.

All these supplement each other in the complete objectification
of will; they are as much presupposed by the Idea of man as
the blossoms of a tree presuppose leaves, branches, stem, and
root; they form a pyramid, of which man is the apex. If fond of
similes, one might also say that their manifestations accompany
that of man as necessarily as the full daylight is accompanied by
all the gradations of twilight, through which, little by little, it
loses itself in darkness; or one might call them the echo of man,
and say: Animal and plant are the descending fifth and third of
man, the inorganic kingdom is the lower octave. The full truth
of this last comparison will only become clear to us when, in the
following book, we attempt to fathom the deep significance of
music, and see how a connected, progressive melody, made up of
high, quick notes, may be regarded as in some sense expressing
the life and efforts of man connected by reflection, while the
unconnected complemental notes and the slow bass, which make
up the harmony necessary to perfect the music, represent the rest
of the animal kingdom and the whole of nature that is without
knowledge. 

But of this in its own place, where it will not sound
so paradoxical. We find, however, that the inner necessity of[201]
the gradation of its manifestations, which is inseparable from
the adequate objectification of the will, is expressed by an outer
necessity in the whole of these manifestations themselves, by
reason of which man has need of the beasts for his support, the
beasts in their grades have need of each other as well as of plants,
which in their turn require the ground, water, chemical elements
and their combinations, the planet, the sun, rotation and motion
round the sun, the curve of the ellipse, &c., &c. At bottom this
results from the fact that the will must live on itself, for there

exists nothing beside it, and it is a hungry will. Hence arise eager
pursuit, anxiety, and suffering.

It is only the knowledge of the unity of will as thing-in-itself,
in the endless diversity and multiplicity of the phenomena,
that can afford us the true explanation of that wonderful,
unmistakable analogy of all the productions of nature, that
family likeness on account of which we may regard them as
variations on the same ungiven theme. So in like measure,
through the distinct and thoroughly comprehended knowledge
of that harmony, that essential connection of all the parts of the
world, that necessity of their gradation which we have just been
considering, we shall obtain a true and sufficient insight into
the inner nature and meaning of the undeniable teleology of all
organised productions of nature, which, indeed, we presupposed
a priori, when considering and investigating them.

This teleology is of a twofold description; sometimes an inner
teleology, that is, an agreement of all the parts of a particular
organism, so ordered that the sustenance of the individual and the
species results from it, and therefore presents itself as the end of
that disposition or arrangement. Sometimes, however, there is an
outward teleology, a relation of unorganised to organised nature
in general, or of particular parts of organised nature to each [202]
other, which makes the maintenance of the whole of organised
nature, or of the particular animal species, possible, and therefore
presents itself to our judgment as the means to this end.
Inner teleology is connected with the scheme of our work
in the following way. If, in accordance with what has been
said, all variations of form in nature, and all multiplicity of
individuals, belong not to the will itself, but merely to its
objectivity and the form of this objectivity, it necessarily follows
that the will is indivisible and is present as a whole in every
manifestation, although the grades of its objectification, the
(Platonic) Ideas, are very different from each other. 

We may, for the sake of simplicity, regard these different Ideas as in themselves individual and simple acts of the will, in which it expresses its nature more or less. Individuals, however, are again
manifestations of the Ideas, thus of these acts, in time, space,
and multiplicity. 

Now, in the lowest grades of objectivity, such
an act (or an Idea) retains its unity in the manifestation; while,
in order to appear in higher grades, it requires a whole series
of conditions and developments in time, which only collectively
express its nature completely. 

Thus, for example the Idea that reveals itself in any general force of nature has always one single
expression, although it presents itself differently according to the
external relations that are present: otherwise its identity could
not be proved, for this is done by abstracting the diversity that
arises merely from external relations. In the same way the
crystal has only one manifestation of life, crystallisation, which
afterwards has its fully adequate and exhaustive expression in
the rigid form, the corpse of that momentary life. The plant,
however, does not express the Idea, whose phenomenon it is,
at once and through a single manifestation, but in a succession
of developments of its organs in time. The animal not only
develops its organism in the same manner, in a succession of
forms which are often very different (metamorphosis), but this[203]
form itself, although it is already objectivity of will at this grade,
does not attain to a full expression of its Idea. 

This expression
must be completed through the actions of the animal, in which
its empirical character, common to the whole species, manifests
itself, and only then does it become the full revelation of the
Idea, a revelation which presupposes the particular organism as
its first condition. In the case of man, the empirical character is
peculiar to every individual (indeed, as we shall see in the Fourth
Book, even to the extent of supplanting entirely the character of
the species, through the self-surrender of the whole will). That
which is known as the empirical character, through the necessary
development in time, and the division into particular actions that
is conditioned by it, is, when we abstract from this temporal form
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 215
of the manifestation the intelligible character, according to the
expression of Kant, who shows his undying merit especially in
establishing this distinction and explaining the relation between
freedom and necessity, i.e., between the will as thing-in-itself
and its manifestations in time.38 

Thus the intelligible character
coincides with the Idea, or, more accurately, with the original
act of will which reveals itself in it. So far then, not only the
empirical character of every man, but also that of every species of
animal and plant, and even of every original force of unorganised
nature, is to be regarded as the manifestation of an intelligible
character, that is, of a timeless, indivisible act of will. I should
like here to draw attention in passing to the naïveté with which
every plant expresses and lays open its whole character in its
mere form, reveals its whole being and will. This is why the [204]
physiognomy of plants is so interesting; while in order to know
an animal in its Idea, it is necessary to observe the course of its
action. As for man, he must be fully investigated and tested,
for reason makes him capable of a high degree of dissimulation.
The beast is as much more naïve than the man as the plant is
more naïve than the beast. In the beast we see the will to live
more naked, as it were, than in the man, in whom it is clothed
with so much knowledge, and is, moreover, so veiled through
the capacity for dissimulation, that it is almost only by chance,
and here and there, that its true nature becomes apparent. In the
plant it shows itself quite naked, but also much weaker, as mere
blind striving for existence without end or aim. For the plant
reveals its whole being at the first glance, and with complete
innocence, which does not suffer from the fact that it carries
its organs of generation exposed to view on its upper surface,

the Totality of the Deduction of the Events in the Universe,” pp. 560-586

though in all animals they have been assigned to the most hidden
part. This innocence of the plant results from its complete want
of knowledge. Guilt does not lie in willing, but in willing with
knowledge. Every plant speaks to us first of all of its home, of
the climate, and the nature of the ground in which it has grown.

Therefore, even those who have had little practice easily tell
whether an exotic plant belongs to the tropical or the temperate
zone, and whether it grows in water, in marshes, on mountain,
or on moorland. Besides this, however, every plant expresses
the special will of its species, and says something that cannot
be uttered in any other tongue. But we must now apply what
has been said to the teleological consideration of the organism,
so far as it concerns its inner design. 

If in unorganised nature
the Idea, which is everywhere to be regarded as a single act of
will, reveals itself also in a single manifestation which is always
the same, and thus one may say that here the empirical character
directly partakes of the unity of the intelligible, coincides, as it[205]
were, with it, so that no inner design can show itself here; if, on
the contrary, all organisms express their Ideas through a series
of successive developments, conditioned by a multiplicity of
co-existing parts, and thus only the sum of the manifestations of
the empirical character collectively constitute the expression of
the intelligible character; this necessary co-existence of the parts
and succession of the stages of development does not destroy
the unity of the appearing Idea, the act of will which expresses
itself; nay, rather this unity finds its expression in the necessary
relation and connection of the parts and stages of development
with each other, in accordance with the law of causality. Since
it is the will which is one, indivisible, and therefore entirely
in harmony with itself, that reveals itself in the whole Idea as
in act, its manifestation, although broken up into a number of
different parts and conditions, must yet show this unity again
in the thorough agreement of all of these. This is effected by
a necessary relation and dependence of all the parts upon each
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 217
other, by means of which the unity of the Idea is re-established
in the manifestation. In accordance with this, we now recognise
these different parts and functions of the organism as related
to each other reciprocally as means and end, but the organism
itself as the final end of all.

Consequently, neither the breaking
up of the Idea, which in itself is simple, into the multiplicity of
the parts and conditions of the organism, on the one hand, nor,
on the other hand, the re-establishment of its unity through the
necessary connection of the parts and functions which arises from
the fact that they are the cause and effect, the means and end, of
each other, is peculiar and essential to the appearing will as such,
to the thing-in-itself, but only to its manifestation in space, time,
and causality (mere modes of the principle of sufficient reason,
the form of the phenomenon). They belong to the world as idea, [206]
not to the world as will; they belong to the way in which the will
becomes object, i.e., idea at this grade of its objectivity. Every one
who has grasped the meaning of this discussion—a discussion
which is perhaps somewhat difficult—will now fully understand
the doctrine of Kant, which follows from it, that both the design
of organised and the conformity to law of unorganised nature are
only introduced by our understanding, and therefore both belong
only to the phenomenon, not to the thing-in-itself. The surprise,
which was referred to above, at the infallible constancy of the
conformity to law of unorganised nature, is essentially the same
as the surprise that is excited by design in organised nature; for
in both cases what we wonder at is only the sight of the original
unity of the Idea, which, for the phenomenon, has assumed the
form of multiplicity and diversity.39

As regards the second kind of teleology, according to the
division made above, the outer design, which shows itself, not
in the inner economy of the organisms, but in the support and
assistance they receive from without, both from unorganised

<!-- 39 Cf. “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” at the end of the section on
Comparative Anatomy. -->


nature and from each other; its general explanation is to be found
in the exposition we have just given. For the whole world,
with all its phenomena, is the objectivity of the one indivisible
will, the Idea, which is related to all other Ideas as harmony is
related to the single voice. Therefore that unity of the will must
show itself also in the agreement of all its manifestations. But
we can very much increase the clearness of this insight if we
go somewhat more closely into the manifestations of that outer
teleology and agreement of the different parts of nature with
each other, an inquiry which will also throw some light on the
foregoing exposition. We shall best attain this end by considering
the following analogy.

The character of each individual man, so far as it is thoroughly[207]
individual, and not entirely included in that of the species, may
be regarded as a special Idea, corresponding to a special act of the
objectification of will. This act itself would then be his intelligible
character, and his empirical character would be the manifestation
of it. The empirical character is entirely determined through the
intelligible, which is without ground, i.e., as thing-in-itself is not
subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason (the form of
the phenomenon). The empirical character must in the course
of life afford us the express image of the intelligible, and can
only become what the nature of the latter demands. But this
property extends only to the essential, not to the unessential in
the course of life to which it applies. To this unessential belong
the detailed events and actions which are the material in which
the empirical character shows itself. These are determined by
outward circumstances, which present the motives upon which
the character reacts according to its nature; and as they may
be very different, the outward form of the manifestation of the
empirical character, that is, the definite actual or historical form
of the course of life, will have to accommodate itself to their
influence. Now this form may be very different, although what
is essential to the manifestation, its content, remains the same.

Thus, for example it is immaterial whether a man plays for nuts
or for crowns; but whether a man cheats or plays fairly, that is the
real matter; the latter is determined by the intelligible character,
the former by outward circumstances. As the same theme may be
expressed in a hundred different variations, so the same character
may be expressed in a hundred very different lives. But various
as the outward influence may be, the empirical character which
expresses itself in the course of life must yet, whatever form
it takes, accurately objectify the intelligible character, for the
latter adapts its objectification to the given material of actual
circumstances. 

We have now to assume something analogous
to the influence of outward circumstances upon the life that is [208]
determined in essential matters by the character, if we desire to
understand how the will, in the original act of its objectification,
determines the various Ideas in which it objectifies itself, that
is, the different forms of natural existence of every kind, among
which it distributes its objectification, and which must therefore
necessarily have a relation to each other in the manifestation.
We must assume that between all these manifestations of the
one will there existed a universal and reciprocal adaptation and
accommodation of themselves to each other, by which, however,
as we shall soon see more clearly, all time-determination is
to be excluded, for the Idea lies outside time. In accordance
with this, every manifestation must have adapted itself to the
surroundings into which it entered, and these again must have
adapted themselves to it, although it occupied a much later
position in time; and we see this consensus naturæ everywhere.

Every plant is therefore adapted to its soil and climate, every
animal to its element and the prey that will be its food, and is
also in some way protected, to a certain extent, against its natural
enemy: the eye is adapted to the light and its refrangibility, the
lungs and the blood to the air, the air-bladder of fish to water,
the eye of the seal to the change of the medium in which it must
see, the water-pouch in the stomach of the camel to the drought of the African deserts, the sail of the nautilus to the wind that is to drive its little bark, and so on down to the most special and
astonishing outward adaptations.40 We must abstract however
here from all temporal relations, for these can only concern the
manifestation of the Idea, not the Idea itself. 

Accordingly this
kind of explanation must also be used retrospectively, and we
must not merely admit that every species accommodated itself
to the given environment, but also that this environment itself,
which preceded it in time, had just as much regard for the being
that would some time come into it. For it is one and the[209]
same will that objectifies itself in the whole world; it knows no
time, for this form of the principle of sufficient reason does not
belong to it, nor to its original objectivity, the Ideas, but only
to the way in which these are known by the individuals who
themselves are transitory, i.e., to the manifestation of the Ideas.
Thus, time has no significance for our present examination of the
manner in which the objectification of the will distributes itself
among the Ideas, and the Ideas whose manifestations entered
into the course of time earlier, according to the law of causality,
to which as phenomena they are subject, have no advantage
over those whose manifestation entered later; nay rather, these
last are the completest objectifications of the will, to which the
earlier manifestations must adapt themselves just as much as
they must adapt themselves to the earlier. Thus the course of the
planets, the tendency to the ellipse, the rotation of the earth, the
division of land and sea, the atmosphere, light, warmth, and all
such phenomena, which are in nature what bass is in harmony,
adapted themselves in anticipation of the coming species of
living creatures of which they were to become the supporter
and sustainer. In the same way the ground adapted itself to the
nutrition of plants, plants adapted themselves to the nutrition of
animals, animals to that of other animals, and conversely they
<!-- 40 Cf. “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” the section on Comparative Anatomy. -->

all adapted themselves to the nutrition of the ground. All the
parts of nature correspond to each other, for it is one will that
appears in them all, but the course of time is quite foreign to its
original and only adequate objectification (this expression will
be explained in the following book), the Ideas. Even now, when
the species have only to sustain themselves, no longer to come
into existence, we see here and there some such forethought of
nature extending to the future, and abstracting as it were from
the process of time, a self-adaptation of what is to what is yet [210]
to come. The bird builds the nest for the young which it does
not yet know; the beaver constructs a dam the object of which is
unknown to it; ants, marmots, and bees lay in provision for the
winter they have never experienced; the spider and the ant-lion
make snares, as if with deliberate cunning, for future unknown
prey; insects deposit their eggs where the coming brood finds
future nourishment. In the spring-time the female flower of the
diœcian valisneria unwinds the spirals of its stalk, by which till
now it was held at the bottom of the water, and thus rises to the
surface. Just then the male flower, which grows on a short stalk
from the bottom, breaks away, and so, at the sacrifice of its life,
reaches the surface, where it swims about in search of the female.
The latter is fructified, and then draws itself down again to the
bottom by contracting its spirals, and there the fruit grows.41 I
must again refer here to the larva of the male stag-beetle, which
makes the hole in the wood for its metamorphosis as big again
as the female does, in order to have room for its future horns.
The instinct of animals in general gives us the best illustration of
what remains of teleology in nature. For as instinct is an action,
like that which is guided by the conception of an end, and yet
is entirely without this; so all construction of nature resembles
that which is guided by the conception of an end, and yet is
entirely without it. For in the outer as in the inner teleology of

<!-- 41 Chatin, Sur la Valisneria Spiralis, in the Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. de Sc.,
No. 13, 1855. -->

nature, what we are obliged to think as means and end is, in every
case, the manifestation of the unity of the one will so thoroughly
agreeing with itself, which has assumed multiplicity in space and
time for our manner of knowing.

The reciprocal adaptation and self-accommodation of
phenomena that springs from this unity cannot, however, annul
the inner contradiction which appears in the universal conflict of
nature described above, and which is essential to the will. That[211]
harmony goes only so far as to render possible the duration of the
world and the different kinds of existences in it, which without
it would long since have perished. Therefore it only extends
to the continuance of the species, and the general conditions of
life, but not to that of the individual. If, then, by reason of that
harmony and accommodation, the species in organised nature
and the universal forces in unorganised nature continue to exist
beside each other, and indeed support each other reciprocally,
on the other hand, the inner contradiction of the will which
objectifies itself in all these ideas shows itself in the ceaseless
internecine war of the individuals of these species, and in the
constant struggle of the manifestations of these natural forces
with each other, as we pointed out above. The scene and the
object of this conflict is matter, which they try to wrest from
each other, and also space and time, the combination of which
through the form of causality is, in fact, matter, as was explained
in the First Book.42
