<!-- I here conclude the second principal division of my exposition, in the hope that, so far as is possible in the case of
an entirely new thought, which cannot be quite free from traces
of the individuality in which it originated, I have succeeded in
conveying to the reader the complete certainty that this world in
which we live and have our being is in its whole nature through
and through will, and at the same time through and through idea: -->

<!-- 42 Cf. Chaps. xxvi. and xxvii. of the Supplement. -->

This idea, as such, already presupposes a form, object and
subject, is therefore relative; and if we ask what remains if we
take away this form, and all those forms which are subordinate
to it, and which express the principle of sufficient reason, the
answer must be that as something toto genere different from
idea, this can be nothing but will, which is thus properly the
thing-in-itself. 

Every one finds that he himself is this will, in
which the real nature of the world consists, and he also finds [212]
that he is the knowing subject, whose idea the whole world is,
the world which exists only in relation to his consciousness, as
its necessary supporter. Every one is thus himself in a double
aspect the whole world, the microcosm; finds both sides whole
and complete in himself. And what he thus recognises as his
own real being also exhausts the being of the whole world—the
macrocosm; thus the world, like man, is through and through will,
and through and through idea, and nothing more than this. So we
see the philosophy of Thales, which concerned the macrocosm,
unite at this point with that of Socrates, which dealt with the
microcosm, for the object of both is found to be the same. But
all the knowledge that has been communicated in the two first
books will gain greater completeness, and consequently greater
certainty, from the two following books, in which I hope that
several questions that have more or less distinctly arisen in the
course of our work will also be sufficiently answered.

In the meantime one such question may be more particularly
considered, for it can only properly arise so long as one has not
fully penetrated the meaning of the foregoing exposition, and
may so far serve as an illustration of it. It is this: Every will is
a will towards something, has an object, an end of its willing;
what then is the final end, or towards what is that will striving
that is exhibited to us as the being-in-itself of the world? This
question rests, like so many others, upon the confusion of the
thing-in-itself with the manifestation. 

The principle of sufficient
reason, of which the law of motivation is also a form, extends only to the latter, not to the former. It is only of phenomena,
of individual things, that a ground can be given, never of the
will itself, nor of the Idea in which it adequately objectifies
itself. So then of every particular movement or change of any
kind in nature, a cause is to be sought, that is, a condition that
of necessity produced it, but never of the natural force itself which is revealed in this and innumerable similar phenomena;
and it is therefore simple misunderstanding, arising from want of
consideration, to ask for a cause of gravity, electricity, and so on.
Only if one had somehow shown that gravity and electricity were
not original special forces of nature, but only the manifestations
of a more general force already known, would it be allowable to
ask for the cause which made this force produce the phenomena
of gravity or of electricity here. All this has been explained at
length above. In the same way every particular act of will of a
knowing individual (which is itself only a manifestation of will
as the thing-in-itself) has necessarily a motive without which
that act would never have occurred; but just as material causes
contain merely the determination that at this time, in this place,
and in this matter, a manifestation of this or that natural force
must take place, so the motive determines only the act of will
of a knowing being, at this time, in this place, and under these
circumstances, as a particular act, but by no means determines
that that being wills in general or wills in this manner; this is the
expression of his intelligible character, which, as will itself, the
thing-in-itself, is without ground, for it lies outside the province
of the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore every man has
permanent aims and motives by which he guides his conduct, and
he can always give an account of his particular actions; but if he
were asked why he wills at all, or why in general he wills to exist,
he would have no answer, and the question would indeed seem
to him meaningless; and this would be just the expression of his
consciousness that he himself is nothing but will, whose willing
stands by itself and requires more particular determination by motives only in its individual acts at each point of time.
