In fact, freedom from all aim, from all limits, belongs to the nature of the will, which is an endless striving. This was already touched on above in the reference to centrifugal force. It also discloses itself in its simplest form in the lowest grade of the objectification of will, in gravitation, which we see constantly exerting itself, though a final goal is obviously impossible for it.

For if, according to its will, all existing matter were collected in
one mass, yet within this mass gravity, ever striving towards the
centre, would still wage war with impenetrability as rigidity or
elasticity. The tendency of matter can therefore only be confined,
never completed or appeased. But this is precisely the case with
all tendencies of all phenomena of will. Every attained end is
also the beginning of a new course, and so on ad infinitum. The
plant raises its manifestation from the seed through the stem
and the leaf to the blossom and the fruit, which again is the
beginning of a new seed, a new individual, that runs through
the old course, and so on through endless time. Such also is
the life of the animal; procreation is its highest point, and after
attaining to it, the life of the first individual quickly or slowly
sinks, while a new life ensures to nature the endurance of the
species and repeats the same phenomena. Indeed, the constant
renewal of the matter of every organism is also to be regarded as
merely the manifestation of this continual pressure and change,
and physiologists are now ceasing to hold that it is the necessary
reparation of the matter wasted in motion, for the possible
wearing out of the machine can by no means be equivalent to the
support it is constantly receiving through nourishment. Eternal
becoming, endless flux, characterises the revelation of the inner
nature of will. Finally, the same thing shows itself in human
endeavours and desires, which always delude us by presenting
their satisfaction as the final end of will. 

As soon as we attain
to them they no longer appear the same, and therefore they soon
grow stale, are forgotten, and though not openly disowned, are yet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are fortunate
enough if there still remains something to wish for and to strive after, that the game may be kept up of constant transition from
desire to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new desire, the
rapid course of which is called happiness, and the slow course
sorrow, and does not sink into that stagnation that shows itself in
fearful ennui that paralyses life, vain yearning without a definite
object, deadening languor. 

According to all this, when the will
is enlightened by knowledge, it always knows what it wills now
and here, never what it wills in general; every particular act of
will has its end, the whole will has none; just as every particular
phenomenon of nature is determined by a sufficient cause so
far as concerns its appearance in this place at this time, but the
force which manifests itself in it has no general cause, for it
belongs to the thing-in-itself, to the groundless will. The single
example of self-knowledge of the will as a whole is the idea as
a whole, the whole world of perception. It is the objectification,
the revelation, the mirror of the will. What the will expresses in
it will be the subject of our further consideration.43

§ 30. Book 1 explained the world as mere idea, object for a subject.

In Book 2, I considered it from its other side.

I found that in this aspect it is will, which proved to be simply that which this world is besides being idea. 

In accordance with this knowledge we called the world as idea, both as a whole and in its parts, the objectification of will, which therefore means the will become object, i.e., idea. 

Further, we remember that this objectification of will was found to have many definite grades, in which, with gradually increasing distinctness and completeness, the nature of will appears in the idea, that is to say, presents itself as object. 

In these grades we already recognised the Platonic Ideas, for the grades are just the determined species, or the original unchanging forms and qualities of all natural bodies, both organised and unorganised, and also the general forces which reveal themselves according to natural laws. 

These Ideas, then, as a whole express themselves in innumerable individuals and particulars, and are related to these as archetypes to their copies. 

The multiplicity of such individuals is only conceivable through time and space, their appearing and passing away through causality, and in all these forms we recognise merely the different modes of the principle of sufficient reason, which is the ultimate principle of all that is finite, of all individual existence, and the universal form of the idea as it appears in the knowledge of the individual as such. 

The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, does not come under this principle, and has therefore neither multiplicity nor change. While the individuals in which it expresses itself are innumerable, and unceasingly come into being and pass away, it remains unchanged as one and the same, and the principle of sufficient reason has for it no meaning. 

As, however, this is the form under which all knowledge of the subject comes, so far as the subject knows as an individual, the Ideas lie quite outside the sphere of its knowledge. If, therefore, the Ideas are to become objects of knowledge, this can only happen by transcending the individuality of the knowing subject. The more exact and detailed explanation of this is what will now occupy our attention.
