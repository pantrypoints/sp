In order to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the world, we should distinguish the will:
- as thing-in-itself from its adequate objectivity.
- from the different grades in which this appears more and more distinctly and fully, i.e., the Ideas themselves, from the merely phenomenal existence of these Ideas in the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, the restricted method of knowledge of the individual. 

We shall then agree with Plato when he attributes[235] actual being only to the Ideas, and allows only an illusive, dream- like existence to things in space and time, the real world for the individual. Then we shall understand how one and the same Idea reveals itself in so many phenomena, and presents its nature only bit by bit to the individual, one side after another.

Then we shall also distinguish the Idea itself from the way in which its manifestation appears in the observation of the individual, and
recognise the former as essential and the latter as unessential.
Let us consider this with the help of examples taken from the
most insignificant things, and also from the greatest. 

When the
clouds move, the figures which they form are not essential, but
indifferent to them; but that as elastic vapour they are pressed together, drifted along, spread out, or torn asunder by the force
of the wind: this is their nature, the essence of the forces which
objectify themselves in them, the Idea; their actual forms are
only for the individual observer. To the brook that flows over
stones, the eddies, the waves, the foam-flakes which it forms
are indifferent and unessential; but that it follows the attraction
of gravity, and behaves as inelastic, perfectly mobile, formless,
transparent fluid: this is its nature; this, if known through
perception, is its Idea; these accidental forms are only for us so
long as we know as individuals. 

The ice on the window-pane
forms itself into crystals according to the laws of crystallisation,
which reveal the essence of the force of nature that appears here,
exhibit the Idea; but the trees and flowers which it traces on the
pane are unessential, and are only there for us. What appears
in the clouds, the brook, and the crystal is the weakest echo of
that will which appears more fully in the plant, more fully still
in the beast, and most fully in man. But only the essential in
all these grades of its objectification constitutes the Idea; on the
other hand, its unfolding or development, because broken up in
the forms of the principle of sufficient reason into a multiplicity
of many-sided phenomena, is unessential to the Idea, lies merely [236]
in the kind of knowledge that belongs to the individual and has
reality only for this. The same thing necessarily holds good of
the unfolding of that Idea which is the completest objectivity of
will. Therefore, the history of the human race, the throng of
events, the change of times, the multifarious forms of human life
in different lands and countries, all this is only the accidental
form of the manifestation of the Idea, does not belong to the Idea
itself, in which alone lies the adequate objectivity of the will, but
only to the phenomenon which appears in the knowledge of the
individual, and is just as foreign, unessential, and indifferent to
the Idea itself as the figures which they assume are to the clouds,
the form of its eddies and foam-flakes to the brook, or its trees
and flowers to the ice.

To him who has thoroughly grasped this, and can distinguish
between the will and the Idea, and between the Idea and its
manifestation, the events of the world will have significance
only so far as they are the letters out of which we may read the
Idea of man, but not in and for themselves. He will not believe
with the vulgar that time may produce something actually new
and significant; that through it, or in it, something absolutely
real may attain to existence, or indeed that it itself as a whole
has beginning and end, plan and development, and in some way
has for its final aim the highest perfection (according to their
conception) of the last generation of man, whose life is a brief
thirty years. Therefore he will just as little, with Homer, people
a whole Olympus with gods to guide the events of time, as,
with Ossian, he will take the forms of the clouds for individual
beings; for, as we have said, both have just as much meaning
as regards the Idea which appears in them. In the manifold
forms of human life and in the unceasing change of events, he
will regard the Idea only as the abiding and essential, in which
the will to live has its fullest objectivity, and which shows its[237]
different sides in the capacities, the passions, the errors and the
excellences of the human race; in self-interest, hatred, love, fear,
boldness, frivolity, stupidity, slyness, wit, genius, and so forth,
all of which crowding together and combining in thousands of
forms (individuals), continually create the history of the great
and the little world, in which it is all the same whether they are
set in motion by nuts or by crowns. 

Finally, he will find that
in the world it is the same as in the dramas of Gozzi, in all of
which the same persons appear, with like intention, and with
a like fate; the motives and incidents are certainly different in
each piece, but the spirit of the incidents is the same; the actors
in one piece know nothing of the incidents of another, although
they performed in it themselves; therefore, after all experience of
former pieces, Pantaloon has become no more agile or generous,
Tartaglia no more conscientious, Brighella no more courageous, and Columbine no more modest.
Suppose we were allowed for once a clearer glance into the
kingdom of the possible, and over the whole chain of causes and
effects; if the earth-spirit appeared and showed us in a picture
all the greatest men, enlighteners of the world, and heroes, that
chance destroyed before they were ripe for their work; then the
great events that would have changed the history of the world
and brought in periods of the highest culture and enlightenment,
but which the blindest chance, the most insignificant accident,
hindered at the outset; lastly, the splendid powers of great men,
that would have enriched whole ages of the world, but which,
either misled by error or passion, or compelled by necessity,
they squandered uselessly on unworthy or unfruitful objects, or
even wasted in play. If we saw all this, we would shudder
and lament at the thought of the lost treasures of whole periods
of the world. But the earth-spirit would smile and say, “The
source from which the individuals and their powers proceed is [238]
inexhaustible and unending as time and space; for, like these
forms of all phenomena, they also are only phenomena, visibility
of the will. No finite measure can exhaust that infinite source;
therefore an undiminished eternity is always open for the return
of any event or work that was nipped in the bud. In this world
of phenomena true loss is just as little possible as true gain. The
will alone is; it is the thing in-itself, and the source of all these
phenomena. Its self-knowledge and its assertion or denial, which
is then decided upon, is the only event in-itself.”
