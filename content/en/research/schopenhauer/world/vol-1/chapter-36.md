History follows the thread of events.

It is pragmatic so far as it deduces them in accordance with the law of motivation, a law that determines the self-manifesting will wherever it is enlightened by knowledge.


<!-- 49 This last sentence cannot be understood without some acquaintance with
the next book. -->

At the lowest grades of its objectivity, where it still acts without knowledge, natural science, in the form of etiology, treats of the laws of the changes of its phenomena, and, in the form of morphology, of what is permanent in them.
This almost endless task is lightened by the aid of concepts, which
comprehend what is general in order that we may deduce what is
particular from it. Lastly, mathematics treats of the mere forms,
time and space, in which the Ideas, broken up into multiplicity,
appear for the knowledge of the subject as individual. 

All these, of which the common name is science, proceed according to
the principle of sufficient reason in its different forms, and their
theme is always the phenomenon, its laws, connections, and the
relations which result from them. But what kind of knowledge
is concerned with that which is outside and independent of all
relations, that which alone is really essential to the world, the
true content of its phenomena, that which is subject to no change,
and therefore is known with equal truth for all time, in a word,
the Ideas, which are the direct and adequate objectivity of the thing in-itself, the will? We answer, Art, the work of genius.

It repeats or reproduces the eternal Ideas grasped through pure
contemplation, the essential and abiding in all the phenomena
of the world; and according to what the material is in which it
reproduces, it is sculpture or painting, poetry or music. 

Its one
source is the knowledge of Ideas; its one aim the communication
of this knowledge. While science, following the unresting and
inconstant stream of the fourfold forms of reason and consequent,
with each end attained sees further, and can never reach a final
goal nor attain full satisfaction, any more than by running we can
reach the place where the clouds touch the horizon; art, on the
contrary, is everywhere at its goal. For it plucks the object of its
contemplation out of the stream of the world's course, and has it
isolated before it. And this particular thing, which in that stream
was a small perishing part, becomes to art the representative of
the whole, an equivalent of the endless multitude in space and
time. 

It therefore pauses at this particular thing; the course of
time stops; the relations vanish for it; only the essential, the
Idea, is its object. We may, therefore, accurately define it as the way of viewing things independent of the principle of sufficient
reason, in opposition to the way of viewing them which proceeds
in accordance with that principle, and which is the method of
experience and of science. This last method of considering things
may be compared to a line infinitely extended in a horizontal
direction, and the former to a vertical line which cuts it at
any point. The method of viewing things which proceeds in
accordance with the principle of sufficient reason is the rational
method, and it alone is valid and of use in practical life and in
science. 

The method which looks away from the content of this
principle is the method of genius, which is only valid and of use
in art. The first is the method of Aristotle; the second is, on the
whole, that of Plato. The first is like the mighty storm, that rushes [240]
along without beginning and without aim, bending, agitating, and
carrying away everything before it; the second is like the silent
sunbeam, that pierces through the storm quite unaffected by
it. 

The first is like the innumerable showering drops of the
waterfall, which, constantly changing, never rest for an instant;
the second is like the rainbow, quietly resting on this raging
torrent. Only through the pure contemplation described above,
which ends entirely in the object, can Ideas be comprehended;
and the nature of genius consists in pre-eminent capacity for such
contemplation. Now, as this requires that a man should entirely
forget himself and the relations in which he stands, genius is
simply the completest objectivity, i.e., the objective tendency of
the mind, as opposed to the subjective, which is directed to one's
own self—in other words, to the will. Thus genius is the faculty
of continuing in the state of pure perception, of losing oneself in
perception, and of enlisting in this service the knowledge which
originally existed only for the service of the will; that is to say,
genius is the power of leaving one's own interests, wishes, and
aims entirely out of sight, thus of entirely renouncing one's own
personality for a time, so as to remain pure knowing subject,
clear vision of the world; and this not merely at moments, but for a sufficient length of time, and with sufficient consciousness,
to enable one to reproduce by deliberate art what has thus been
apprehended, and “to fix in lasting thoughts the wavering images
that float before the mind.” It is as if, when genius appears in
an individual, a far larger measure of the power of knowledge
falls to his lot than is necessary for the service of an individual
will; and this superfluity of knowledge, being free, now becomes
subject purified from will, a clear mirror of the inner nature
of the world. This explains the activity, amounting even to
disquietude, of men of genius, for the present can seldom satisfy
them, because it does not fill their consciousness. This gives[241]
them that restless aspiration, that unceasing desire for new things,
and for the contemplation of lofty things, and also that longing
that is hardly ever satisfied, for men of similar nature and of like
stature, to whom they might communicate themselves; whilst
the common mortal, entirely filled and satisfied by the common
present, ends in it, and finding everywhere his like, enjoys that
peculiar satisfaction in daily life that is denied to genius.

Imagination has rightly been recognised as an essential
element of genius; it has sometimes even been regarded as
identical with it; but this is a mistake. As the objects of genius
are the eternal Ideas, the permanent, essential forms of the
world and all its phenomena, and as the knowledge of the Idea
is necessarily knowledge through perception, is not abstract,
the knowledge of the genius would be limited to the Ideas of
the objects actually present to his person, and dependent upon
the chain of circumstances that brought these objects to him,
if his imagination did not extend his horizon far beyond the
limits of his actual personal existence, and thus enable him to
construct the whole out of the little that comes into his own
actual apperception, and so to let almost all possible scenes of
life pass before him in his own consciousness. Further, the
actual objects are almost always very imperfect copies of the
Ideas expressed in them; therefore the man of genius requires imagination in order to see in things, not that which Nature has
actually made, but that which she endeavoured to make, yet
could not because of that conflict of her forms among themselves
which we referred to in the last book. We shall return to this
farther on in treating of sculpture. 

The imagination then extends
the intellectual horizon of the man of genius beyond the objects
which actually present themselves to him, both as regards quality
and quantity. Therefore extraordinary strength of imagination
accompanies, and is indeed a necessary condition of genius. But
the converse does not hold, for strength of imagination does not [242]
indicate genius; on the contrary, men who have no touch of genius
may have much imagination. 

For as it is possible to consider
a real object in two opposite ways, purely objectively, the way
of genius grasping its Idea, or in the common way, merely in
the relations in which it stands to other objects and to one's own
will, in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, it is
also possible to perceive an imaginary object in both of these
ways. Regarded in the first way, it is a means to the knowledge
of the Idea, the communication of which is the work of art; in the
second case, the imaginary object is used to build castles in the
air congenial to egotism and the individual humour, and which
for the moment delude and gratify; thus only the relations of the
phantasies so linked together are known. The man who indulges
in such an amusement is a dreamer; he will easily mingle those
fancies that delight his solitude with reality, and so unfit himself
for real life: perhaps he will write them down, and then we shall
have the ordinary novel of every description, which entertains
those who are like him and the public at large, for the readers
imagine themselves in the place of the hero, and then find the
story very agreeable.

The common mortal, that manufacture of Nature which she
produces by the thousand every day, is, as we have said, not
capable, at least not continuously so, of observation that in every
sense is wholly disinterested, as sensuous contemplation, strictly so called, is. He can turn his attention to things only so far
as they have some relation to his will, however indirect it may
be. Since in this respect, which never demands anything but
the knowledge of relations, the abstract conception of the thing
is sufficient, and for the most part even better adapted for use;
the ordinary man does not linger long over the mere perception,
does not fix his attention long on one object, but in all that is
presented to him hastily seeks merely the concept under which
it is to be brought, as the lazy man seeks a chair, and then it[243]
interests him no further. This is why he is so soon done with
everything, with works of art, objects of natural beauty, and
indeed everywhere with the truly significant contemplation of all
the scenes of life. He does not linger; only seeks to know his
own way in life, together with all that might at any time become
his way. Thus he makes topographical notes in the widest sense;
over the consideration of life itself as such he wastes no time.
The man of genius, on the other hand, whose excessive power
of knowledge frees it at times from the service of will, dwells
on the consideration of life itself, strives to comprehend the Idea
of each thing, not its relations to other things; and in doing this
he often forgets to consider his own path in life, and therefore
for the most part pursues it awkwardly enough. While to the
ordinary man his faculty of knowledge is a lamp to lighten his
path, to the man of genius it is the sun which reveals the world.
This great diversity in their way of looking at life soon becomes
visible in the outward appearance both of the man of genius and
of the ordinary mortal. The man in whom genius lives and works
is easily distinguished by his glance, which is both keen and
steady, and bears the stamp of perception, of contemplation. This
is easily seen from the likenesses of the few men of genius whom
Nature has produced here and there among countless millions.
On the other hand, in the case of an ordinary man, the true object
of his contemplation, what he is prying into, can be easily seen
from his glance, if indeed it is not quite stupid and vacant, as is generally the case. Therefore the expression of genius in a face
consists in this, that in it a decided predominance of knowledge
over will is visible, and consequently there also shows itself in
it a knowledge that is entirely devoid of relation to will, i.e.,
pure knowing. On the contrary, in ordinary countenances there
is a predominant expression of will; and we see that knowledge
only comes into activity under the impulse of will, and thus is [244]
directed merely by motives.

Since the knowledge that pertains to genius, or the knowledge
of Ideas, is that knowledge which does not follow the principle
of sufficient reason, so, on the other hand, the knowledge
which does follow that principle is that which gives us prudence
and rationality in life, and which creates the sciences. Thus
men of genius are affected with the deficiencies entailed in
the neglect of this latter kind of knowledge. Yet what I say
in this regard is subject to the limitation that it only concerns
them in so far as and while they are actually engaged in that
kind of knowledge which is peculiar to genius; and this is by
no means at every moment of their lives, for the great though
spontaneous exertion which is demanded for the comprehension
of Ideas free from will must necessarily relax, and there are
long intervals during which men of genius are placed in very
much the same position as ordinary mortals, both as regards
advantages and deficiencies. On this account the action of
genius has always been regarded as an inspiration, as indeed
the name indicates, as the action of a superhuman being distinct
from the individual himself, and which takes possession of him
only periodically. The disinclination of men of genius to direct
their attention to the content of the principle of sufficient reason
will first show itself, with regard to the ground of being, as
dislike of mathematics; for its procedure is based upon the most
universal forms of the phenomenon space and time, which are
themselves merely modes of the principle of sufficient reason,
and is consequently precisely the opposite of that method of thought which seeks merely the content of the phenomenon, the
Idea which expresses itself in it apart from all relations. 

The
logical method of mathematics is also antagonistic to genius, for
it does not satisfy but obstructs true insight, and presents merely
a chain of conclusions in accordance with the principle of the[245]
ground of knowing. The mental faculty upon which it makes
the greatest claim is memory, for it is necessary to recollect all
the earlier propositions which are referred to. Experience has
also proved that men of great artistic genius have no faculty
for mathematics; no man was ever very distinguished for both.
Alfieri relates that he was never able to understand the fourth
proposition of Euclid. Goethe was constantly reproached with his
want of mathematical knowledge by the ignorant opponents of
his theory of colours. Here certainly, where it was not a question
of calculation and measurement upon hypothetical data, but of
direct knowledge by the understanding of causes and effects, this
reproach was so utterly absurd and inappropriate, that by making
it they have exposed their entire want of judgment, just as much
as by the rest of their ridiculous arguments. The fact that up
to the present day, nearly half a century after the appearance
of Goethe's theory of colours, even in Germany the Newtonian
fallacies still have undisturbed possession of the professorial
chair, and men continue to speak quite seriously of the seven
homogeneous rays of light and their different refrangibility, will
some day be numbered among the great intellectual peculiarities
of men generally, and especially of Germans. From the same
cause as we have referred to above, may be explained the equally
well-known fact that, conversely, admirable mathematicians
have very little susceptibility for works of fine art. This is very
naïvely expressed in the well-known anecdote of the French
mathematician, who, after having read Racine's “Iphigenia,”
shrugged his shoulders and asked, “Qu'est ce que cela prouve?”
Further, as quick comprehension of relations in accordance with
the laws of causality and motivation is what specially constitutes
253
prudence or sagacity, a prudent man, so far as and while he is
so, will not be a genius, and a man of genius, so far as and
while he is so, will not be a prudent man. Lastly, perceptive
knowledge generally, in the province of which the Idea always [246]
lies, is directly opposed to rational or abstract knowledge, which
is guided by the principle of the ground of knowing. It is
also well known that we seldom find great genius united with
pre-eminent reasonableness; on the contrary, persons of genius
are often subject to violent emotions and irrational passions.
But the ground of this is not weakness of reason, but partly
unwonted energy of that whole phenomenon of will—the man of
genius—which expresses itself through the violence of all his acts
of will, and partly preponderance of the knowledge of perception
through the senses and understanding over abstract knowledge,
producing a decided tendency to the perceptible, the exceedingly
lively impressions of which so far outshine colourless concepts,
that they take their place in the guidance of action, which
consequently becomes irrational. Accordingly the impression
of the present moment is very strong with such persons, and
carries them away into unconsidered action, violent emotions
and passions. Moreover, since, in general, the knowledge of
persons of genius has to some extent freed itself from the service
of will, they will not in conversation think so much of the person
they are addressing as of the thing they are speaking about,
which is vividly present to them; and therefore they are likely
to judge or narrate things too objectively for their own interests;
they will not pass over in silence what would more prudently be
concealed, and so forth. Finally, they are given to soliloquising,
and in general may exhibit certain weaknesses which are actually
akin to madness. It has often been remarked that there is a
side at which genius and madness touch, and even pass over
into each other, and indeed poetical inspiration has been called
a kind of madness: amabilis insania, Horace calls it (Od. iii.
4), and Wieland in the introduction to “Oberon” speaks of it as
254 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
“amiable madness.” Even Aristotle, as quoted by Seneca (De
Tranq. Animi, 15, 16), is reported to have said: Nullum magnum[247]
ingenium sine mixtura dementiæ fuit. Plato expresses it in the
figure of the dark cave, referred to above (De Rep. 7), when he
says: “Those who, outside the cave, have seen the true sunlight
and the things that have true being (Ideas), cannot afterwards see
properly down in the cave, because their eyes are not accustomed
to the darkness; they cannot distinguish the shadows, and are
jeered at for their mistakes by those who have never left the cave
and its shadows.” In the “Phædrus” also (p. 317), he distinctly
says that there can be no true poet without a certain madness; in
fact, (p. 327), that every one appears mad who recognises the
eternal Ideas in fleeting things. Cicero also quotes: Negat enim
sine furore, Democritus, quemquam poetam magnum esse posse;
quod idem dicit Plato (De Divin., i. 37). And, lastly, Pope says—
“Great wits to madness sure are near allied,
And thin partitions do their bounds divide.”
Especially instructive in this respect is Goethe's “Torquato
Tasso,” in which he shows us not only the suffering, the
martyrdom of genius as such, but also how it constantly passes
into madness. Finally, the fact of the direct connection of
genius and madness is established by the biographies of great
men of genius, such as Rousseau, Byron, and Alfieri, and by
anecdotes from the lives of others. On the other hand, I must
mention that, by a diligent search in lunatic asylums, I have found
individual cases of patients who were unquestionably endowed
with great talents, and whose genius distinctly appeared through
their madness, which, however, had completely gained the upper
hand. Now this cannot be ascribed to chance, for on the one
hand the number of mad persons is relatively very small, and on
the other hand a person of genius is a phenomenon which is rare
beyond all ordinary estimation, and only appears in nature as the greatest exception. It will be sufficient to convince us of this if we
compare the number of really great men of genius that the whole of civilised Europe has produced, both in ancient and modern
times, with the two hundred and fifty millions who are always
living in Europe, and who change entirely every thirty years. 

In estimating the number of men of outstanding genius, we must of
course only count those who have produced works which have
retained through all time an enduring value for mankind. I shall
not refrain from mentioning, that I have known some persons
of decided, though not remarkable, mental superiority, who also
showed a slight trace of insanity. It might seem from this that
every advance of intellect beyond the ordinary measure, as an
abnormal development, disposes to madness. In the meantime,
however, I will explain as briefly as possible my view of the
purely intellectual ground of the relation between genius and
madness, for this will certainly assist the explanation of the real
nature of genius, that is to say, of that mental endowment which
alone can produce genuine works of art. But this necessitates a
brief explanation of madness itself.

A clear and complete insight into the nature of madness, a
correct and distinct conception of what constitutes the difference
between the sane and the insane, has, as far as I know, not as
yet been found. Neither reason nor understanding can be denied
to madmen, for they talk and understand, and often draw very
accurate conclusions; they also, as a rule, perceive what is present
quite correctly, and apprehend the connection between cause and
effect. Visions, like the phantasies of delirium, are no ordinary
symptom of madness: delirium falsifies perception, madness the
thoughts. For the most part, madmen do not err in the knowledge
of what is immediately present; their raving always relates to
what is absent and past, and only through these to their connection
with what is present. Therefore it seems to me that their malady [249]

<!-- 50 Cf. Chap. xxxi. of the Supplement. -->

specially concerns the memory; not indeed that memory fails
them entirely, for many of them know a great deal by heart,
and sometimes recognise persons whom they have not seen for
a long time; but rather that the thread of memory is broken,
the continuity of its connection destroyed, and no uniformly
connected recollection of the past is possible. Particular scenes
of the past are known correctly, just like the particular present; but
there are gaps in their recollection which they fill up with fictions,
and these are either always the same, in which case they become
fixed ideas, and the madness that results is called monomania
or melancholy; or they are always different, momentary fancies,
and then it is called folly, fatuitas. This is why it is so difficult
to find out their former life from lunatics when they enter an
asylum. The true and the false are always mixed up in their
memory. Although the immediate present is correctly known,
it becomes falsified through its fictitious connection with an
imaginary past; they therefore regard themselves and others as
identical with persons who exist only in their imaginary past;
they do not recognise some of their acquaintances at all, and
thus while they perceive correctly what is actually present, they
have only false conceptions of its relations to what is absent. If
the madness reaches a high degree, there is complete absence of
memory, so that the madman is quite incapable of any reference
to what is absent or past, and is only determined by the caprice of
the moment in connection with the fictions which, in his mind,
fill the past. In such a case, we are never for a moment safe
from violence or murder, unless we constantly make the madman
aware of the presence of superior force. The knowledge of the
madman has this in common with that of the brute, both are
confined to the present. What distinguishes them is that the brute
has really no idea of the past as such, though the past acts upon
it through the medium of custom, so that, for example, the dog
recognises its former master even after years, that is to say, it 
receives the wonted impression at the sight of him; but of the time that has passed since it saw him it has no recollection. 

The
madman, on the other hand, always carries about in his reason
an abstract past, but it is a false past, which exists only for him,
and that either constantly, or only for the moment. The influence
of this false past prevents the use of the true knowledge of the
present which the brute is able to make. The fact that violent
mental suffering or unexpected and terrible calamities should
often produce madness, I explain in the following manner. 

All
such suffering is as an actual event confined to the present. It
is thus merely transitory, and is consequently never excessively
heavy; it only becomes unendurably great when it is lasting
pain; but as such it exists only in thought, and therefore lies in
the memory. If now such a sorrow, such painful knowledge or
reflection, is so bitter that it becomes altogether unbearable, and
the individual is prostrated under it, then, terrified Nature seizes
upon madness as the last resource of life; the mind so fearfully
tortured at once destroys the thread of its memory, fills up the
gaps with fictions, and thus seeks refuge in madness from the
mental suffering that exceeds its strength, just as we cut off a
mortified limb and replace it with a wooden one. The distracted
Ajax, King Lear, and Ophelia may be taken as examples; for
the creations of true genius, to which alone we can refer here,
as universally known, are equal in truth to real persons; besides,
in this case, frequent actual experience shows the same thing.
A faint analogy of this kind of transition from pain to madness
is to be found in the way in which all of us often seek, as it
were mechanically, to drive away a painful thought that suddenly
occurs to us by some loud exclamation or quick movement—to
turn ourselves from it, to distract our minds by force.
We see, from what has been said, that the madman has a [251]
true knowledge of what is actually present, and also of certain
particulars of the past, but that he mistakes the connection, the
relations, and therefore falls into error and talks nonsense. 

This is exactly the point at which he comes into contact with the man of genius; for he also leaves out of sight the knowledge of
the connection of things, since he neglects that knowledge of
relations which conforms to the principle of sufficient reason, in
order to see in things only their Ideas, and to seek to comprehend
their true nature, which manifests itself to perception, and in
regard to which one thing represents its whole species, in which
way, as Goethe says, one case is valid for a thousand. The
particular object of his contemplation, or the present which is
perceived by him with extraordinary vividness, appear in so
strong a light that the other links of the chain to which they
belong are at once thrown into the shade, and this gives rise
to phenomena which have long been recognised as resembling
those of madness. That which in particular given things exists
only incompletely and weakened by modifications, is raised by
the man of genius, through his way of contemplating it, to the
Idea of the thing, to completeness: he therefore sees everywhere
extremes, and therefore his own action tends to extremes; he
cannot hit the mean, he lacks soberness, and the result is what we
have said. He knows the Ideas completely but not the individuals.
Therefore it has been said that a poet may know mankind deeply
and thoroughly, and may yet have a very imperfect knowledge
of men. He is easily deceived, and is a tool in the hands of the
crafty.
