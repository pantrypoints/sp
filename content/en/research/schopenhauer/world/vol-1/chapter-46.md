Laocoon, in the celebrated group, does not cry out.

The universal and ever-renewed surprise at this must be occasioned by the fact that any of us would cry out if we
were in his place. And nature demands that it should be so; for in
the case of the acutest physical pain, and the sudden seizure by
the greatest bodily fear, all reflection, that might have inculcated
silent endurance, is entirely expelled from consciousness, and
nature relieves itself by crying out, thus expressing both the pain
and the fear, summoning the deliverer and terrifying the assailer.
Thus Winckelmann missed the expression of crying out; but as
he wished to justify the artist he turned Laocoon into a Stoic, who
considered it beneath his dignity to cry out secundum naturam, [293]
but added to his pain the useless constraint of suppressing all
utterance of it. Winckelmann therefore sees in him “the tried
spirit of a great man, who writhes in agony, and yet seeks to
suppress the utterance of his feeling, and to lock it up in himself.
He does not break forth into loud cries, as in Virgil, but only
anxious sighs escape him,” &c. (Works, vol. vii. p. 98, and at greater length in vol. vi. p. 104).

Now Lessing criticised this
opinion of Winckelmann's in his Laocoon, and improved it in the
way mentioned above. In place of the psychological he gave the
purely æsthetic reason that beauty, the principle of ancient art,
does not admit of the expression of crying out. Another argument
which he added to this, that a merely passing state incapable
of duration ought not to be represented in motionless works of
art, has a hundred examples of most excellent figures against
it, which are fixed in merely transitory movements, dancing,
wrestling, catching, &c. Indeed Goethe, in the essay on the
Laocoon, which opens the Propylaen (p. 8), holds that the choice
of such a merely fleeting movement is absolutely necessary. In
our own day Hirt (Horen, 1797, tenth St.) finally decided the
point, deducing everything from the highest truth of expression,
that Laocoon does not cry out, because he can no longer do so,
as he is at the point of death from choking. Lastly, Fernow
(“Römische Studien,” vol. i. p. 246) expounded and weighed all
these opinions; he added, however, no new one of his own, but
combined these three eclectically.
I cannot but wonder that such thoughtful and acute men
should laboriously bring far-fetched and insufficient reasons,
should resort to psychological and physiological arguments, to
explain a matter the reason of which lies so near at hand, and is
obvious at once to the unprejudiced; and especially I wonder that
Lessing, who came so near the true explanation, should yet have
entirely missed the real point.

Before all psychological and physiological inquiries as to whether Laocoon would cry out in his position or not (and I certainly affirm that he would), it must be decided as regards
the group in question, that crying out ought not to be expressed
in it, for the simple reason that its expression lies quite outside
the province of sculpture. A shrieking Laocoon could not be
produced in marble, but only a figure with the mouth open
vainly endeavouring to shriek; a Laocoon whose voice has stuck in his throat, vox faucibus haesit. The essence of shrieking,
and consequently its effect upon the onlooker, lies entirely in
sound; not in the distortion of the mouth. This phenomenon,
which necessarily accompanies shrieking, derives motive and
justification only from the sound produced by means of it; then
it is permissible and indeed necessary, as characteristic of the
action, even though it interferes with beauty. But in plastic
art, to which the representation of shrieking is quite foreign and
impossible, it would be actual folly to represent the medium of
violent shrieking, the distorted mouth, which would disturb all
the features and the remainder of the expression; for thus at the
sacrifice of many other things the means would be represented,
while its end, the shrieking itself, and its effect upon our feelings,
would be left out. Nay more, there would be produced the
spectacle of a continuous effort without effect, which is always
ridiculous, and may really be compared to what happened when
some one for a joke stopped the horn of a night watchman with
wax while he was asleep, and then awoke him with the cry of fire,
and amused himself by watching his vain endeavours to blow the
horn. When, on the other hand, the expression of shrieking lies
in the province of poetic or histrionic art, it is quite admissible,
because it helps to express the truth, i.e., the complete expression
of the Idea. Thus it is with poetry, which claims the assistance
of the imagination of the reader, in order to enable it to represent
things perceptibly. Therefore Virgil makes Laocoon cry out [295]
like the bellowing of an ox that has broken loose after being
struck by the axe; and Homer (Il. xx. 48-53) makes Mars and
Minerva shriek horribly, without derogating from their divine
dignity or beauty.

The same with acting; Laocoon on the stage
would certainly have to shriek. Sophocles makes Philoctetus
cry out, and, on the ancient stage at any rate, he must actually
have done so. As a case in point, I remember having seen in
London the great actor Kemble play in a piece called Pizarro,
translated from the German. He took the part of the American, a half-savage, but of very noble character. When he was wounded
he cried out loudly and wildly, which had a great and admirable
effect, for it was exceedingly characteristic and therefore assisted
the truth of the representation very much. On the other hand,
a painted or sculptured model of a man shrieking, would be
much more absurd than the painted music which is censured in
Goethe's Propylaen. For shrieking does far more injury to the
expression and beauty of the whole than music, which at the
most only occupies the hands and arms, and is to be looked upon
as an occupation characteristic of the person; indeed thus far it
may quite rightly be painted, as long as it demands no violent
movement of the body, or distortion of the mouth: for example,
St. Cecilia at the organ, Raphael's violin-player in the Sciarra
Gallery at Rome, and others. Since then, on account of the
limits of the art, the pain of Laocoon must not be expressed by
shrieking, the artist was obliged to employ every other expression
of pain; this he has done in the most perfect manner, as is ably
described by Winckelmann (Works, vol. vi. p. 104), whose
admirable account thus retains its full value and truth, as soon as
we abstract from the stoical view which underlies it.
