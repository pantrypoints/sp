Art cannot be used to express a concept if it is forbidden to start from concept. 

<!-- if The aim of art is to communicate the artist's Idea to a man of weaker comprehension.
, which through the mind of the artist appears in such a form that it is purged and isolated from all that is foreign to it, and may now be grasped by the man of weaker comprehension and no productive faculty; if further, it is forbidden in art to start from the concept, we shall not be able to consent to the intentional and avowed employment of a work of art for the expression of a concept;  -->

This is the case in the Allegory.

An allegory is a work of art which means something different from what it represents.

But the object of perception, and consequently also the Idea, expresses itself directly and completely, and does not require the medium of something else which implies or indicates it.

Thus, that which in this way is indicated and represented by something entirely different,
because it cannot itself be made object of perception, is always a
concept. 

Therefore through the allegory a conception has always
to be signified, and consequently the mind of the beholder has to
be drawn away from the expressed perceptible idea to one which
is entirely different, abstract and not perceptible, and which lies
quite outside the work of art. The picture or statue is intended
to accomplish here what is accomplished far more fully by a
book.

What we hold is the end of art, representation of
a perceivable, comprehensible Idea, is not here the end. No
great completeness in the work of art is demanded for what is
aimed at here. It is only necessary that we should see what the
thing is meant to be, for, as soon as this has been discovered,
the end is reached, and the mind is now led away to quite a
different kind of idea to an abstract conception, which is the
end that was in view. Allegories in plastic and pictorial art are,
therefore, nothing but hieroglyphics; the artistic value which they may have as perceptible representations, belongs to them
not as allegories, but otherwise. 

That the “Night” of Correggio,
the “Genius of Fame” of Hannibal Caracci, and the “Hours” of
Poussin, are very beautiful pictures, is to be separated altogether
from the fact that they are allegories. As allegories they do not [307]
accomplish more than a legend, indeed rather less. We are here
again reminded of the distinction drawn above between the real
and the nominal significance of a picture. The nominal is here the
allegorical as such, for example, the “Genius of Fame.” The real
is what is actually represented, in this case a beautiful winged
youth, surrounded by beautiful boys; this expresses an Idea. But
this real significance affects us only so long as we forget the
nominal, allegorical significance; if we think of the latter, we
forsake the perception, and the mind is occupied with an abstract
conception; but the transition from the Idea to the conception is
always a fall. Indeed, that nominal significance, that allegorical
intention, often injures the real significance, the perceptible truth.
For example, the unnatural light in the “Night” of Correggio,
which, though beautifully executed, has yet a merely allegorical
motive, and is really impossible. If then an allegorical picture
has artistic value, it is quite separate from and independent of
what it accomplishes as allegory. Such a work of art serves two
ends at once, the expression of a conception and the expression
of an Idea.

Only the latter can be an end of art; the other is a
foreign end, the trifling amusement of making a picture also do
service as a legend, as a hieroglyphic, invented for the pleasure
of those to whom the true nature of art can never appeal. It is the
same thing as when a work of art is also a useful implement of
some kind, in which case it also serves two ends; for example,
a statue which is at the same time a candelabrum or a caryatide;
or a bas-relief, which is also the shield of Achilles. True lovers
of art will allow neither the one nor the other. It is true that an
allegorical picture may, because of this quality, produce a vivid
impression upon the feelings; but when this is the case, a legend


would under the same circumstances produce the same effect.
For example, if the desire of fame were firmly and lastingly[308]
rooted in the heart of a man, because he regarded it as his rightful
possession, which is only withheld from him so long as he has
not produced the charter of his ownership; and if the Genius of
Fame, with his laurel crown, were to appear to such a man, his
whole mind would be excited, and his powers called into activity;
but the same effect would be produced if he were suddenly to
see the word “fame,” in large distinct letters on the wall. Or if
a man has made known a truth, which is of importance either
as a maxim for practical life, or as insight for science, but it
has not been believed; an allegorical picture representing time
as it lifts the veil, and discloses the naked figure of Truth, will
affect him powerfully; but the same effect would be produced
by the legend: “Le temps découvre la vérité.” For what really
produces the effect here is the abstract thought, not the object of
perception.

If then, in accordance with what has been said, allegory in
plastic and pictorial art is a mistaken effort, serving an end
which is entirely foreign to art, it becomes quite unbearable
when it leads so far astray that the representation of forced and
violently introduced subtilties degenerates into absurdity. Such,
for example, is a tortoise, to represent feminine seclusion; the
downward glance of Nemesis into the drapery of her bosom,
signifying that she can see into what is hidden; the explanation of
Bellori that Hannibal Carracci represents voluptuousness clothed
in a yellow robe, because he wishes to indicate that her lovers
soon fade and become yellow as straw. If there is absolutely
no connection between the representation and the conception
signified by it, founded on subsumption under the concept,
or association of Ideas; but the signs and the things signified
are combined in a purely conventional manner, by positive,
accidentally introduced laws; then I call this degenerate kind of
allegory Symbolism. 

Thus the rose is the symbol of secrecy, the laurel is the symbol of fame, the palm is the symbol of peace, [309]
the scallop-shell is the symbol of pilgrimage, the cross is the
symbol of the Christian religion. To this class also belongs all
significance of mere colour, as yellow is the colour of falseness,
and blue is the colour of fidelity. Such symbols may often be
of use in life, but their value is foreign to art. They are simply
to be regarded as hieroglyphics, or like Chinese word-writing,
and really belong to the same class as armorial bearings, the
bush that indicates a public-house, the key of the chamberlain,
or the leather of the mountaineer. If, finally, certain historical
or mythical persons, or personified conceptions, are represented
by certain fixed symbols, these are properly called emblems.
Such are the beasts of the Evangelist, the owl of Minerva, the
apple of Paris, the Anchor of Hope, &c. For the most part,
however, we understand by emblems those simple allegorical
representations explained by a motto, which are meant to express
a moral truth, and of which large collections have been made
by J. Camerarius, Alciatus, and others. They form the transition
to poetical allegory, of which we shall have more to say later.
Greek sculpture devotes itself to the perception, and therefore it
is æsthetical; Indian sculpture devotes itself to the conception,
and therefore it is merely symbolical.

This conclusion in regard to allegory, which is founded on our
consideration of the nature of art and quite consistent with it, is
directly opposed to the opinion of Winckelmann, who, far from
explaining allegory, as we do, as something quite foreign to the
end of art, and often interfering with it, always speaks in favour of
it, and indeed (Works, vol. i. p. 55) places the highest aim of art in
the “representation of universal conceptions, and non-sensuous
things.” We leave it to every one to adhere to whichever view
he pleases. Only the truth became very clear to me from these
and similar views of Winckelmann connected with his peculiar
metaphysic of the beautiful, that one may have the greatest
susceptibility for artistic beauty, and the soundest judgment in regard to it, without being able to give an abstract and strictly philosophical justification of the nature of the beautiful; just as
one may be very noble and virtuous, and may have a tender
conscience, which decides with perfect accuracy in particular
cases, without on that account being in a position to investigate
and explain in the abstract the ethical significance of action.

Allegory has an entirely different relation to poetry from that
which it has to plastic and pictorial art, and although it is to
be rejected in the latter, it is not only permissible, but very
serviceable to the former. For in plastic and pictorial art it leads
away from what is perceptibly given, the proper object of all
art, to abstract thoughts; but in poetry the relation is reversed;
for here what is directly given in words is the concept, and the
first aim is to lead from this to the object of perception, the
representation of which must be undertaken by the imagination
of the hearer. If in plastic and pictorial art we are led from
what is immediately given to something else, this must always
be a conception, because here only the abstract cannot be given
directly; but a conception must never be the source, and its
communication must never be the end of a work of art. 

In poetry,
on the contrary, the conception is the material, the immediately
given, and therefore we may very well leave it, in order to
call up perceptions which are quite different, and in which the
end is reached. Many a conception or abstract thought may be
quite indispensable to the connection of a poem, which is yet, in
itself and directly, quite incapable of being perceived; and then
it is often made perceptible by means of some example which
is subsumed under it. This takes place in every trope, every
metaphor, simile, parable, and allegory, all of which differ only
in the length and completeness of their expression.

Therefore,
in the arts which employ language as their medium, similes and
allegories are of striking effect. How beautifully Cervantes[311]
says of sleep in order to express the fact that it frees us from
all spiritual and bodily suffering, “It is a mantle that covers all mankind.” How beautifully Kleist expresses allegorically the
thought that philosophers and men of science enlighten mankind,
in the line, “Those whose midnight lamp lights the world.” How
strongly and sensuously Homer describes the harmful Ate when
he says: “She has tender feet, for she walks not on the hard earth,
but treads on the heads of men” (Il. xix. 91.) How forcibly
we are struck by Menenius Agrippa's fable of the belly and the
limbs, addressed to the people of Rome when they seceded.
How beautifully Plato's figure of the Cave, at the beginning of
the seventh book of the “Republic” to which we have already
referred, expresses a very abstract philosophical dogma. 

The fable of Persephone is also to be regarded as a deeply significant
allegory of philosophical tendency, for she became subject to the
nether world by tasting a pomegranate. This becomes peculiarly
enlightening from Goethe's treatment of the fable, as an episode
in the Triumph der Empfindsamkeit, which is beyond all praise.
Three detailed allegorical works are known to me, one, open and
avowed, is the incomparable “Criticon” of Balthasar Gracian. It
consists of a great rich web of connected and highly ingenious
allegories, that serve here as the fair clothing of moral truths, to
which he thus imparts the most perceptible form, and astonishes
us by the richness of his invention. The two others are concealed
allegories, “Don Quixote” and “Gulliver's Travels.” The first is
an allegory of the life of every man, who will not, like others, be
careful, merely for his own welfare, but follows some objective,
ideal end, which has taken possession of his thoughts and will;
and certainly, in this world, he has then a strange appearance. In
the case of Gulliver we have only to take everything physical as
spiritual or intellectual, in order to see what the “satirical rogue,”
as Hamlet would call him, meant by it. Such, then, in the poetical [312]
allegory, the conception is always the given, which it tries to
make perceptible by means of a picture; it may sometimes be
expressed or assisted by a painted picture. Such a picture will not
be regarded as a work of art, but only as a significant symbol, and
316 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
it makes no claim to pictorial, but only to poetical worth. Such is
that beautiful allegorical vignette of Lavater's, which must be so
heartening to every defender of truth: a hand holding a light is
stung by a wasp, while gnats are burning themselves in the flame
above; underneath is the motto:

“And although it singes the wings of the gnats,
Destroys their heads and all their little brains,
Light is still light;
And although I am stung by the angriest wasp,
I will not let it go.”
To this class also belongs the gravestone with the burnt-out,
smoking candle, and the inscription—
“When it is out, it becomes clear
Whether the candle was tallow or wax.”

Finally, of this kind is an old German genealogical tree,
in which the last representative of a very ancient family thus
expresses his determination to live his life to the end in abstinence
and perfect chastity, and therefore to let his race die out; he
represents himself at the root of the high-branching tree cutting it
over himself with shears. In general all those symbols referred to
above, commonly called emblems, which might also be defined
as short painted fables with obvious morals, belong to this class.
Allegories of this kind are always to be regarded as belonging
to poetry, not to painting, and as justified thereby; moreover,
the pictorial execution is here always a matter of secondary
importance, and no more is demanded of it than that it shall
represent the thing so that we can recognise it. But in poetry, as
in plastic art, the allegory passes into the symbol if there is merely
an arbitrary connection between what it presented to perception[313]
and the abstract significance of it. 

For as all symbolism rests,
at bottom, on an agreement, the symbol has this among other disadvantages, that in time its meaning is forgotten, and then it is dumb. Who would guess why the fish is a symbol of Christianity
if he did not know? Only a Champollion; for it is entirely
a phonetic hieroglyphic. Therefore, as a poetical allegory, the
Revelation of John stands much in the same position as the reliefs
with Magnus Deus sol Mithra, which are still constantly being
explained.
