The aim of plastic and pictorial art to poetry is:
- the revelation of the Ideas
- the grades of the objectification of will
- the communication of them to the hearer

<!--  with the distinctness and
vividness with which the poetical sense comprehends them.  -->

Ideas are essentially perceptible.

If, therefore, in poetry only abstract conceptions are directly communicated through words, it is yet
clearly the intention to make the hearer perceive the Ideas of
life in the representatives of these conceptions, and this can only
take place through the assistance of his own imagination. 

But in order to set the imagination to work for the accomplishment of this end, the abstract conceptions, which are the immediate material of poetry as of dry prose, must be so arranged that their spheres intersect each other in such a way that none of them can remain in its abstract universality; but, instead of it, a perceptible representative appears to the imagination; and this is always further modified by the words of the poet according to what his intention may be. 

As the chemist obtains solid precipitates by combining perfectly clear and transparent fluids; the poet understands how to precipitate, as it were, the concrete, the individual, the perceptible idea, out of the abstract and transparent universality of the concepts by the manner in which he combines them. For the Idea can only be known by perception; [314] and knowledge of the Idea is the end of art. The skill of a master, in poetry as in chemistry, enables us always to obtain the precise precipitate we intended.

This end is assisted by the numerous epithets in poetry, by means of which the universality of every concept is narrowed more and more till we reach the perceptible. Homer attaches to almost every substantive an adjective, whose concept intersects and considerably diminishes the sphere of the concept of the substantive, which is thus brought so much the nearer to perception: for example—

“ïΩ ¥Ω μ¿μ√Ω ©∫μ±ΩÛ ª±º¿¡øΩ ∆±ø¬ !μªπøπø,
ª∫øΩ Ω≈∫ƒ± ºμª±πΩ±Ω μ¿π ∂μπ¥…¡øΩ ±¡ø≈¡±Ω.”
(“Occidit vero in Oceanum splendidum lumen solis,
Trahens noctem nigram super almam terram.”)
And—

“Where gentle winds from the blue heavens sigh,
There stand the myrtles still, the laurel high,”—

calls up before the imagination by means of a few concepts
the whole delight of a southern clime.
Rhythm and rhyme are quite peculiar aids to poetry. I can give
no other explanation of their incredibly powerful effect than that
our faculties of perception have received from time, to which
they are essentially bound, some quality on account of which
we inwardly follow, and, as it were, consent to each regularly
recurring sound. In this way rhythm and rhyme are partly a
means of holding our attention, because we willingly follow the
poem read, and partly they produce in us a blind consent to what
is read prior to any judgment, and this gives the poem a certain
emphatic power of convincing independent of all reasons.
From the general nature of the material, that is, the concepts,
which poetry uses to communicate the Ideas, the extent of its
province is very great. The whole of nature, the Ideas of[315]
all grades, can be represented by means of it, for it proceeds
according to the Idea it has to impart, so that its representations
319
are sometimes descriptive, sometimes narrative, and sometimes
directly dramatic. If, in the representation of the lower grades of
the objectivity of will, plastic and pictorial art generally surpass
it, because lifeless nature, and even brute nature, reveals almost
its whole being in a single well-chosen moment; man, on the
contrary, so far as he does not express himself by the mere form
and expression of his person, but through a series of actions and
the accompanying thoughts and emotions, is the principal object
of poetry, in which no other art can compete with it, for here the
progress or movement which cannot be represented in plastic or
pictorial art just suits its purpose.
The revelation of the Idea, which is the highest grade of the
objectivity of will, the representation of man in the connected
series of his efforts and actions, is thus the great problem of
poetry. It is true that both experience and history teach us to
know man; yet oftener men than man, i.e., they give us empirical
notes of the behaviour of men to each other, from which we
may frame rules for our own conduct, oftener than they afford
us deep glimpses of the inner nature of man. The latter function,
however, is by no means entirely denied them; but as often
as it is the nature of mankind itself that discloses itself to us
in history or in our own experience, we have comprehended
our experience, and the historian has comprehended history,
with artistic eyes, poetically, i.e., according to the Idea, not the
phenomenon, in its inner nature, not in its relations. Our own
experience is the indispensable condition of understanding poetry
as of understanding history; for it is, so to speak, the dictionary
of the language that both speak. But history is related to poetry
as portrait-painting is related to historical painting; the one gives
us the true in the individual, the other the true in the universal;
the one has the truth of the phenomenon, and can therefore [316]
verify it from the phenomenal, the other has the truth of the Idea,
which can be found in no particular phenomenon, but yet speaks
to us from them all. The poet from deliberate choice represents
320 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
significant characters in significant situations; the historian takes
both as they come. Indeed, he must regard and select the
circumstances and the persons, not with reference to their inward
and true significance, which expresses the Idea, but according to
the outward, apparent, and relatively important significance with
regard to the connection and the consequences. He must consider
nothing in and for itself in its essential character and expression,
but must look at everything in its relations, in its connection,
in its influence upon what follows, and especially upon its own
age. Therefore he will not overlook an action of a king, though
of little significance, and in itself quite common, because it has
results and influence. And, on the other hand, actions of the
highest significance of particular and very eminent individuals
are not to be recorded by him if they have no consequences.
For his treatment follows the principle of sufficient reason, and
apprehends the phenomenon, of which this principle is the form.
But the poet comprehends the Idea, the inner nature of man apart
from all relations, outside all time, the adequate objectivity of
the thing-in-itself, at its highest grade. Even in that method of
treatment which is necessary for the historian, the inner nature
and significance of the phenomena, the kernel of all these shells,
can never be entirely lost. He who seeks for it, at any rate, may
find it and recognise it. Yet that which is significant in itself,
not in its relations, the real unfolding of the Idea, will be found
far more accurately and distinctly in poetry than in history, and,
therefore, however paradoxical it may sound, far more really
genuine inner truth is to be attributed to poetry than to history.
For the historian must accurately follow the particular event
according to life, as it develops itself in time in the manifold[317]
tangled chains of causes and effects. It is, however, impossible
that he can have all the data for this; he cannot have seen all
and discovered all. He is forsaken at every moment by the
original of his picture, or a false one substitutes itself for it, and
this so constantly that I think I may assume that in all history
321
the false outweighs the true. The poet, on the contrary, has
comprehended the Idea of man from some definite side which
is to be represented; thus it is the nature of his own self that
objectifies itself in it for him. His knowledge, as we explained
above when speaking of sculpture, is half a priori; his ideal
stands before his mind firm, distinct, brightly illuminated, and
cannot forsake him; therefore he shows us, in the mirror of his
mind, the Idea pure and distinct, and his delineation of it down
to the minutest particular is true as life itself.59 The great ancient
historians are, therefore, in those particulars in which their data
fail them, for example, in the speeches of their heroes—poets;
indeed their whole manner of handling their material approaches
to the epic. But this gives their representations unity, and [318]
enables them to retain inner truth, even when outward truth was
not accessible, or indeed was falsified. And as we compared
history to portrait-painting, in contradistinction to poetry, which
59 It is scarcely necessary to say that wherever I speak of poets I refer
exclusively to that rare phenomenon the great true poet. I mean no one else;
least of all that dull insipid tribe, the mediocre poets, rhymsters, and inventors
of fables, that flourishes so luxuriantly at the present day in Germany. They
ought rather to have the words shouted in their ears unceasingly from all
sides—
Mediocribus esse poëtis
Non homines, non Dî, non concessere columnæ.
It is worthy of serious consideration what an amount of time—both their
own and other people's—and paper is lost by this swarm of mediocre poets,
and how injurious is their influence. For the public always seizes on what
is new, and has naturally a greater proneness to what is perverse and dull as
akin to itself. Therefore these works of the mediocre poets draw it away and
hold it back from the true masterpieces and the education they afford, and thus
working in direct antagonism to the benign influence of genius, they ruin taste
more and more, and retard the progress of the age. Such poets should therefore
be scourged with criticism and satire without indulgence or sympathy till they
are induced, for their own good, to apply their muse rather to reading what is
good than to writing what is bad. For if the bungling of the incompetent so
raised the wrath of the gentle Apollo that he could flay Marsyas, I do not see
on what the mediocre poets will base their claim to tolerance.
322 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
corresponds to historical painting, we find that Winckelmann's
maxim, that the portrait ought to be the ideal of the individual,
was followed by the ancient historians, for they represent the
individual in such a way as to bring out that side of the Idea of
man which is expressed in it. Modern historians, on the contrary,
with few exceptions, give us in general only “a dust-bin and a
lumber-room, and at the most a chronicle of the principal political
events.” Therefore, whoever desires to know man in his inner
nature, identical in all its phenomena and developments, to know
him according to the Idea, will find that the works of the great,
immortal poet present a far truer, more distinct picture, than the
historians can ever give. For even the best of the historians
are, as poets, far from the first; and moreover their hands are
tied. In this aspect the relation between the historian and the
poet may be illustrated by the following comparison. The mere,
pure historian, who works only according to data, is like a man,
who without any knowledge of mathematics, has investigated
the relations of certain figures, which he has accidentally found,
by measuring them; and the problem thus empirically solved is
affected of course by all the errors of the drawn figure. The poet,
on the other hand, is like the mathematician, who constructs
these relations a priori in pure perception, and expresses them
not as they actually are in the drawn figure, but as they are in
the Idea, which the drawing is intended to render for the senses.
Therefore Schiller says:—
“What has never anywhere come to pass,
That alone never grows old.”
[319]
Indeed I must attribute greater value to biographies, and
especially to autobiographies, in relation to the knowledge of the
nature of man, than to history proper, at least as it is commonly
handled. Partly because in the former the data can be collected
more accurately and completely than in the latter; partly, because
323
in history proper, it is not so much men as nations and heroes
that act, and the individuals who do appear, seem so far off,
surrounded with such pomp and circumstance, clothed in the
stiff robes of state, or heavy, inflexible armour, that it is really
hard through all this to recognise the human movements. On
the other hand, the life of the individual when described with
truth, in a narrow sphere, shows the conduct of men in all
its forms and subtilties, the excellence, the virtue, and even
holiness of a few, the perversity, meanness, and knavery of
most, the dissolute profligacy of some. Besides, in the only
aspect we are considering here, that of the inner significance of
the phenomenal, it is quite the same whether the objects with
which the action is concerned, are, relatively considered, trifling
or important, farm-houses or kingdoms: for all these things in
themselves are without significance, and obtain it only in so
far as the will is moved by them. The motive has significance
only through its relation to the will, while the relation which it
has as a thing to other things like itself, does not concern us
here. As a circle of one inch in diameter, and a circle of forty
million miles in diameter, have precisely the same geometrical
properties, so are the events and the history of a village and a
kingdom essentially the same; and we may study and learn to
know mankind as well in the one as in the other. It is also a
mistake to suppose that autobiographies are full of deceit and
dissimulation. On the contrary, lying (though always possible)
is perhaps more difficult there than elsewhere. Dissimulation
is easiest in mere conversation; indeed, though it may sound
paradoxical, it is really more difficult even in a letter. For in the [320]
case of a letter the writer is alone, and looks into himself, and
not out on the world, so that what is strange and distant does not
easily approach him; and he has not the test of the impression
made upon another before his eyes. But the receiver of the letter
peruses it quietly in a mood unknown to the writer, reads it
repeatedly and at different times, and thus easily finds out the
324 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
concealed intention. We also get to know an author as a man most
easily from his books, because all these circumstances act here
still more strongly and permanently. And in an autobiography it
is so difficult to dissimulate, that perhaps there does not exist a
single one that is not, as a whole, more true, than any history that
ever was written. The man who writes his own life surveys it as
a whole, the particular becomes small, the near becomes distant,
the distant becomes near again, the motives that influenced him
shrink; he seats himself at the confessional, and has done so
of his own free will; the spirit of lying does not so easily take
hold of him here, for there is also in every man an inclination
to truth which has first to be overcome whenever he lies, and
which here has taken up a specially strong position. The relation
between biography and the history of nations may be made clear
for perception by means of the following comparison: History
shows us mankind as a view from a high mountain shows us
nature; we see much at a time, wide stretches, great masses,
but nothing is distinct nor recognisable in all the details of its
own peculiar nature. On the other hand, the representation of
the life of the individual shows us the man, as we see nature if
we go about among her trees, plants, rocks, and waters. But in
landscape-painting, in which the artist lets us look at nature with
his eyes, the knowledge of the Ideas, and the condition of pure
will-less knowing, which is demanded by these, is made much
easier for us; and, in the same way, poetry is far superior both to
history and biography, in the representation of the Ideas which[321]
may be looked for in all three. For here also genius holds up to
us the magic glass, in which all that is essential and significant
appears before us collected and placed in the clearest light, and
what is accidental and foreign is left out.60
The representation of the Idea of man, which is the work of the
poet, may be performed, so that what is represented is also the
60 Cf. Ch. xxxviii. of Supplement.
325
representer. This is the case in lyrical poetry, in songs, properly
so called, in which the poet only perceives vividly his own state
and describes it. Thus a certain subjectivity is essential to this
kind of poetry from the nature of its object. Again, what is to be
represented may be entirely different from him who represents
it, as is the case in all other kinds of poetry, in which the poet
more or less conceals himself behind his representation, and at
last disappears altogether. In the ballad the poet still expresses
to some extent his own state through the tone and proportion
of the whole; therefore, though much more objective than the
lyric, it has yet something subjective. This becomes less in the
idyll, still less in the romantic poem, almost entirely disappears
in the true epic, and even to the last vestige in the drama,
which is the most objective and, in more than one respect, the
completest and most difficult form of poetry. The lyrical form of
poetry is consequently the easiest, and although art, as a whole,
belongs only to the true man of genius, who so rarely appears,
even a man who is not in general very remarkable may produce
a beautiful song if, by actual strong excitement from without,
some inspiration raises his mental powers; for all that is required
for this is a lively perception of his own state at a moment
of emotional excitement. This is proved by the existence of
many single songs by individuals who have otherwise remained
unknown; especially the German national songs, of which we
have an exquisite collection in the “Wunderhorn;” and also [322]
by innumerable love-songs and other songs of the people in all
languages;—for to seize the mood of a moment and embody
it in a song is the whole achievement of this kind of poetry.
Yet in the lyrics of true poets the inner nature of all mankind
is reflected, and all that millions of past, present, and future
men have found, or will find, in the same situations, which are
constantly recurring, finds its exact expression in them. And
because these situations, by constant recurrence, are permanent
as man himself and always call up the same sensations, the lyrical
326 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
productions of genuine poets remain through thousands of years
true, powerful, and fresh. But if the poet is always the universal
man, then all that has ever moved a human heart, all that human
nature in any situation has ever produced from itself, all that
dwells and broods in any human breast—is his theme and his
material, and also all the rest of nature. 

Therefore the poet may
just as well sing of voluptuousness as of mysticism, be Anacreon
or Angelus Silesius, write tragedies or comedies, represent the
sublime or the common mind—according to humour or vocation.
And no one has the right to prescribe to the poet what he ought
to be—noble and sublime, moral, pious, Christian, one thing
or another, still less to reproach him because he is one thing
and not another. He is the mirror of mankind, and brings to its
consciousness what it feels and does.

If we now consider more closely the nature of the lyric
proper, and select as examples exquisite and pure models, not
those that approach in any way to some other form of poetry,
such as the ballad, the elegy, the hymn, the epigram, &c., we
shall find that the peculiar nature of the lyric, in the narrowest
sense, is this: It is the subject of will, i.e., his own volition,
which the consciousness of the singer feels; often as a released
and satisfied desire (joy), but still oftener as a restricted desire
(grief), always as an emotion, a passion, a moved frame of
mind. Besides this, however, and along with it, by the sight of[323]
surrounding nature, the singer becomes conscious of himself as
the subject of pure, will-less knowing, whose unbroken blissful
peace now appears, in contrast to the stress of desire which
is always restricted and always needy. The feeling of this
contrast, this alternation, is really what the lyric as a whole
expresses, and what principally constitutes the lyrical state of
mind. In it pure knowing comes to us, as it were, to deliver
us from desire and its stain; we follow, but only for an instant;
desire, the remembrance of our own personal ends, tears us anew
from peaceful contemplation; yet ever again the next beautiful
327
surrounding in which the pure will-less knowledge presents itself
to us, allures us away from desire. Therefore, in the lyric and
the lyrical mood, desire (the personal interest of the ends), and
pure perception of the surrounding presented, are wonderfully
mingled with each other; connections between them are sought
for and imagined; the subjective disposition, the affection of
the will, imparts its own hue to the perceived surrounding, and
conversely, the surroundings communicate the reflex of their
colour to the will. The true lyric is the expression of the whole of
this mingled and divided state of mind. In order to make clear by
examples this abstract analysis of a frame of mind that is very far
from all abstraction, any of the immortal songs of Goethe may
be taken. As specially adapted for this end I shall recommend
only a few: “The Shepherd's Lament,” “Welcome and Farewell,”
“To the Moon,” “On the Lake,” “Autumn;” also the songs in
the “Wunderhorn” are excellent examples; particularly the one
which begins, “O Bremen, I must now leave thee.” As a comical
and happy parody of the lyrical character a song of Voss strikes
me as remarkable. It describes the feeling of a drunk plumber
falling from a tower, who observes in passing that the clock on
the tower is at half-past eleven, a remark which is quite foreign
to his condition, and thus belongs to knowledge free from will. [324]
Whoever accepts the view that has been expressed of the lyrical
frame of mind, will also allow, that it is the sensuous and poetical
knowledge of the principle which I established in my essay on
the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and have also referred to
in this work, that the identity of the subject of knowing with
that of willing may be called the miracle ∫±ƒΩ μæø«∑Ω; so that
the poetical effect of the lyric rests finally on the truth of that
principle. In the course of life these two subjects, or, in popular
language, head and heart, are ever becoming further apart; men
are always separating more between their subjective feeling and
their objective knowledge. In the child the two are still entirely
blended together; it scarcely knows how to distinguish itself from
328 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
its surroundings, it is at one with them. In the young man all
perception chiefly affects feeling and mood, and even mingles
with it, as Byron very beautifully expresses—
“I live not in myself, but I become
Portion of that around me; and to me
High mountains are a feeling.”

This is why the youth clings so closely to the perceptible and
outward side of things; this is why he is only fit for lyrical poetry,
and only the full-grown man is capable of the drama. The old
man we can think of as at the most an epic poet, like Ossian, and
Homer, for narration is characteristic of old age.

In the more objective kinds of poetry, especially in the
romance, the epic, and the drama, the end, the revelation of
the Idea of man, is principally attained by two means, by
true and profound representation of significant characters, and
by the invention of pregnant situations in which they disclose
themselves. For as it is incumbent upon the chemist not only to
exhibit the simple elements, pure and genuine, and their principal
compounds, but also to expose them to the influence of such
reagents as will clearly and strikingly bring out their peculiar[325]
qualities, so is it incumbent on the poet not only to present
to us significant characters truly and faithfully as nature itself;
but, in order that we may get to know them, he must place
them in those situations in which their peculiar qualities will
fully unfold themselves, and appear distinctly in sharp outline;
situations which are therefore called significant. In real life, and
in history, situations of this kind are rarely brought about by
chance, and they stand alone, lost and concealed in the multitude
of those which are insignificant. The complete significance of
the situations ought to distinguish the romance, the epic, and
the drama from real life as completely as the arrangement and
selection of significant characters. In both, however, absolute
329
truth is a necessary condition of their effect, and want of unity in
the characters, contradiction either of themselves or of the nature
of humanity in general, as well as impossibility, or very great
improbability in the events, even in mere accessories, offend just
as much in poetry as badly drawn figures, false perspective, or
wrong lighting in painting. For both in poetry and painting we
demand the faithful mirror of life, of man, of the world, only
made more clear by the representation, and more significant by
the arrangement. For there is only one end of all the arts, the
representation of the Ideas; and their essential difference lies
simply in the different grades of the objectification of will to
which the Ideas that are to be represented belong. This also
determines the material of the representation. Thus the arts
which are most widely separated may yet throw light on each
other. For example, in order to comprehend fully the Ideas
of water it is not sufficient to see it in the quiet pond or in
the evenly-flowing stream; but these Ideas disclose themselves
fully only when the water appears under all circumstances and
exposed to all kinds of obstacles. 

The effects of the varied
circumstances and obstacles give it the opportunity of fully exhibiting all its qualities. This is why we find it beautiful when
it tumbles, rushes, and foams, or leaps into the air, or falls in
a cataract of spray; or, lastly, if artificially confined it springs
up in a fountain. Thus showing itself different under different
circumstances, it yet always faithfully asserts its character; it is
just as natural to it to spout up as to lie in glassy stillness; it is
as ready for the one as for the other as soon as the circumstances
appear. Now, what the engineer achieves with the fluid matter
of water, the architect achieves with the rigid matter of stone,
and just this the epic or dramatic poet achieves with the Idea of
man. Unfolding and rendering distinct the Idea expressing itself
in the object of every art, the Idea of the will which objectifies
itself at each grade, is the common end of all the arts. 

The life
of man, as it shows itself for the most part in the real world, is like the water, as it is generally seen in the pond and the river;
but in the epic, the romance, the tragedy, selected characters are
placed in those circumstances in which all their special qualities
unfold themselves, the depths of the human heart are revealed,
and become visible in extraordinary and very significant actions.
Thus poetry objectifies the Idea of man, an Idea which has the
peculiarity of expressing itself in highly individual characters.
Tragedy is to be regarded, and is recognised as the summit
of poetical art, both on account of the greatness of its effect
and the difficulty of its achievement. 


It is very significant for our whole system, and well worthy of observation, that the end
of this highest poetical achievement is the representation of the
terrible side of life. The unspeakable pain, the wail of humanity,
the triumph of evil, the scornful mastery of chance, and the
irretrievable fall of the just and innocent, is here presented to us;
and in this lies a significant hint of the nature of the world and of
existence. It is the strife of will with itself, which here, completely
unfolded at the highest grade of its objectivity, comes into fearful[327]
prominence. It becomes visible in the suffering of men, which is
now introduced, partly through chance and error, which appear
as the rulers of the world, personified as fate, on account of their
insidiousness, which even reaches the appearance of design;
partly it proceeds from man himself, through the self-mortifying
efforts of a few, through the wickedness and perversity of most.
It is one and the same will that lives and appears in them all,
but whose phenomena fight against each other and destroy each
other. In one individual it appears powerfully, in another more
weakly; in one more subject to reason, and softened by the light
of knowledge, in another less so, till at last, in some single
case, this knowledge, purified and heightened by suffering itself,
reaches the point at which the phenomenon, the veil of Mâya, no
longer deceives it. It sees through the form of the phenomenon,
the principium individuationis. 

The egoism which rests on this
perishes with it, so that now the motives that were so powerful before have lost their might, and instead of them the complete
knowledge of the nature of the world, which has a quieting effect
on the will, produces resignation, the surrender not merely of life,
but of the very will to live. Thus we see in tragedies the noblest
men, after long conflict and suffering, at last renounce the ends
they have so keenly followed, and all the pleasures of life for
ever, or else freely and joyfully surrender life itself. So is it with
the steadfast prince of Calderon; with Gretchen in “Faust;” with
Hamlet, whom his friend Horatio would willingly follow, but is
bade remain a while, and in this harsh world draw his breath in
pain, to tell the story of Hamlet, and clear his memory; so also
is it with the Maid of Orleans, the Bride of Messina; they all
die purified by suffering, i.e., after the will to live which was
formerly in them is dead. In the “Mohammed” of Voltaire this
is actually expressed in the concluding words which the dying [328]
Palmira addresses to Mohammad: “The world is for tyrants:
live!” On the other hand, the demand for so-called poetical
justice rests on entire misconception of the nature of tragedy,
and, indeed, of the nature of the world itself. It boldly appears in
all its dulness in the criticisms which Dr. Samuel Johnson made
on particular plays of Shakespeare, for he very naïvely laments
its entire absence. And its absence is certainly obvious, for in
what has Ophelia, Desdemona, or Cordelia offended? But only
the dull, optimistic, Protestant-rationalistic, or peculiarly Jewish
view of life will make the demand for poetical justice, and find
satisfaction in it. The true sense of tragedy is the deeper insight,
that it is not his own individual sins that the hero atones for, but
original sin, i.e., the crime of existence itself:

“Pues el delito mayor
Del hombre es haber nacido;”
(“For the greatest crime of man
Is that he was born;”)
as Calderon exactly expresses it.


The representation of a great misfortune is alone essential to tragedy. This may be brought in 3 ways:

1. Through a very wicked character

Examples are Richard 3, Iago in “Othello,” Shylock in “The Merchant of Venice,” Franz Moor, Phædra of Euripides, Creon in the “Antigone,” &c., &c. 

2. Through blind fate as chance and error

Examples are the Œdipus Rex of Sophocles, the “Trachiniæ” also; and in general most of the tragedies of the ancients belong to this class. 

Among modern  tragedies, “Romeo and Juliet,” “Tancred” by Voltaire, and “The
Bride of Messina,” are examples.

3. Through relations of the mere position of the dramatis personæ with regard to each other

so that there is no need either for a tremendous error or an unheard-of accident,
nor yet for a character whose wickedness reaches the limits of
human possibility; 

but characters of ordinary morality, under
circumstances such as often occur, are so situated with regard
to each other that their position compels them, knowingly and
with their eyes open, to do each other the greatest injury, without
any one of them being entirely in the wrong. 

This last kind of tragedy seems to me far to surpass the other two, for it shows
us the greatest misfortune, not as an exception, not as something
occasioned by rare circumstances or monstrous characters, but
as arising easily and of itself out of the actions and characters
of men, indeed almost as essential to them, and thus brings it
terribly near to us. In the other two kinds we may look on the
prodigious fate and the horrible wickedness as terrible powers
which certainly threaten us, but only from afar, which we may
very well escape without taking refuge in renunciation. 

But in the last kind of tragedy we see that those powers which destroy
happiness and life are such that their path to us also is open at
every moment; we see the greatest sufferings brought about by
entanglements that our fate might also partake of, and through
actions that perhaps we also are capable of performing, and
so could not complain of injustice; then shuddering we feel
ourselves already in the midst of hell. This last kind of tragedy
is also the most difficult of achievement; for the greatest effect
has to be produced in it with the least use of means and causes
of movement, merely through the position and distribution of
the characters; therefore even in many of the best tragedies this
difficulty is evaded. Yet one tragedy may be referred to as a [330]
perfect model of this kind, a tragedy which in other respects is far
surpassed by more than one work of the same great master; it is
“Clavigo.” “Hamlet” belongs to a certain extent to this class, as
far as the relation of Hamlet to Laertes and Ophelia is concerned.
“Wallenstein” has also this excellence. “Faust” belongs entirely
to this class, if we regard the events connected with Gretchen and
her brother as the principal action; also the “Cid” of Corneille,
only that it lacks the tragic conclusion, while on the contrary the
analogous relation of Max to Thecla has it.61
