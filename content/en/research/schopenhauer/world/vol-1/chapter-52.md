<!--  52. Now that we have considered all the fine arts in the
general way that is suitable to our point of view, beginning
with architecture, the peculiar end of which is to elucidate the
objectification of will at the lowest grades of its visibility, in
which it shows itself as the dumb unconscious tendency of the
mass in accordance with laws, and yet already reveals a breach
of the unity of will with itself in a conflict between gravity
and rigidity—and ending with the consideration of tragedy,
which presents to us at the highest grades of the objectification
of will this very conflict with itself in terrible magnitude and
distinctness; we find that there is still another fine art which has
61 Cf. Ch. xxxvii. of the Supplement.

been excluded from our consideration, and had to be excluded,
for in the systematic connection of our exposition there was no
fitting place for it—I mean music.  -->

Music stands alone cut off from all the other arts. 

In music, we do not recognise the copy or repetition of any Idea of existence in the world. 

Yet it is such a great and exceedingly noble art, its effect on the inmost nature of man is so powerful, and it is so entirely and deeply understood by him in his inmost consciousness as a perfectly universal language, the distinctness of which surpasses even that of the perceptible world itself, that we certainly have more to look for in it than an exercitum arithmeticæ occultum nescientis se numerare animi,62 which Leibnitz called it.

Yet he was perfectly right, as he considered only its immediate external significance, its form. But if it were nothing more, the satisfaction which it affords would be like that which we feel when a sum in arithmetic comes out right, and could not be that intense pleasure with which we see the deepest recesses of our nature find utterance.

From our standpoint, therefore, at which the æsthetic effect is the criterion, we must attribute to music a far more serious and deep significance, connected with the inmost nature of the world and our own self, and in reference to which the arithmetical proportions, to which it may be reduced, are related, not as the thing signified, but merely as the sign.

That in some sense music
must be related to the world as the representation to the thing
represented, as the copy to the original, we may conclude from
the analogy of the other arts, all of which possess this character,
and affect us on the whole in the same way as it does, only
that the effect of music is stronger, quicker, more necessary and
infallible. 

Its representative relation to the world must
be very deep, absolutely true, and strikingly accurate, because it
is instantly understood by every one, and has the appearance of a
certain infallibility, because its form may be reduced to perfectly definite rules expressed in numbers, from which it cannot free
itself without entirely ceasing to be music. Yet the point of
comparison between music and the world, the respect in which
it stands to the world in the relation of a copy or repetition,
is very obscure. Men have practised music in all ages without
being able to account for this; content to understand it directly,
they renounce all claim to an abstract conception of this direct
understanding itself.

I gave my mind entirely up to the impression of music in all its [332]
forms, and then returned to reflection and the system of thought
expressed in the present work, and thus I arrived at an explanation
of the inner nature of music and of the nature of its imitative
relation to the world—which from analogy had necessarily to
be presupposed—an explanation which is quite sufficient for
myself, and satisfactory to my investigation, and which will
doubtless be equally evident to any one who has followed me
thus far and has agreed with my view of the world. 

It is impossible to prove this explanation, for it assumes and establishes a relation of music, as idea, to that which from its nature can never be idea, and music will have to be regarded as the copy of an original which can
never itself be directly presented as idea. I can therefore do no
more than state here, at the conclusion of this third book, which
has been principally devoted to the consideration of the arts,
the explanation of the marvellous art of music which satisfies
myself, and I must leave the acceptance or denial of my view
to the effect produced upon each of my readers both by music
itself and by the whole system of thought communicated in this
work. 

I regard it as necessary, in order to be able to
assent with full conviction to the exposition of the significance
of music I am about to give, that one should often listen to music
with constant reflection upon my theory concerning it, and for
this again it is necessary to be very familiar with the whole of
my system of thought.

The (Platonic) Ideas are the adequate objectification of will.

To excite or suggest the knowledge of these by means of the representation of particular things (for works of art themselves are always representations of particular things) is the end of all the other arts, which can only be attained by a corresponding change in the knowing subject. Thus all these arts objectify the will indirectly only by means of the Ideas;

Since our world is nothing but the manifestation of the Ideas in multiplicity, though their entrance into the principium individuationis (the form of the knowledge possible for the individual as such), music also,
since it passes over the Ideas, is entirely independent of the
phenomenal world, ignores it altogether, could to a certain extent
exist if there was no world at all, which cannot be said of the other
arts. Music is as direct an objectification and copy of the whole
will as the world itself, nay, even as the Ideas, whose multiplied
manifestation constitutes the world of individual things. 

Music is thus:
- not like the other arts, the copy of the Ideas.
- the copy of the will itself, whose objectivity the Ideas are.

This is why the effect of music is so much more powerful and
penetrating than that of the other arts, for they speak only of
shadows, but it speaks of the thing itself. Since, however, it is the
same will which objectifies itself both in the Ideas and in music,
though in quite different ways, there must be, not indeed a direct
likeness, but yet a parallel, an analogy, between music and the
Ideas whose manifestation in multiplicity and incompleteness is
the visible world. 

The establishing of this analogy will facilitate, as an illustration, the understanding of this exposition, which is
so difficult on account of the obscurity of the subject. 

I recognise in the deepest tones of harmony, in the bass, the
lowest grades of the objectification of will, unorganised nature,
the mass of the planet. It is well known that all the high
notes which are easily sounded, and die away more quickly, are
produced by the vibration in their vicinity of the deep bass-notes.

When, also, the low notes sound, the high notes always sound faintly, and it is a law of harmony that only those high notes
may accompany a bass-note which actually already sound along
with it of themselves (its sons harmoniques) on account of its
vibration. This is analogous to the fact that the whole of the bodies and organisations of nature must be regarded as having come into existence through gradual development out of the mass of the planet; this is both their supporter and their source, and the same relation subsists between the high notes and the bass.

There is a limit of depth, below which no sound is audible. This corresponds to the fact that no matter can be perceived without
form and quality, i.e., without the manifestation of a force which
cannot be further explained, in which an Idea expresses itself,
and, more generally, that no matter can be entirely without will.
Thus, as a certain pitch is inseparable from the note as such,
so a certain grade of the manifestation of will is inseparable
from matter. Bass is thus, for us, in harmony what unorganised
nature, the crudest mass, upon which all rests, and from which
everything originates and develops, is in the world.
