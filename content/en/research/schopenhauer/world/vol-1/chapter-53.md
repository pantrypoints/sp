This Book is the most serious for it relates to the action of men.

<!-- the matter which concerns every
one directly and can be foreign or indifferent to none. It is indeed
so characteristic of  -->

The nature of man relates everything else to action, that in every systematic investigation he will always
treat the part that has to do with action as the result or outcome
of the whole work, so far, at least, as it interests him, and will
therefore give his most serious attention to this part, even if to
no other. In this respect the following part of our work would, in
ordinary language, be called practical philosophy, in opposition
to the theoretical, which has occupied us hitherto. But, in my
opinion, all philosophy is theoretical, because it is essential to it
that it should retain a purely contemplative attitude, and should
investigate, not prescribe. To become, on the contrary, practical,
to guide conduct, to transform character, are old claims, which
with fuller insight it ought finally to give up. For here, where
351
the worth or worthlessness of an existence, where salvation or
damnation are in question, the dead conceptions of philosophy
do not decide the matter, but the inmost nature of man himself,
the Dæmon that guides him and that has not chosen him, but been
chosen by him, as Plato would say; his intelligible character, as
Kant expresses himself. Virtue cannot be taught any more than
genius; indeed, for it the concept is just as unfruitful as it is in art,
and in both cases can only be used as an instrument. It would, [350]
therefore, be just as absurd to expect that our moral systems and
ethics will produce virtuous, noble, and holy men, as that our
æsthetics will produce poets, painters, and musicians.
Philosophy can never do more than interpret and explain what
is given. It can only bring to distinct abstract knowledge of the
reason the nature of the world which in the concrete, that is,
as feeling, expresses itself comprehensibly to every one. This,
however, it does in every possible reference and from every
point of view. Now, as this attempt has been made from other
points of view in the three preceding books with the generality
that is proper to philosophy, in this book the action of men
will be considered in the same way; and this side of the world
might, indeed, be considered the most important of all, not
only subjectively, as I remarked above, but also objectively.
In considering it I shall faithfully adhere to the method I have
hitherto followed, and shall support myself by presupposing all
that has already been advanced. There is, indeed, just one thought
which forms the content of this whole work. I have endeavoured
to work it out in all other spheres, and I shall now do so with
regard to human action. I shall then have done all that is in my
power to communicate it as fully as possible.
The given point of view, and the method of treatment
announced, are themselves sufficient to indicate that in this
ethical book no precepts, no doctrine of duty must be looked
for; still less will a general moral principle be given, an
universal receipt, as it were, for the production of all the virtues.
352 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
Neither shall we talk of an “absolute ought,” for this contains
a contradiction, as is explained in the Appendix; nor yet of a
“law of freedom,” which is in the same position. In general,
we shall not speak at all of “ought,” for this is how one speaks
to children and to nations still in their childhood, but not to
those who have appropriated all the culture of a full-grown age.[351]
It is a palpable contradiction to call the will free, and yet to
prescribe laws for it according to which it ought to will. “Ought
to will!”—wooden iron! But it follows from the point of view
of our system that the will is not only free, but almighty. From
it proceeds not only its action, but also its world; and as the will
is, so does its action and its world become. Both are the self-
knowledge of the will and nothing more. The will determines
itself, and at the same time both its action and its world; for
besides it there is nothing, and these are the will itself. Only
thus is the will truly autonomous, and from every other point
of view it is heteronomous. Our philosophical endeavours can
only extend to exhibiting and explaining the action of men in its
inner nature and content, the various and even opposite maxims,
whose living expression it is. This we shall do in connection with
the preceding portion of our work, and in precisely the same way
as we have hitherto explained the other phenomena of the world,
and have sought to bring their inmost nature to distinct abstract
knowledge. Our philosophy will maintain the same immanency
in the case of action, as in all that we have hitherto considered.
Notwithstanding Kant's great doctrine, it will not attempt to use
the forms of the phenomenon, the universal expression of which
is the principle of sufficient reason, as a leaping-pole to jump
over the phenomenon itself, which alone gives meaning to these
forms, and land in the boundless sphere of empty fictions. But
this actual world of experience, in which we are, and which is in
us, remains both the material and the limits of our consideration:
a world which is so rich in content that even the most searching
investigation of which the human mind is capable could not
353
exhaust it. Since then the real world of experience will never fail
to afford material and reality to our ethical investigations, any
more than to those we have already conducted, nothing will be
less needful than to take refuge in negative conceptions void of [352]
content, and then somehow or other make even ourselves believe
that we are saying something when we speak with lifted eyebrows
of “absolutes,” “infinites,” “supersensibles,” and whatever other
mere negations of this sort there may be (ø≈¥μΩ μ√ƒπ, ∑ ƒø
ƒ∑¬ √ƒμ¡∑√μ…¬ øΩøº±, ºμƒ± ±º≈¥¡±¬ μ¿πΩøπ±¬—nihil est, nisi
negationis nomen, cum obscura notione.—Jul. or. 5), instead
of which it would be shorter to say at once cloud-cuckoo-town
(Ωμ∆μªø∫ø∫∫≈≥π±): we shall not require to serve up covered
empty dishes of this kind. Finally, we shall not in this book, any
more than in those which have preceded it, narrate histories and
give them out as philosophy. For we are of opinion that whoever
supposes that the inner nature of the world can in any way,
however plausibly disguised, be historically comprehended, is
infinitely far from a philosophical knowledge of the world. Yet
this is what is supposed whenever a “becoming,” or a “having
become,” or an “about to become” enters into a theory of the
nature of the world, whenever an earlier or a later has the least
place in it; and in this way a beginning and an end of the
world, and the path it pursues between them, is, either openly or
disguisedly, both sought for and found, and the individual who
philosophises even recognises his own position on that path. Such
historical philosophising in most cases produces a cosmogony
which admits of many varieties, or else a system of emanations,
a doctrine of successive disengagements from one being; or,
finally, driven in despair from fruitless efforts upon these paths
to the last path of all, it takes refuge in the converse doctrine of a
constant becoming, springing up, arising, coming to light out of
darkness, out of the hidden ground source or groundlessness, or
whatever other nonsense of this sort there may be, which is most
shortly disposed of with the remark that at the present moment a whole eternity, i.e., an endless time, has already passed, so
that everything that can or ought to become must have already
done so. For all such historical philosophy, whatever airs it
may give itself, regards time just as if Kant had never lived, as
a quality of the thing-in-itself, and thus stops at that which Kant
calls the phenomenon in opposition to the thing-in-itself; which
Plato calls the becoming and never being, in opposition to the
being and never becoming; and which, finally, is called in the
Indian philosophy the web of Mâya. It is just the knowledge
which belongs to the principle of sufficient reason, with which
no one can penetrate to the inner nature of things, but endlessly
pursues phenomena, moving without end or aim, like a squirrel
in its wheel, till, tired out at last, he stops at some point or
other arbitrarily chosen, and now desires to extort respect for
it from others also. The genuine philosophical consideration of
the world, i.e., the consideration that affords us a knowledge
of its inner nature, and so leads us beyond the phenomenon,
is precisely that method which does not concern itself with the
whence, the whither, and the why of the world, but always and
everywhere demands only the what; the method which considers
things not according to any relation, not as becoming and passing
away, in short, not according to one of the four forms of the
principle of sufficient reason; but, on the contrary, just that which
remains when all that belongs to the form of knowledge proper to
that principle has been abstracted, the inner nature of the world,
which always appears unchanged in all the relations, but is itself
never subject to them, and has the Ideas of the world as its object
or material. From such knowledge as this proceeds philosophy,
like art, and also, as we shall see in this book, that disposition of
mind which alone leads to true holiness and to deliverance from
the world.
