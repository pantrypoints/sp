 <!-- will, it is hoped, have conveyed the distinct and certain knowledge that  -->

The first three books explained that the world as idea is the complete mirror of the will.

 <!-- in which it knows itself in ascending grades of distinctness and completeness, the highest of which is man, whose nature, however, receives its complete expression only through the whole connected series of his actions.  -->

The self-conscious connection of these actions is made possible by reason, which enables a man constantly to survey the whole in the abstract.

The will, which, considered purely in itself, is without knowledge, and is merely a blind incessant impulse, as we see it appear in unorganised and vegetable nature and their laws, and also in the vegetative part of our own life, receives through the addition of the world as idea, which is developed in subjection to it, the knowledge of its own willing and of what it is that it wills.

This is nothing else than the world as idea, life, precisely as it exists. Therefore we called the phenomenal world the mirror of the will, its objectivity. 

Since what the will wills is always life, just because life is nothing but the representation of that willing for the idea, it is all one and a mere pleonism if, instead of simply saying “the will,” we say “the will to live.”

Will is the thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of the world. Life, the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will. Therefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow accompanies the body; and if will exists, so will life, the world, exist. Life is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long as we are filled with the will to live we need have no fear for our existence, even in the presence of death.

We see the individual come into being and pass away; but the individual is only phenomenal, exists only for the knowledge which is bound to the principle of sufficient reason, to the principio individuationis. Certainly, for this kind of knowledge, the individual receives his life as a gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers the loss of this gift through death, and returns again to nothing.

But we desire to consider life philosophically, i.e., according to its Ideas, and in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the thing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that which perceives
all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by death. 

Birth and death belong merely to the phenomenon of will, thus to life; and it is essential to this to exhibit itself in individuals which come into being and pass away, as fleeting phenomena appearing in the form of time—phenomena of that which in itself knows no time, but must exhibit itself precisely in the way we have said, in order to objectify its peculiar nature. Birth and death belong in like manner to life, and hold the balance as reciprocal conditions of each other, or, if one likes the expression, as poles of the whole phenomenon of life.

The wisest of all mythologies, the Indian, expresses this by giving to the very god that symbolises destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful and the lowest god of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming into being, and Vishnu maintaining or preserving), by giving, I say, to Siva as an attribute not only the necklace of skulls, but also the lingam, the symbol of generation, which appears here as the counterpart of death, thus signifying that generation and death are essentially correlatives, which reciprocally neutralise and annul each other.

This led the Greeks and Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights of wild
beasts, bacchanalians, &c.

Thus with representations of the full ardour of life, which they place before us not only in such revels
and sports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far as to
represent the sexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. 

The aim was to point in the most impressive manner away from the death of the mourned individual to the immortal life of nature, and thus to indicate, though without abstract knowledge, that the whole of nature is the phenomenon and also the fulfilment of the will to live. 

The form of this phenomenon is time, space, and causality, and by means of these individuation, which carries with it that the individual must come into being and pass away. 

But this no more affects the will to live, of whose manifestation the
individual is, as it were, only a particular example or specimen,
than the death of an individual injures the whole of nature.

For it is not the individual, but only the species that Nature
cares for, and for the preservation of which she so earnestly
strives, providing for it with the utmost prodigality through the
vast surplus of the seed and the great strength of the fructifying
impulse. The individual, on the contrary, neither has nor can have
any value for Nature, for her kingdom is infinite time and infinite
space, and in these infinite multiplicity of possible individuals.

Therefore she is always ready to let the individual fall, and hence
it is not only exposed to destruction in a thousand ways by the
most insignificant accident, but originally destined for it, and
conducted towards it by Nature herself from the moment it has
served its end of maintaining the species. Thus Nature naïvely
expresses the great truth that only the Ideas, not the individuals,
have, properly speaking, reality, i.e., are complete objectivity of
the will. 

Man is Nature itself at the highest grade of its self-consciousness, but Nature is only
the objectified will to live, the man who has comprehended and retained this point of view may well console himself, when
contemplating his own death and that of his friends, by turning
his eyes to the immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. 

This is the significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient
sarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the
mourning beholder, Natura non contristatur.

That generation and death are to be regarded as something
belonging to life, and essential to this phenomenon of the will,
arises also from the fact that they both exhibit themselves merely
as higher powers of the expression of that in which all the rest of life consists. This is through and through nothing else than the constant change of matter in the fixed permanence of form; 

This is what constitutes the transitoriness of the individual and the permanence of the species. 

Constant nourishment and renewal differ from generation only in degree, and constant
excretion differs only in degree from death. The first shows
itself most simply and distinctly in the plant. The plant is
throughout a constant recurrence of the same impulse of its
simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and branch. It is
a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each other,
whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to
the full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its
metamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium
of its existence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way,
to that which is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a thousand-
fold what, up till then, it effected only in the particular case—the
repetition of itself. Its earlier growth and development stands in
the same relation to its fruit as writing stands to printing. With
the animal it is clearly quite the same. The process of nourishing
is a constant reproduction; the process of reproduction is a higher
power of nourishing. The pleasure which accompanies the act of
procreation is a higher power of the agreeableness of the sense
of life. On the other hand, excretion, the constant exhalation and
throwing off of matter, is the same as that which, at a higher
power, death, is the contrary of generation. And if here we are
always content to retain the form without lamenting the discarded
matter, we ought to bear ourselves in the same way if in death
the same thing happens, in a higher degree and to the whole,
as takes place daily and hourly in a partial manner in excretion:
if we are indifferent to the one, we ought not to shrink from
the other. Therefore, from this point of view, it appears just as
perverse to desire the continuance of an individuality which will[358]
be replaced by other individuals as to desire the permanence of
matter which will be replaced by other matter. It appears just as
foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully to preserve
its excrement. As to the individual consciousness which is bound
to the individual body, it is absolutely interrupted every day by
sleep. 

Deep sleep is not different from death, into which, in fact, it often passes continuously, as in the case of freezing to death. 

It differs only with regard to the future, the awaking. 

Death is a sleep in which individuality is forgotten; everything else wakes again, or rather never slept.

The form of the phenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really only the present, not the future nor the past. The latter are only in the conception, exist only in the connection of knowledge, so far as it follows the principle of sufficient reason. 

No man has ever lived in the past, and none will live in the future; the present alone is the form of all life, and is its sure possession which
can never be taken from it. The present always exists, together
with its content. Both remain fixed without wavering, like the
rainbow on the waterfall. For life is firm and certain in the will,
and the present is firm and certain in life. Certainly, if we reflect
on the thousands of years that are past, of the millions of men [359]
who lived in them, we ask, What were they? what has become
of them? But, on the other hand, we need only recall our own
past life and renew its scenes vividly in our imagination, and
then ask again, What was all this? what has become of it? As it
is with it, so is it with the life of those millions. Or should we
suppose that the past could receive a new existence because it
has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most recent part of
it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream of
the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was?
What is? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge
free from will, which beholds it clearly in that mirror. 


<!-- 64 The following remark may assist those for whom it is not too subtle to
understand clearly that the individual is only the phenomenon, not the thing
in itself. Every individual is, on the one hand, the subject of knowing, i.e.,
the complemental condition of the possibility of the whole objective world,
and, on the other hand, a particular phenomenon of will, the same will which
objectifies itself in everything. But this double nature of our being does not rest
upon a self-existing unity, otherwise it would be possible for us to be conscious
of ourselves in ourselves, and independent of the objects of knowledge and
will. Now this is by no means possible, for as soon as we turn into ourselves
to make the attempt, and seek for once to know ourselves fully by means of
introspective reflection, we are lost in a bottomless void; we find ourselves like
the hollow glass globe, from out of which a voice speaks whose cause is not to
be found in it, and whereas we desired to comprehend ourselves, we find, with
a shudder, nothing but a vanishing spectre. -->


Whoever has not yet recognised this, or will not recognise it, must add to the question asked above as to the fate of past generations of
men this question also: Why he, the questioner, is so fortunate
as to be conscious of this costly, fleeting, and only real present,
while those hundreds of generations of men, even the heroes and
philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the past,
and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,
actually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely:

Why this now, his now, is just now and was not long ago? Since
he asks such strange questions, he regards his existence and his
time as independent of each other, and the former as projected
into the latter. He assumes indeed two nows—one which belongs
to the object, the other which belongs to the subject, and marvels
at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in truth, only
the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,
with the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient
reason as its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the
essay on the principle of sufficient reason. Now all object is the
will so far as it has become idea, and the subject is the necessary
correlative of the object.
