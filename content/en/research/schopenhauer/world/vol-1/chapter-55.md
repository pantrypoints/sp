Free will is from will being the thing-in-itself, the content of all phenomena. 

The phenomena is subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason in its 4 forms. 

Necessity is throughout identical with following from given grounds, and that these are convertible conceptions, all that belongs to the phenomenon, i.e., all that is object for the knowing subject as individual, is in one aspect reason, and in another aspect consequent.

In this last capacity is determined with absolute necessity, and can, therefore, in no respect be other than it is. The whole content of Nature, the collective sum of its phenomena, is thus throughout necessary, and the necessity of every part, of every phenomenon, of every event, can always be proved, because it must be possible to find the reason from which it follows as a consequent. This admits of no exception: it follows from the unrestricted validity of the principle of sufficient reason.

In another aspect, however,
the same world is for us, in all its phenomena, objectivity of
will. And the will, since it is not phenomenon, is not idea or
object, but thing-in-itself, and is not subordinate to the principle
of sufficient reason, the form of all object; thus is not determined
as a consequent through any reason, knows no necessity, i.e., is
free. The concept of freedom is thus properly a negative concept,[370]
for its content is merely the denial of necessity, i.e., the relation of
consequent to its reason, according to the principle of sufficient
reason. Now here lies before us in its most distinct form the
solution of that great contradiction, the union of freedom with
necessity, which has so often been discussed in recent times, yet,
so far as I know, never clearly and adequately. 

Everything is
as phenomenon, as object, absolutely necessary: in itself it is
will, which is perfectly free to all eternity. The phenomenon, the
object, is necessarily and unalterably determined in that chain
of causes and effects which admits of no interruption. But the
existence in general of this object, and its specific nature, i.e., the
Idea which reveals itself in it, or, in other words, its character,
is a direct manifestation of will. Thus, in conformity with the
freedom of this will, the object might not be at all, or it might be
originally and essentially something quite different from what it
is, in which case, however, the whole chain of which it is a link,
and which is itself a manifestation of the same will, would be
quite different also. But once there and existing, it has entered
the chain of causes and effects, is always necessarily determined
in it, and can, therefore, neither become something else, i.e., change itself, nor yet escape from the chain, i.e., vanish. Man,
like every other part of Nature, is objectivity of the will; therefore
all that has been said holds good of him. 

As everything in Nature
has its forces and qualities, which react in a definite way when
definitely affected, and constitute its character, man also has his
character, from which the motives call forth his actions with
necessity. In this manner of conduct his empirical character
reveals itself, but in this again his intelligible character, the will
in itself, whose determined phenomenon he is. But man is the
most complete phenomenon of will, and, as we explained in the
Second Book, he had to be enlightened with so high a degree
of knowledge in order to maintain himself in existence, that in 
it a perfectly adequate copy or repetition of the nature of the
world under the form of the idea became possible: this is the
comprehension of the Ideas, the pure mirror of the world, as we learnt in Book 3. 

Thus in man the will can attain to
full self-consciousness, to distinct and exhaustive knowledge of
its own nature, as it mirrors itself in the whole world. We saw
in the preceding book that art springs from the actual presence
of this degree of knowledge; and at the end of our whole work
it will further appear that, through the same knowledge, in that
the will relates it to itself, a suppression and self-denial of the
will in its most perfect manifestation is possible. So that the
freedom which otherwise, as belonging to the thing-in-itself,
can never show itself in the phenomenon, in such a case does
also appear in it, and, by abolishing the nature which lies at
the foundation of the phenomenon, while the latter itself still
continues to exist in time, it brings about a contradiction of the
phenomenon with itself, and in this way exhibits the phenomena
of holiness and self-renunciation. But all this can only be
fully understood at the end of this book. What has just been said
merely affords a preliminary and general indication of how man is
distinguished from all the other phenomena of will by the fact that
freedom, i.e., independence of the principle of sufficient reason, which only belongs to the will as thing-in-itself, and contradicts
the phenomenon, may yet possibly, in his case, appear in the
phenomenon also, where, however, it necessarily exhibits itself
as a contradiction of the phenomenon with itself. In this sense,
not only the will in itself, but man also may certainly be called
free, and thus distinguished from all other beings. 

But how this
is to be understood can only become clear through all that is to
follow, and for the present we must turn away from it altogether.
For, in the first place, we must beware of the error that the action
of the individual definite man is subject to no necessity, i.e.,[372]
that the power of the motive is less certain than the power of
the cause, or the following of the conclusion from the premises.
