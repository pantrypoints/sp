This freedom, this omnipotence, as the expression
of which the whole visible world exists and progressively
develops in accordance with the laws which belong to the
form of knowledge, can now, at the point at which in its most
perfect manifestation it has attained to the completely adequate
knowledge of its own nature, express itself anew in two ways.

Either it wills here, at the summit of mental endowment and self-consciousness, simply what it willed before blindly and unconsciously, and if so, knowledge always remains its motive in the whole as in the particular case. Or, conversely, this knowledge becomes for it a quieter, which appeases and suppresses all willing. 

This is that assertion and denial of the will to live which was stated above in general terms. As, in the reference of individual conduct, a general, not a particular manifestation of will, it does not disturb and modify the development of the character, nor does it find its expression in particular actions; but, either by an ever more marked appearance of the whole method of action it has followed hitherto, or conversely by the entire suppression of it, it expresses in a living form the maxims which the will has freely adopted in accordance with the knowledge it has now attained to. By the explanations we have just given of freedom, necessity, and character, we have somewhat facilitated and prepared the way for the clearer development of all this, which is the principal subject of this last book.

But we shall have done so still more when we have turned our attention to life itself, the willing or not willing of which is the great question, and have endeavoured to find out generally what the will itself, which is everywhere the inmost nature of this life, will really attain by its assertion—in what way and to what extent this assertion satisfies or can satisfy the will; in short, what is generally and mainly to be regarded as its position in this its own world, which in every relation belongs to it.

I wish the reader to recall the passage with which we closed the Second Book,—a passage occasioned by the question, which met us then, as to the end and aim of the will. Instead of the answer to this question, it appeared clearly before us how, in all the grades of its manifestation, from the lowest to the highest, the will dispenses altogether with a final goal and aim. It always strives, for striving is its sole nature, which no attained goal can put an end to. Therefore it is not susceptible of any final satisfaction, but can only be restrained by hindrances, while in itself it goes on for ever. We see this in the simplest of all natural phenomena, gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards a mathematical centre to reach which would be the annihilation both of itself and matter, and would not cease even if the whole universe were already rolled into one ball.

We see it in the other simple natural phenomena. A solid tends towards fluidity either by melting or dissolving, for only so will its chemical forces be free; rigidity is the imprisonment in which it is held by cold. The fluid tends towards the gaseous state, into which it passes at once as soon as all pressure is removed from it. No body is without relationship, i.e., without tendency or without desire and longing, as Jacob Böhme would say.

Electricity transmits its inner self-repulsion to infinity, though
the mass of the earth absorbs the effect. Galvanism is certainly,
so long as the pile is working, an aimless, unceasingly repeated
act of repulsion and attraction. The existence of the plant is just
such a restless, never satisfied striving, a ceaseless tendency 
through ever-ascending forms, till the end, the seed, becomes a new starting-point; and this repeated ad infinitum—nowhere an
end, nowhere a final satisfaction, nowhere a resting-place. 

It will
also be remembered, from the Second Book, that the multitude
of natural forces and organised forms everywhere strive with
each other for the matter in which they desire to appear, for
each of them only possesses what it has wrested from the others;
and thus a constant internecine war is waged, from which, for
the most part, arises the resistance through which that striving,
which constitutes the inner nature of everything, is at all points
hindered; struggles in vain, yet, from its nature, cannot leave
off; toils on laboriously till this phenomenon dies, when others
eagerly seize its place and its matter.

We have long since recognised this striving, which constitutes
the kernel and in-itself of everything, as identical with that which
in us, where it manifests itself most distinctly in the light of
the fullest consciousness, is called will. Its hindrance through
an obstacle which places itself between it and its temporary aim
we call suffering, and, on the other hand, its attainment of the
end satisfaction, wellbeing, happiness. We may also transfer
this terminology to the phenomena of the unconscious world,
for though weaker in degree, they are identical in nature. Then
we see them involved in constant suffering, and without any
continuing happiness. For all effort springs from defect—from
discontent with one's estate—is thus suffering so long as it is
not satisfied; but no satisfaction is lasting, rather it is always
merely the starting-point of a new effort. The striving we see
everywhere hindered in many ways, everywhere in conflict, and
therefore always under the form of suffering. Thus, if there is no
final end of striving, there is no measure and end of suffering.

But what we only discover in unconscious Nature by sharpened
observation, and with an effort, presents itself distinctly to us
in the intelligent world in the life of animals, whose constant
suffering is easily proved. But without lingering over these
intermediate grades, we shall turn to the life of man, in which all this appears with the greatest distinctness, illuminated by the
clearest knowledge; for as the phenomenon of will becomes more
complete, the suffering also becomes more and more apparent.
In the plant there is as yet no sensibility, and therefore no pain.
A certain very small degree of suffering is experienced by the
lowest species of animal life—infusoria and radiata; even in
insects the capacity to feel and suffer is still limited. It first
appears in a high degree with the complete nervous system of
vertebrate animals, and always in a higher degree the more
intelligence develops. Thus, in proportion as knowledge attains
to distinctness, as consciousness ascends, pain also increases, and
therefore reaches its highest degree in man. And then, again, the
more distinctly a man knows, the more intelligent he is, the more
pain he has; the man who is gifted with genius suffers most of all.
In this sense, that is, with reference to the degree of knowledge in
general, not mere abstract rational knowledge, I understand and
use here that saying of the Preacher: Qui auget scientiam, auget
at dolorem. That philosophical painter or painting philosopher,
Tischbein, has very beautifully expressed the accurate relation
between the degree of consciousness and that of suffering by
exhibiting it in a visible and clear form in a drawing. The upper
half of his drawing represents women whose children have been
stolen, and who in different groups and attitudes, express in many
ways deep maternal pain, anguish, and despair. The lower half
of the drawing represents sheep whose lambs have been taken
away. They are arranged and grouped in precisely the same way;
so that every human head, every human attitude of the upper
half, has below a brute head and attitude corresponding to it.
Thus we see distinctly how the pain which is possible in the
dull brute consciousness is related to the violent grief, which [401]
only becomes possible through distinctness of knowledge and
clearness of consciousness.

We desire to consider in this way, in human existence, the inner
and essential destiny of will. Every one will easily recognise that same destiny expressed in various degrees in the life of the
brutes, only more weakly, and may also convince himself to his
own satisfaction, from the suffering animal world, how essential
to all life is suffering.
