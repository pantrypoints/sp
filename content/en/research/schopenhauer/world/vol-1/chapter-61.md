Book 2 wrote that in the whole of nature, at all the grades of the objectification of
will, there was a necessary and constant conflict between the
individuals of all species; and in this way was expressed the
inner contradiction of the will to live with itself. 

At the highest grade of the objectification, this phenomenon, like all others, will exhibit itself with greater distinctness, and will therefore be more easily explained. With this aim we shall next attempt to trace the source of egoism as the starting-point of all conflict. 

We have called time and space the principium individuationis, because only through them and in them is multiplicity of the homogeneous possible. 

They are the essential forms of natural knowledge, i.e., knowledge springing from the will. Therefore the
will everywhere manifests itself in the multiplicity of individuals.
But this multiplicity does not concern the will as thing-in-itself,
but only its phenomena. The will itself is present, whole and
undivided, in every one of these, and beholds around it the
innumerably repeated image of its own nature; but this nature
itself, the actually real, it finds directly only in its inner self.
Therefore every one desires everything for himself, desires to
possess, or at least to control, everything, and whatever opposes
it it would like to destroy. 

To this is added, in the case of such beings as have knowledge, that the individual is the supporter of the knowing subject, and the knowing subject is the supporter of the world, i.e., that the whole of Nature outside the knowing subject, and thus also all other individuals, exist only in its idea; it is only conscious of them as its idea, thus merely indirectly as something which is dependent on its own nature and existence; for with its consciousness the world necessarily disappears for it, i.e., its being and non-being become synonymous and indistinguishable.

Every knowing individual is thus in truth, and finds itself as the whole will to live, or the inner being of the world itself, and also as the complemental condition of the world as idea, consequently as a microcosm which is of equal value with the macrocosm. Nature itself, which is everywhere and always truthful, gives him this knowledge, originally and independently of all reflection, with simple and direct certainty.

These 2 necessary properties explain that every individual, though vanishing altogether and diminished to nothing in the boundless world, yet makes itself the centre of the world, has regard for its own existence and well-being before everything else.

From the natural standpoint, is ready to sacrifice everything else for this—is ready to annihilate the world in order to maintain its own self, this drop in the ocean, a little longer.

This disposition is egoism, which is essential to everything in Nature. Yet it is just through egoism that the inner conflict of the will with itself attains to such a terrible revelation; for this egoism has its continuance and being in that opposition of the microcosm and macrocosm, or in the fact that the objectification of will has the principium individuationis for its form, through which the will manifests itself in the same way in innumerable individuals, and indeed entire and completely in both aspects (will and idea) in each.

Thus, while each individual is given to
itself directly as the whole will and the whole subject of ideas, other individuals are only given it as ideas. Therefore its own
being, and the maintenance of it, is of more importance to it than
that of all others together. Every one looks upon his own death as upon the end of the world, while he accepts the death of his
acquaintances as a matter of comparative indifference, if he is not
in some way affected by it. 

In the consciousness that has reached
the highest grade, that of man, egoism, as well as knowledge,
pain and pleasure, must have reached its highest grade also, and
the conflict of individuals which is conditioned by it must appear
in its most terrible form. And indeed we see this everywhere
before our eyes, in small things as in great. Now we see its
terrible side in the lives of great tyrants and miscreants, and in
world-desolating wars; now its absurd side, in which it is the
theme of comedy, and very specially appears as self-conceit and
vanity. Rochefoucault understood this better than any one else,
and presented it in the abstract. 

We see it both in the history of the
world and in our own experience. But it appears most distinctly
of all when any mob of men is set free from all law and order;
then there shows itself at once in the distinctest form the bellum
omnium contra omnes, which Hobbes has so admirably described
in the first chapter De Cive. We see not only how every one tries
to seize from the other what he wants himself, but how often one
will destroy the whole happiness or life of another for the sake of
an insignificant addition to his own happiness. This is the highest
expression of egoism, the manifestations of which in this regard
are only surpassed by those of actual wickedness, which seeks,
quite disinterestedly, the hurt and suffering of others, without
any advantage to itself. Of this we shall speak soon. With this
exhibition of the source of egoism the reader should compare the
presentation of it in my prize-essay on the basis of morals, § 14.
A chief source of that suffering which we found above to [430]
be essential and inevitable to all life is, when it really appears
in a definite form, that Eris, the conflict of all individuals, the
expression of the contradiction, with which the will to live is
affected in its inner self, and which attains a visible form through
the principium individuationis. Wild-beast fights are the most
cruel means of showing this directly and vividly. 

In this original discord lies an unquenchable source of suffering, in spite of the
precautions that have been taken against it, and which we shall
now consider more closely.
