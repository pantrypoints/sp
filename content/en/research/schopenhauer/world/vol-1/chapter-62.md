The first and simplest assertion of the will to live is only the assertion of one's own
body, i.e., the exhibition of the will through acts in time, so far as
the body, in its form and design, exhibits the same will in space,
and no further. 

This assertion shows itself as maintenance of the
body, by means of the application of its own powers. To it is
directly related the satisfaction of the sexual impulse; indeed this
belongs to it, because the genitals belong to the body. Therefore
voluntary renunciation of the satisfaction of that impulse, based
upon no motive, is already a denial of the will to live, is a voluntary
self-suppression of it, upon the entrance of knowledge which acts
as a quieter. 

Accordingly such denial of one's own body exhibits
itself as a contradiction by the will of its own phenomenon. For
although here also the body objectifies in the genitals the will to
perpetuate the species, yet this is not willed. Just on this account,
because it is a denial or suppression of the will to live, such a
renunciation is a hard and painful self-conquest; but of this later.

But since the will exhibits that self-assertion of one's own body in
innumerable individuals beside each other, it very easily extends
in one individual, on account of the egoism peculiar to them all,
beyond this assertion to the denial of the same will appearing
in another individual. The will of the first breaks through the
limits of the assertion of will of another, because the individual
either destroys or injures this other body itself, or else because[431]
it compels the powers of the other body to serve its own will,
instead of the will which manifests itself in that other body. Thus
if, from the will manifesting itself as another body, it withdraws
the powers of this body, and so increases the power serving its
own will beyond that of its own body, it consequently asserts its
own will beyond its own body by means of the negation of the
will appearing in another body. 

This breaking through the limits of the assertion of will of another has always been distinctly
recognised, and its concept denoted by the word wrong. For both
sides recognise the fact instantly, not, indeed, as we do here in
distinct abstraction, but as feeling. He who suffers wrong feels
the transgression into the sphere of the assertion of his own body,
through the denial of it by another individual, as a direct and
mental pain which is entirely separated and different from the
accompanying physical suffering experienced from the act or the
vexation at the loss. To the doer of wrong, on the other hand,
the knowledge presents itself that he is in himself the same will
which appears in that body also, and which asserts itself with
such vehemence; the one phenomenon that, transgressing the
limits of its own body and its powers, it extends to the denial of
this very will in another phenomenon, and so, regarded as will in
itself, it strives against itself by this vehemence and rends itself.
Moreover, this knowledge presents itself to him instantly, not in
abstracto, but as an obscure feeling; and this is called remorse,
or, more accurately in this case, the feeling of wrong committed.
Wrong, the conception of which we have thus analysed in its
most general and abstract form, expresses itself in the concrete
most completely, peculiarly, and palpably in cannibalism. 

This
is its most distinct and evident type, the terrible picture of the
greatest conflict of the will with itself at the highest grade of its
objectification, which is man. Next to this, it expresses itself
most distinctly in murder; and therefore the committal of murder is followed instantly and with fearful distinctness by remorse,
the abstract and dry significance of which we have just given,
which inflicts a wound on our peace of mind that a lifetime
cannot heal. For our horror at the murder committed, as also our
shrinking from the committal of it, corresponds to that infinite
clinging to life with which everything living, as phenomenon
of the will to live, is penetrated. (We shall analyse this feeling
which accompanies the doing of wrong and evil, in other words,
the pangs of conscience, more fully later on, and raise its concept to distinctness.) Mutilation, or mere injury of another body,
indeed every blow, is to be regarded as in its nature the same
as murder, and differing from it only in degree. 

Wrong shows itself in the subjugation of another individual, in forcing him into slavery, and, finally, in the seizure of another's goods, which, so far as these goods are regarded as the fruit of his labour, is just the same thing as making him a slave, and is related to this as mere injury is to murder.

For property, which is not taken from a man without wrong,
can, according to our explanation of wrong, only be that which
has been produced by his own powers. Therefore by taking this
we really take the powers of his body from the will objectified in
it, to make them subject to the will objectified in another body.
For only so does the wrong-doer, by seizing, not the body of
another, but a lifeless thing quite different from it, break into
the sphere of the assertion of will of another person, because the
powers, the work of this other body, are, as it were, incorporated
and identified with this thing. It follows from this that all true,
i.e., moral, right of property is based simply and solely on work,
as was pretty generally assumed before Kant, and is distinctly and
beautifully expressed in the oldest of all codes of law: “Wise men
who know the past explain that a cultured field is the property
of him who cut down the wood and cleared and ploughed it,[433]
as an antelope belongs to the first hunter who mortally wounds
it” (Laws of Manu, ix. 44). Kant's philosophy of law is an
extraordinary concatenation of errors all leading to each other,
and he bases the right of property upon first occupation. To me
this is only explicable on the supposition that his powers were
failing through old age. For how should the mere avowal of my
will to exclude others from the use of a thing at once give me a
right to it? Clearly such an avowal itself requires a foundation of
right, instead of being one, as Kant assumes. And how would he
act unjustly in se, i.e., morally, who does not respect that claim
to the sole possession of a thing which is based upon nothing but its own avowal? How should his conscience trouble him about
it? For it is so clear and easy to understand that there can be
absolutely no such thing as a just seizure of anything, but only a
just conversion or acquired possession of it, by spending our own
original powers upon it. When, by any foreign labour, however
little, a thing has been cultivated, improved, kept from harm or
preserved, even if this labour were only the plucking or picking
up from the ground of fruit that has grown wild; the person who
forcibly seizes such a thing clearly deprives the other of the result
of his labour expended upon it, makes the body of this other
serve his will instead of its own, asserts his will beyond its own
phenomenon to the denial of that of the other, i.e., does injustice
or wrong.74 On the other hand, the mere enjoyment of a thing,
without any cultivation or preservation of it from destruction,
gives just as little right to it as the mere avowal of our desire for
its sole possession. Therefore, though one family has hunted a
district alone, even for a hundred years, but has done nothing for [434]
its improvement; if a stranger comes and desires to hunt there,
it cannot prevent him from doing so without moral injustice.
Thus the so-called right of preoccupation, according to which,
for the mere past enjoyment of a thing, there is demanded the
further recompense of the exclusive right to its future enjoyment,
is morally entirely without foundation. A new-comer might with
far better right reply to him who was depending upon such a
right, “Just because you have so long enjoyed, it is right that
others should now enjoy also.” No moral right can be established
to the sole possession of anything upon which labour cannot be
expended, either in improving it or in preserving it from harm,
unless it be through a voluntary surrender on the part of others, as
74 Thus the basis of natural right of property does not require the assumption
of two grounds of right beside each other, that based on detention and that
based on formation; but the latter is itself sufficient. Only the name formation
is not very suitable, for the spending of any labour upon a thing does not need
to be a forming or fashioning of it.
432 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
a reward for other services. This, however, already presupposes
a community regulated by agreement—the State. The morally
established right of property, as we have deduced it above, gives,
from its nature, to the owner of a thing, the same unlimited power
over it which he has over his own body; and hence it follows that
he can part with his possessions to others either in exchange or
as a gift, and they then possess them with the same moral right
as he did.

As regards the doing of wrong generally, it occurs either
through violence or through craft; it matters not which as far
as what is morally essential is concerned. First, in the case of
murder, it is a matter of indifference whether I make use of
a dagger or of poison; and the case of every bodily injury is
analogous. Other cases of wrong can all be reduced to the fact
that I, as the doer of wrong, compel another individual to serve
my will instead of his own, to act according to my will instead
of according to his own. On the path of violence I attain this end
through physical causality, but on the path of craft by means of
motivation, i.e., by means of causality through knowledge; for
I present to his will illusive motives, on account of which he[435]
follows my will, while he believes he is following his own. Since
the medium in which the motives lie is knowledge, I can only
accomplish this by falsifying his knowledge, and this is the lie.
The lie always aims at influencing another's will, not merely his
knowledge, for itself and as such, but only as a means, so far as it
determines his will. For my lying itself, inasmuch as it proceeds
from my will, requires a motive; and only the will of another
can be such a motive, not his knowledge in and for itself; for
as such it can never have an influence upon my will, therefore it
can never move it, can never be a motive of its aim. But only
the willing and doing of another can be this, and his knowledge
indirectly through it. This holds good not only of all lies that
have manifestly sprung from self-interest, but also of those which
proceed from pure wickedness, which seeks enjoyment in the painful consequences of the error into which it has led another.

Mere empty boasting aims at influencing the will and
action of others more or less, by increasing their respect or
improving their opinion of the boaster. The mere refusal of a
truth, i.e., of an assertion generally, is in itself no wrong, but
every imposing of a lie is certainly a wrong. He who refuses to
show the strayed traveller the right road does him no wrong, but
he who directs him to a false road certainly does. It follows from
what has been said, that every lie, like every act of violence, is
as such wrong, because as such it has for its aim the extension of
the authority of my will to other individuals, and so the assertion
of my will through the denial of theirs, just as much as violence
has. But the most complete lie is the broken contract, because
here all the conditions mentioned are completely and distinctly
present together. For when I enter into a contract, the promised
performance of the other individual is directly and confessedly
the motive for my reciprocal performance. The promises were
deliberately and formally exchanged. The fulfilment of the [436]
declarations made is, it is assumed, in the power of each. If
the other breaks the covenant, he has deceived me, and by
introducing merely illusory motives into my knowledge, he has
bent my will according to his intention; he has extended the
control of his will to another individual, and thus has committed
a distinct wrong. On this is founded the moral lawfulness and
validity of the contract.

Wrong through violence is not so shameful to the doer of
it as wrong through craft; for the former arises from physical
power, which under all circumstances impresses mankind; while
the latter, by the use of subterfuge, betrays weakness, and lowers
man at once as a physical and moral being. This is further the
case because lying and deception can only succeed if he who
employs them expresses at the same time horror and contempt of
them in order to win confidence, and his victory rests on the fact
that men credit him with honesty which he does not possess. 

The deep horror which is always excited by cunning, faithlessness,
and treachery rests on the fact that good faith and honesty are
the bond which externally binds into a unity the will which has
been broken up into the multiplicity of individuals, and thereby
limits the consequences of the egoism which results from that
dispersion. Faithlessness and treachery break this outward bond
asunder, and thus give boundless scope to the consequences of
egoism.

In the connection of our system we have found that the
content of the concept of wrong is that quality of the conduct
of an individual in which he extends the assertion of the will
appearing in his own body so far that it becomes the denial of
the will appearing in the bodies of others. We have also laid
down, by means of very general examples, the limits at which
the province of wrong begins; for we have at once defined its
gradations, from the highest degree to the lowest, by means of
a few leading conceptions. According to this, the concept of[437]
wrong is the original and positive, and the concept of right,
which is opposed to it, is the derivative and negative; for we
must keep to the concepts, and not to the words. As a matter
of fact, there would be no talk of right if there were no such
thing as wrong. The concept right contains merely the negation
of wrong, and every action is subsumed under it which does
not transgress the limit laid down above, i.e., is not a denial of
the will of another for the stronger assertion of our own. That
limit, therefore, divides, as regards a purely moral definition,
the whole province of possible actions into such as are wrong
or right. Whenever an action does not encroach, in the way
explained above, on the sphere of the assertion of will of another,
denying it, it is not wrong. Therefore, for example, the refusal
of help to another in great need, the quiet contemplation of the
death of another from starvation while we ourselves have more
than enough, is certainly cruel and fiendish, but it is not wrong;
only it can be affirmed with certainty that whoever is capable of carrying unkindness and hardness to such a degree will certainly
also commit every wrong whenever his wishes demand it and no
compulsion prevents it.

But the conception of right as the negation of wrong finds its
principal application, and no doubt its origin, in cases in which
an attempted wrong by violence is warded off. This warding off
cannot itself be wrong, and consequently is right, although the
violence it requires, regarded in itself and in isolation, would be
wrong, and is here only justified by the motive, i.e., becomes
right. If an individual goes so far in the assertion of his own will
that he encroaches upon the assertion of will which is essential
to my person as such, and denies it, then my warding off of that
encroachment is only the denial of that denial, and thus from
my side is nothing more than the assertion of the will which
essentially and originally appears in my body, and is already
implicitly expressed by the mere appearance of this body; 

Consequently is not wrong, but right. That is to say: I have then
a right to deny that denial of another with the force necessary to
overcome it, and it is easy to see that this may extend to the killing
of the other individual, whose encroachment as external violence
pressing upon me may be warded off by a somewhat stronger
counteraction, entirely without wrong, consequently with right.
For all that happens from my side lies always within the sphere of
the assertion of will essential to my person as such, and already
expressed by it (which is the scene of the conflict), and does not
encroach on that of the other, consequently is only negation of
the negation, and thus affirmation, not itself negation. Thus if
the will of another denies my will, as this appears in my body
and the use of its powers for its maintenance, without denial of
any foreign will which observes a like limitation, I can without
wrong compel it to desist from such denial, i.e., I have so far a
right of compulsion.

In all cases in which I have a right of compulsion, a complete
right to use violence against another, I may, according to the circumstances, just as well oppose the violence of the other with
craft without doing any wrong, and accordingly I have an actual
right to lie precisely so far as I have a right of compulsion.
Therefore a man acts with perfect right who assures a highway
robber who is searching him that he has nothing more upon him;
or, if a burglar has broken into his house by night, induces him
by a lie to enter a cellar and then locks him in. A man who
has been captured and carried off by robbers, for example by
pirates, has the right to kill them not only by violence but also
by craft, in order to regain his freedom. Thus, also, a promise is
certainly not binding when it has been extorted by direct bodily
violence, because he who suffers such compulsion may with full
right free himself by killing, and, a fortiori, by deceiving his
oppressor. Whoever cannot recover through force the property
which has been stolen from him, commits no wrong if he can[439]
accomplish it through craft. Indeed, if some one plays with
me for money he has stolen from me, I have the right to use
false dice against him, because all that I win from him already
belongs to me. 

Whoever would deny this must still more deny
the justifiableness of stratagem in war, which is just an acted lie,
and is a proof of the saying of Queen Christina of Sweden, “The
words of men are to be esteemed as nothing; scarcely are their
deeds to be trusted.” So sharply does the limit of right border
upon that of wrong. For the rest, I regard it as superfluous to show
that all this completely agrees with what was said above about
the unlawfulness of the lie and of violence. It may also serve to
explain the peculiar theory of the lie told under pressure.75
In accordance with what has been said, wrong and right are
merely moral determinations, i.e., such as are valid with regard
to the consideration of human action as such, and in relation to
the inner significance of this action in itself. This asserts itself

<!-- 75 The further exposition of the philosophy of law here laid down will be
found in my prize-essay, “Ueber das Fundament der Moral,” § 17, pp. 221-230
of 1st ed., pp. 216-226 of 2d ed. -->

directly in consciousness through the fact that the doing of wrong
is accompanied by an inward pain, which is the merely felt
consciousness of the wrong-doer of the excessive strength of the
assertion of will in itself, which extends even to the denial of the
manifestation of the will of another, and also the consciousness
that although he is different from the person suffering wrong as
far as the manifestation is concerned, yet in himself he is identical
with him. The further explanation of this inner significance of
all pain of conscience cannot be given till later. He who suffers
wrong is, on the other hand, painfully conscious of the denial
of his will, as it is expressed through the body and its natural
requirements, for the satisfaction of which nature refers him to
the powers of his body; and at the same time he is conscious [440]
that without doing wrong he might ward off that denial by every
means unless he lacks the power. 

This purely moral significance
is the only one which right and wrong have for men as men,
not as members of the State, and which consequently remains
even when man is in a state of nature without any positive law.
It constitutes the basis and the content of all that has on this
account been named natural law, though it is better called moral
law, for its validity does not extend to suffering, to the external
reality, but only to the action of man and the self-knowledge
of his individual will which grows up in him from his action,
and which is called conscience. It cannot, however, in a state
of nature, assert itself in all cases, and outwardly upon other
individuals, and prevent might from reigning instead of right. In
a state of nature it depends upon every one merely to see that
in every case he does no wrong, but by no means to see that in
every case he suffers no wrong, for this depends on the accident
of his outward power. Therefore the concepts right and wrong,
even in a state of nature, are certainly valid and by no means
conventional, but there they are valid merely as moral concepts,
for the self-knowledge of one's own will in each. They are a
fixed point in the scale of the very different degrees of strength
438 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
with which the will to live asserts itself in human individuals,
like the freezing-point on the thermometer; the point at which
the assertion of one's own will becomes the denial of the will
of another, i.e., specifies through wrong-doing the degree of
its intensity, combined with the degree in which knowledge is
involved in the principium individuationis (which is the form of
all knowledge that is subject to the will). But whoever wants
to set aside the purely moral consideration of human action, or
denies it, and wishes to regard conduct merely in its outward
effects and their consequences, may certainly, with Hobbes,
explain right and wrong as conventional definitions arbitrarily
assumed, and therefore not existing outside positive law, and[441]
we can never show him through external experience what does
not belong to such experience. Hobbes himself characterises his
completely empirical method of thought very remarkably by the
fact that in his book “De Principiis Geometrarum” he denies all
pure mathematics properly so called, and obstinately maintains
that the point has extension and the line has breadth, and we
can never show him a point without extension or a line without
breadth. Thus we can just as little impart to him the a priori
nature of mathematics as the a priori nature of right, because he
shuts himself out from all knowledge which is not empirical.
The pure doctrine of right is thus a chapter of ethics, and
is directly related only to action, not to suffering; for only the
former is the expression of will, and this alone is considered
by ethics. Suffering is mere occurrence. Ethics can only have
regard to suffering indirectly, merely to show that what takes
place merely to avoid suffering wrong is itself no infliction of
wrong. The working out of this chapter of ethics would contain
the precise definition of the limits to which an individual may go
in the assertion of the will already objectified in his body without
denying the same will as it appears in another individual; and also
the actions which transgress these limits, which consequently are
wrong, and therefore in their turn may be warded off without wrong. Thus our own action always remains the point of view of
the investigation.

But the suffering of wrong appears as an event in outward
experience, and in it is manifested, as we have said, more
distinctly than anywhere else, the phenomenon of the conflict
of the will to live with itself, arising from the multiplicity of
individuals and from egoism, both of which are conditioned
through the principium individuationis, which is the form of the
world as idea for the knowledge of the individual. We also saw
above that a very large part of the suffering essential to human [442]
life has its perennial source in that conflict of individuals.
The reason, however, which is common to all these
individuals, and which enables them to know not merely the
particular case, as the brutes do, but also the whole abstractly in
its connection, has also taught them to discern the source of that
suffering, and induced them to consider the means of diminishing
it, or, when possible, of suppressing it by a common sacrifice,
which is, however, more than counterbalanced by the common
advantage that proceeds from it. However agreeable it is to
the egoism of the individual to inflict wrong in particular cases,
this has yet a necessary correlative in the suffering of wrong
of another individual, to whom it is a great pain. And because
the reason which surveys the whole left the one-sided point of
view of the individual to which it belongs, and freed itself for
the moment from its dependence upon it, it saw the pleasure
of an individual in inflicting wrong always outweighed by the
relatively greater pain of the other who suffered the wrong; and
it found further, that because here everything was left to chance,
every one had to fear that the pleasure of conveniently inflicting
wrong would far more rarely fall to his lot than the pain of
enduring it. From this reason recognised that both in order to
diminish the suffering which is everywhere disseminated, and
as far as possible to divide it equally, the best and only means
was to spare all the pain of suffering wrong by renouncing all
440 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the pleasure to be obtained by inflicting it. This means is the
contract of the state or law. It is easily conceived, and little by
little carried out by the egoism, which, through the use of reason,
proceeds methodically and forsakes its one-sided point of view.
This origin of the state and of law I have indicated was already
exhibited as such by Plato in the “Republic.” In fact, it is the
essential and only origin, determined by the nature of the matter.
Moreover, in no land can the state have ever had a different[443]
origin, because it is just this mode of originating this aim that
makes it a state. But it is a matter of indifference whether, in each
particular nation, the condition which preceded it was that of a
horde of savages independent of each other (anarchy), or that of
a horde of slaves ruled at will by the stronger (despotism). In
both cases there existed as yet no state; it first arose through that
common agreement; and according as that agreement is more or
less free from anarchy or despotism, the state is more or less
perfect. Republics tend to anarchy, monarchies to despotism,
and the mean of constitutional monarchy, which was therefore
devised, tends to government by factions. In order to found a
perfect state, we must begin by providing beings whose nature
allows them always to sacrifice their own to the public good. Till
then, however, something may be attained through the existence
of one family whose good is quite inseparable from that of the
country; so that, at least in matters of importance, it can never
advance the one without the other. On this rests the power and
the advantage of the hereditary monarchy.


As ethics was concerned exclusively with right and
wrong doing, and could accurately point out the limits of his
action to whoever was resolved to do no wrong; politics, on
the contrary, the theory of legislation, is exclusively concerned
with the suffering of wrong, and would never trouble itself with
wrong-doing at all if it were not on account of its ever-necessary
correlative, the suffering of wrong, which it always keeps in view
as the enemy it opposes. Indeed, if it were possible to conceive
441
an infliction of wrong with which no suffering of wrong on the
part of another was connected, the state would, consistently,
by no means prohibit it. And because in ethics the will, the
disposition, is the object of consideration, and the only real thing,
the firm will to do wrong, which is only restrained and rendered [444]
ineffective by external might, and the actually committed wrong,
are to it quite the same, and it condemns him who so wills as
unjust at its tribunal. On the other hand, will and disposition,
merely as such, do not concern the state at all, but only the deed
(whether it is merely attempted or carried out), on account of
its correlative, the suffering on the part of another. Thus for the
state the deed, the event, is the only real; the disposition, the
intention, is only investigated so far as the significance of the
deed becomes known through it. Therefore the state will forbid
no one to carry about in his thought murder and poison against
another, so long as it knows certainly that the fear of the sword
and the wheel will always restrain the effects of that will. The
state has also by no means to eradicate the foolish purpose, the
inclination to wrong-doing, the wicked disposition; but merely
always to place beside every possible motive for doing a wrong
a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the inevitable
punishment that will ensue. Therefore the criminal code is as
complete a register as possible of motives against every criminal
action that can possibly be imagined—both in abstracto, in order
to make any case that occurs an application in concreto. Politics
or legislation will therefore for this end borrow from that chapter
of ethics which is the doctrine of right, and which, besides the
inner significance of right and wrong, determines the exact limits
between them. Yet it will only do so for the purpose of making
use of its reverse side, and regarding all the limits which ethics
lays down as not to be transgressed, if we are to avoid doing
wrong, from the other side, as the limits which we must not
allow others to transgress if we do not wish to suffer wrong,
and from which we have therefore a right to drive others back.

Therefore these limits are, as much as possible, from the passive
side, barricaded by laws. It is evident that as an historian has very
wittily been called an inverted prophet, the professor of law is an[445]
inverted moralist, and therefore law itself, in its proper sense, i.e.,
the doctrine of the right, which we ought to maintain, is inverted
ethics in that chapter of it in which the rights are laid down which
we ought not to violate. The concept of wrong and its negation,
that of right, which is originally ethical, becomes juridical by the
transference of the starting-point from the active to the passive
side, and thus by inversion. This, as well as Kant's theory of
law, which very falsely deduces the institution of the state as
a moral duty from his categorical imperative, has, even in the
most recent times, repeatedly occasioned the very extraordinary
error that the state is an institution for furthering morality; that
it arises from the endeavour after this, and is, consequently,
directed against egoism. As if the inward disposition, to which
alone morality or immorality belongs, the externally free will,
would allow itself to be modified from without and changed by
influences exerted upon it! Still more perverse is the theory that
the state is the condition of freedom in the moral sense, and in
this way the condition of morality; for freedom lies beyond the
phenomenon, and indeed beyond human arrangements. The state
is, as we have said, so little directed against egoism in general
and as such, that, on the contrary, it has sprung from egoism
and exists only in its service—an egoism that well understands
itself, proceeds methodically and forsakes the one-sided for the
universal point of view, and so by addition is the common
egoism of all. The state is thus instituted under the correct
presupposition that pure morality, i.e., right action from moral
grounds, is not to be expected; if this were not the case, it
would itself be superfluous. Thus the state, which aims at
well-being, is by no means directed against egoism, but only
against the disadvantageous consequences which arise from the
multiplicity of egoistic individuals, and reciprocally affect them
443
all and disturb their well-being. Therefore it was already said
by Aristotle (De. Rep. iii.): §μªø¬ ºμΩ ø≈Ω ¿øªμ…¬ ƒø μ≈ ∂∑Ω;
ƒø≈ƒø ¥μ μ√ƒπΩ ƒø ∂√Ω μ≈¥±πºøΩ…¬ ∫±π ∫±ª…¬ (Finis civitatis [446]
est bene vivere, hoc autem est beate et pulchre vivere). Hobbes
also has accurately and excellently expounded this origin and
end of the state; and that old first principle of all state policy,
salus publica prima lex esto, indicates the same thing. If the
state completely attains its end, it will produce the same outward
result as if perfect justice of disposition prevailed everywhere.
But the inner nature and origin of both phenomena will be the
converse. Thus in the second case it would be that no one
wished to do wrong, and in the first that no one wished to suffer
wrong, and the means appropriate to this end had been fully
employed. Thus the same line may be drawn from opposite
directions, and a beast of prey with a muzzle is as harmless as
a graminivorous animal. But beyond this point the state cannot
go. 

It cannot exhibit a phenomenon such as would spring from
universal mutual well-wishing and love. For just as we found
that from its nature it would not forbid the doing of a wrong
which involved no corresponding suffering of wrong on the
part of another, and prohibits all wrong-doing only because this
is impossible; so conversely, in accordance with its tendency
towards the well-being of all, it would very gladly take care
that every benevolent action and work of human love should
be experienced, if it were not that these also have an inevitable
correlative in the performance of acts of benevolence and works
of love, and every member of the state would wish to assume the
passive and none the active rôle, and there would be no reason
for exacting the latter from one member of the state rather than
from another. Accordingly only the negative, which is just the
right, not the positive, which has been comprehended under the
name of obligations of love, or, less completely, duties, can be
exacted by force.
Legislation, as we have said, borrows the pure philosophy
444 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
of right, or the doctrine of the nature and limits of right and
wrong, from ethics, in order to apply it from the reverse side[447]
to its own ends, which are different from those of ethics, and
to institute positive legislation and the means of supporting it,
i.e., the state, in accordance with it. Positive legislation is thus
the inverted application of the purely moral doctrine of right.
This application may be made with reference to the peculiar
relations and circumstances of a particular people. But only
if the positive legislation is, in essential matters, throughout
determined in accordance with the guidance of the pure theory of
right, and for each of its propositions a ground can be established
in the pure theory of right, is the legislation which has arisen
a positive right and the state a community based upon right, a
state in the proper meaning of the word, a morally permissible,
not immoral institution. Otherwise the positive legislation is, on
the contrary, the establishment of a positive wrong; it is itself
an openly avowed enforced wrong. Such is every despotism,
the constitution of most Mohammedan kingdoms; and indeed
various parts of many constitutions are also of this kind; for
example, serfdom, vassalage, and many such institutions. The
pure theory of right or natural right—better, moral right—though
always reversed, lies at the foundation of every just positive
legislation, as pure mathematics lies at the foundation of every
branch of applied mathematics. The most important points of
the doctrine of right, as philosophy has to supply it for that end
to legislation, are the following: 1. The explanation of the inner
and real significance both of the origin of the conceptions of
wrong and right, and of their application and position in ethics.
2. The deduction of the law of property. 3. The deduction of
the moral validity of contracts; for this is the moral basis of the
contract of the state. 4. The explanation of the origin and the
aim of the state, of the relation of this aim to ethics, and of
the intentional transference of the ethical doctrine of right, by
reversing it, to legislation, in consequence of this relation. 5. 

The deduction of the right of punishment. The remaining content of [448]
the doctrine of right is mere application of these principles, mere
accurate definition of the limits of right and wrong for all possible
relations of life, which are consequently united and distributed
under certain points of view and titles. In these special doctrines
the books which treat of pure law are fairly at one; it is only in the
principles that they differ much, for these are always connected
with some philosophical system. In connection with our system,
we have explained the first four of these principal points shortly
and generally, yet definitely and distinctly, and it remains for us
to speak in the same way of the right of punishment.

Kant makes the fundamentally false assertion that apart from
the state there would be no complete right of property. It follows
from our deduction, as given above, that even in a state of nature
there is property with complete natural, i.e., moral right, which
cannot be injured without wrong, but may without wrong be
defended to the uttermost. On the other hand, it is certain that
apart from the state there is no right of punishment. All right
to punish is based upon the positive law alone, which before
the offence has determined a punishment for it, the threat of
which, as a counter-motive, is intended to outweigh all possible
motives for the offence. This positive law is to be regarded
as sanctioned and recognised by all the members of the state.
It is thus based upon a common contract which the members
of the state are in duty bound to fulfil, and thus, on the one
hand, to inflict the punishment, and, on the other hand, to endure
it; thus the endurance of the punishment may with right be
enforced. Consequently the immediate end of punishment is,
in the particular case, the fulfilment of the law as a contract.
But the one end of the law is deterrence from the infringement
of the rights of others. For, in order that every one may be
protected from suffering wrong, men have combined to form [449]
a state, have renounced the doing of wrong, and assumed the
task of maintaining the state. Thus the law and the fulfilment of
446 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
it, the punishment, are essentially directed to the future, not to
the past. This distinguishes punishment from revenge; for the
motives which instigate the latter are solely concerned with what
has happened, and thus with the past as such. All requital of
wrong by the infliction of pain, without any aim for the future,
is revenge, and can have no other end than consolation for the
suffering one has borne by the sight of the suffering one has
inflicted upon another. This is wickedness and cruelty, and
cannot be morally justified. Wrong which some one has inflicted
upon me by no means entitles me to inflict wrong upon him.
The requital of evil with evil without further intention is neither
morally nor otherwise through any rational ground to be justified,
and the jus talionis set up as the absolute, final principle of the
right of punishment, is meaningless. Therefore Kant's theory of
punishment as mere requital for requital's sake is a completely
groundless and perverse view. Yet it is always appearing in
the writings of many jurists, under all kinds of lofty phrases,
which amount to nothing but empty words, as: Through the
punishment the crime is expiated or neutralised and abolished,
and many such. But no man has the right to set himself up
as a purely moral judge and requiter, and punish the misdeeds
of another with pains which he inflicts upon him, and so to
impose penance upon him for his sins. Nay, this would rather
be the most presumptuous arrogance; and therefore the Bible
says, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” But
man has the right to care for the safety of society; and this can
only be done by interdicting all actions which are denoted by the
word “criminal,” in order to prevent them by means of counter-
motives, which are the threatened punishments. And this threat
can only be made effective by carrying it out when a case occurs[450]
in spite of it. Accordingly that the end of punishment, or more
accurately of penal law, is the deterrence from crime, is a truth so
generally recognised and indeed self-evident, that in England it is
expressed in the very old form of indictment which is still served
447
by the counsel for the Crown in criminal actions, for it concludes
with the words, “If this be proved, you, the said N. N., ought
to be punished with pains of law, to deter others from the like
crimes in all time coming.” If a prince desires to extend mercy
to a criminal who has justly been condemned, his Ministers will
represent to him that, if he does, this crime will soon be repeated.
An end for the future distinguishes punishment from revenge,
and punishment only has this end when it is inflicted in fulfilment
of a law. It thus announces itself as inevitable in every future
case, and thus the law obtains the power to deter, in which its
end really consists. Now here a Kantian would inevitably reply
that certainly according to this view the punished criminal would
be used “merely as a means.” This proposition, so unweariedly
repeated by all the Kantians, “Man must always be treated as
an end, never as a means,” certainly sounds significant, and is
therefore a very suitable proposition for those who like to have
a formula which saves them all further thought; but looked at in
the light, it is an exceedingly vague, indefinite assertion, which
reaches its aim quite indirectly, requires to be explained, defined,
and modified in every case of its application, and, if taken
generally, is insufficient, meagre, and moreover problematical.
The murderer who has been condemned to the punishment of
death according to law must now, at any rate, and with complete
right, be used as a mere means. For public security, the chief end
of the state, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law
is not carried out. The murderer, his life, his person, must now be
the means of fulfilling the law, and thereby of re-establishing the
public security. And he is made such a means with perfect right,
in fulfilment of the contract of the state, which was entered into [451]
by him because he was a citizen, and in accordance with which,
in order to enjoy security for his life, freedom, and property, he
has pledged his life, his freedom, and his property for the security
of all, which pledge has now been forfeited.

This theory of punishment which we have established, the theory which is directly supported by sound reason, is certainly
in the main no new thought; but it is a thought which was
almost supplanted by new errors, and therefore it was necessary
to exhibit it as distinctly as possible. The same thing is in its
essence contained in what Puffendorf says on the subject, “De
Officio Hominis et Civis” (Bk. ii. chap. 12). 

Hobbes also agrees with it, “Leviathan” (chaps. 15-28). 

Feurbach maintained it. 

It occurs even in the
utterances of the ancient philosophers. Plato expresses it clearly
in the “Protagoras” (p. 114, edit. Bip.), also in the “Gorgias”
(p. 168), and lastly in the eleventh book of the “Laws” (p. 165).
Seneca expresses Plato's opinion and the theory of all punishment
in the short sentence, “Nemo prudens punit, quia peccatum est;
sed ne peccetur” (De Ira, i. 16).

Thus we have come to recognise in the state the means by
which egoism endowed with reason seeks to escape from its
own evil consequences which turn against itself, and now each
promotes the well-being of all because he sees that his own well-
being is involved in it. If the state attained its end completely,
then to a certain extent something approaching to an Utopia
might finally, by the removal of all kinds of evil, be brought
about. For by the human powers united in it, it is able to make the
rest of nature more and more serviceable. But as yet the state has
always remained very far from this goal. And even if it attained
to it, innumerable evils essential to all life would still keep it
in suffering; and finally, if they were all removed, ennui would
at once occupy every place they left. And besides, the strife of individuals is never completely abolished by the state, for it
vexes in trifles when it is prohibited in greater things. 

Finally,
Eris, happily expelled from within, turns to what is without; as
the conflict of individuals, she is banished by the institution of
the state; but she reappears from without as the war of nations,
and now demands in bulk and at once, as an accumulated debt,
the bloody sacrifice which by wise precautions has been denied her in the particular. And even supposing that all this were finally
overcome and removed, by wisdom founded on the experience
of thousands of years, at the end the result would be the actual
over-population of the whole planet, the terrible evil of which
only a bold imagination can now realise.76
