Temporal justice, which has its seat in the state, is requiting and punishing.

This only becomes justice through a reference to the future. 

Without this reference, all punishing and requiting would be an outrage without justification, and indeed merely the addition of another evil to that which has already occurred, without meaning or significance.

But it is quite otherwise with eternal justice, which was referred to before, and which rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure. 

The conception of requital implies that of time; therefore eternal justice cannot be requital. Thus it cannot, like temporal justice, admit of respite and delay, and require time in order to triumph, equalising the evil deed by the evil consequences only by means of time. 

The punishment must here be so bound up with the offence that both are one.

(“Volare pennis scelera ad ætherias domus
Putatis, illic in Jovis tabularia
Scripto referri; tum Jovem lectis super
Sententiam proferre?—sed mortalium
Facinora cœli, quantaquanta est, regia
Nequit tenere: nec legendis Juppiter
Et puniendis par est. Est tamen ultio,
Et, si intuemur, illa nos habitat prope.”)

Such an eternal justice really lies in the nature of
the world will soon become completely evident to whoever has
grasped the whole of the thought which we have hitherto been
developing.

The world, in all the multiplicity of its parts and forms, is the
manifestation, the objectivity, of the one will to live. Existence
itself, and the kind of existence, both as a collective whole and
in every part, proceeds from the will alone. The will is free,
the will is almighty. The will appears in everything, just as it
determines itself in itself and outside time. The world is only the
mirror of this willing; and all finitude, all suffering, all miseries,
which it contains, belong to the expression of that which the will
wills, are as they are because the will so wills. Accordingly with
perfect right every being supports existence in general, and also
the existence of its species and its peculiar individuality, entirely
as it is and in circumstances as they are, in a world such as it is,
swayed by chance and error, transient, ephemeral, and constantly
suffering; and in all that it experiences, or indeed can experience,
it always gets its due. For the will belongs to it; and as the will is,[454]
so is the world. Only this world itself can bear the responsibility
of its own existence and nature—no other; for by what means
could another have assumed it? Do we desire to know what men,
morally considered, are worth as a whole and in general, we have
only to consider their fate as a whole and in general. This is
want, wretchedness, affliction, misery, and death. Eternal justice
451
reigns; if they were not, as a whole, worthless, their fate, as a
whole, would not be so sad. In this sense we may say, the world
itself is the judgment of the world. If we could lay all the misery
of the world in one scale of the balance, and all the guilt of the
world in the other, the needle would certainly point to the centre.
Certainly, however, the world does not exhibit itself to the
knowledge of the individual as such, developed for the service of
the will, as it finally reveals itself to the inquirer as the objectivity
of the one and only will to live, which he himself is. But the sight
of the uncultured individual is clouded, as the Hindus say, by the
veil of Mâyâ. He sees not the thing-in-itself but the phenomenon
in time and space, the principium individuationis, and in the
other forms of the principle of sufficient reason. And in this
form of his limited knowledge he sees not the inner nature of
things, which is one, but its phenomena as separated, disunited,
innumerable, very different, and indeed opposed. For to him
pleasure appears as one thing and pain as quite another thing:
one man as a tormentor and a murderer, another as a martyr
and a victim; wickedness as one thing and evil as another. He
sees one man live in joy, abundance, and pleasure, and even
at his door another die miserably of want and cold. Then he
asks, Where is the retribution? And he himself, in the vehement,
pressure of will which is his origin and his nature, seizes upon
the pleasures and enjoyments of life, firmly embraces them, and [455]
knows not that by this very act of his will he seizes and hugs
all those pains and sorrows at the sight of which he shudders.
He sees the ills and he sees the wickedness in the world, but far
from knowing that both of these are but different sides of the
manifestation of the one will to live, he regards them as very
different, and indeed quite opposed, and often seeks to escape by
wickedness, i.e., by causing the suffering of another, from ills,
from the suffering of his own individuality, for he is involved in
the principium individuationis, deluded by the veil of Mâyâ. Just
as a sailor sits in a boat trusting to his frail barque in a stormy sea,
452 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
unbounded in every direction, rising and falling with the howling
mountainous waves; so in the midst of a world of sorrows the
individual man sits quietly, supported by and trusting to the
principium individuationis, or the way in which the individual
knows things as phenomena. The boundless world, everywhere
full of suffering in the infinite past, in the infinite future, is
strange to him, indeed is to him but a fable; his ephemeral
person, his extensionless present, his momentary satisfaction,
this alone has reality for him; and he does all to maintain this, so
long as his eyes are not opened by a better knowledge. Till then,
there lives only in the inmost depths of his consciousness a very
obscure presentiment that all that is after all not really so strange
to him, but has a connection with him, from which the principium
individuationis cannot protect him. From this presentiment arises
that ineradicable awe common to all men (and indeed perhaps
even to the most sensible of the brutes) which suddenly seizes
them if by any chance they become puzzled about the principium
individuationis, because the principle of sufficient reason in some
one of its forms seems to admit of an exception. For example,
if it seems as if some change took place without a cause, or
some one who is dead appears again, or if in any other way[456]
the past or the future becomes present or the distant becomes
near. The fearful terror at anything of the kind is founded on
the fact that they suddenly become puzzled about the forms
of knowledge of the phenomenon, which alone separate their
own individuality from the rest of the world. But even this
separation lies only in the phenomenon, and not in the thing-
in-itself; and on this rests eternal justice. In fact, all temporal
happiness stands, and all prudence proceeds, upon ground that
is undermined. They defend the person from accidents and
supply its pleasures; but the person is merely phenomenon, and
its difference from other individuals, and exemption from the
sufferings which they endure, rests merely in the form of the
phenomenon, the principium individuationis. According to the
453
true nature of things, every one has all the suffering of the world
as his own, and indeed has to regard all merely possible suffering
as for him actual, so long as he is the fixed will to live, i.e., asserts
life with all his power. For the knowledge that sees through the
principium individuationis, a happy life in time, the gift of chance
or won by prudence, amid the sorrows of innumerable others, is
only the dream of a beggar in which he is a king, but from which
he must awake and learn from experience that only a fleeting
illusion had separated him from the suffering of his life.
Eternal justice withdraws itself from the vision that is involved
in the knowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason
in the principium individuationis; such vision misses it altogether
unless it vindicates it in some way by fictions. It sees the bad,
after misdeeds and cruelties of every kind, live in happiness and
leave the world unpunished. It sees the oppressed drag out a
life full of suffering to the end without an avenger, a requiter
appearing. But that man only will grasp and comprehend eternal
justice who raises himself above the knowledge that proceeds
under the guidance of the principle of sufficient reason, bound [457]
to the particular thing, and recognises the Ideas, sees through
the principium individuationis, and becomes conscious that the
forms of the phenomenon do not apply to the thing-in-itself.
Moreover, he alone, by virtue of the same knowledge, can
understand the true nature of virtue, as it will soon disclose itself
to us in connection with the present inquiry, although for the
practice of virtue this knowledge in the abstract is by no means
demanded. Thus it becomes clear to whoever has attained to the
knowledge referred to, that because the will is the in-itself of all
phenomena, the misery which is awarded to others and that which
he experiences himself, the bad and the evil, always concerns
only that one inner being which is everywhere the same, although
the phenomena in which the one and the other exhibits itself exist
as quite different individuals, and are widely separated by time
and space. He sees that the difference between him who inflicts
454 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the suffering and him who must bear it is only the phenomenon,
and does not concern the thing-in-itself, for this is the will living
in both, which here, deceived by the knowledge which is bound
to its service, does not recognise itself, and seeking an increased
happiness in one of its phenomena, produces great suffering in
another, and thus, in the pressure of excitement, buries its teeth
in its own flesh, not knowing that it always injures only itself,
revealing in this form, through the medium of individuality, the
conflict with itself which it bears in its inner nature. The inflicter
of suffering and the sufferer are one. The former errs in that he
believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the latter, in that he
believes he is not a partaker in the guilt. If the eyes of both were
opened, the inflicter of suffering would see that he lives in all
that suffers pain in the wide world, and which, if endowed with
reason, in vain asks why it was called into existence for such great
suffering, its desert of which it does not understand. And the
sufferer would see that all the wickedness which is or ever was[458]
committed in the world proceeds from that will which constitutes
his own nature also, appears also in him, and that through this
phenomenon and its assertion he has taken upon himself all the
sufferings which proceed from such a will and bears them as his
due, so long as he is this will. From this knowledge speaks the
profound poet Calderon in “Life a Dream”—
“Pues el delito mayor
Del hombre es haber nacido.”
(“For the greatest crime of man
Is that he ever was born.”)
455
Why should it not be a crime, since, according to an eternal
law, death follows upon it? Calderon has merely expressed in
these lines the Christian dogma of original sin.
The living knowledge of eternal justice, of the balance that
inseparably binds together the malum culpæ with the malum
pœnæ, demands the complete transcending of individuality and
the principle of its possibility. Therefore it will always remain
unattainable to the majority of men, as will also be the case with
the pure and distinct knowledge of the nature of all virtue, which
is akin to it, and which we are about to explain. Accordingly the
wise ancestors of the Hindu people have directly expressed it in
the Vedas, which are only allowed to the three regenerate castes,
or in their esoteric teaching, so far at any rate as conception
and language comprehend it, and their method of exposition,
which always remains pictorial and even rhapsodical, admits;
but in the religion of the people, or exoteric teaching, they only
communicate it by means of myths. The direct exposition we
find in the Vedas, the fruit of the highest human knowledge
and wisdom, the kernel of which has at last reached us in the
Upanishads as the greatest gift of this century. It is expressed
in various ways, but especially by making all the beings in the [459]
world, living and lifeless, pass successively before the view of
the student, and pronouncing over every one of them that word
which has become a formula, and as such has been called the
Mahavakya: Tatoumes,—more correctly, Tat twam asi,—which
means, “This thou art.”77 But for the people, that great truth, so
far as in their limited condition they could comprehend it, was
translated into the form of knowledge which follows the principle
of sufficient reason. This form of knowledge is indeed, from its
nature, quite incapable of apprehending that truth pure and in
itself, and even stands in contradiction to it, yet in the form of a
myth it received a substitute for it which was sufficient as a guide
77 Oupnek'hat, vol. i. p. 60 et seq.
456 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
for conduct. For the myth enables the method of knowledge, in
accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, to comprehend
by figurative representation the ethical significance of conduct,
which itself is ever foreign to it. This is the aim of all systems
of religion, for as a whole they are the mythical clothing of the
truth which is unattainable to the uncultured human intellect.
In this sense this myth might, in Kant's language, be called a
postulate of the practical reason; but regarded as such, it has
the great advantage that it contains absolutely no elements but
such as lie before our eyes in the course of actual experience,
and can therefore support all its conceptions with perceptions.
What is here referred to is the myth of the transmigration of
souls. It teaches that all sufferings which in life one inflicts upon
other beings must be expiated in a subsequent life in this world,
through precisely the same sufferings; and this extends so far,
that he who only kills a brute must, some time in endless time,
be born as the same kind of brute and suffer the same death. It
teaches that wicked conduct involves a future life in this world
in suffering and despised creatures, and, accordingly, that one
will then be born again in lower castes, or as a woman, or as a[460]
brute, as Pariah or Tschandala, as a leper, or as a crocodile, and
so forth. All the pains which the myth threatens it supports with
perceptions from actual life, through suffering creatures which
do not know how they have merited their misery, and it does not
require to call in the assistance of any other hell. As a reward,
on the other hand, it promises re-birth in better, nobler forms,
as Brahmans, wise men, or saints. The highest reward, which
awaits the noblest deeds and the completest resignation, which
is also given to the woman who in seven successive lives has
voluntarily died on the funeral pile of her husband, and not less
to the man whose pure mouth has never uttered a single lie,—this
reward the myth can only express negatively in the language
of this world by the promise, which is so often repeated, that
they shall never be born again, Non adsumes iterum existentiam apparentem; or, as the Buddhists, who recognise neither Vedas
nor castes, express it, “Thou shalt attain to Nirvâna,” i.e., to a
state in which four things no longer exist—birth, age, sickness,
and death.

Never has a myth entered, and never will one enter, more
closely into the philosophical truth which is attainable to so
few than this primitive doctrine of the noblest and most ancient
nation. Broken up as this nation now is into many parts, this
myth yet reigns as the universal belief of the people, and has the
most decided influence upon life to-day, as four thousand years
ago. Therefore Pythagoras and Plato have seized with admiration
on that ne plus ultra of mythical representation, received it from
India or Egypt, honoured it, made use of it, and, we know not
how far, even believed it. We, on the contrary, now send the
Brahmans English clergymen and evangelical linen-weavers to
set them right out of sympathy, and to show them that they are
created out of nothing, and ought thankfully to rejoice in the fact.
But it is just the same as if we fired a bullet against a cliff. In India
our religions will never take root. The ancient wisdom of the [461]
human race will not be displaced by what happened in Galilee.
On the contrary, Indian philosophy streams back to Europe,
and will produce a fundamental change in our knowledge and
thought.
