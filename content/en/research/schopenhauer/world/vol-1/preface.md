Translators' Preface.
The style of “Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung” is sometimes
loose and involved, as is so often the case in German
philosophical treatises. The translation of the book has
consequently been a matter of no little difficulty. It was found
that extensive alteration of the long and occasionally involved
sentences, however likely to prove conducive to a satisfactory
English style, tended not only to obliterate the form of the
original but even to imperil the meaning. Where a choice has had
to be made, the alternative of a somewhat slavish adherence to
Schopenhauer's ipsissima verba has accordingly been preferred
to that of inaccuracy. The result is a piece of work which leaves
much to be desired, but which has yet consistently sought to
reproduce faithfully the spirit as well as the letter of the original.
As regards the rendering of the technical terms about which
there has been so much controversy, the equivalents used have
only been adopted after careful consideration of their meaning in
the theory of knowledge. For example, “Vorstellung” has been
rendered by “idea,” in preference to “representation,” which is
neither accurate, intelligible, nor elegant. “Idee,” is translated
by the same word, but spelled with a capital,—“Idea.” Again,[vi]
“Anschauung” has been rendered according to the context, either
by “perception” simply, or by “intuition or perception.”
Notwithstanding statements to the contrary in the text, the
book is probably quite intelligible in itself, apart from the treatise
“On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.” It
has, however, been considered desirable to add an abstract of the
latter work in an appendix to the third volume of this translation.

Preface To The First Edition.

I propose to point out here how this book must be read in order
to be thoroughly understood. By means of it I only intend to
impart a single thought. Yet, notwithstanding all my endeavours,
I could find no shorter way of imparting it than this whole book.
I hold this thought to be that which has very long been sought
for under the name of philosophy, and the discovery of which
is therefore regarded by those who are familiar with history as
quite as impossible as the discovery of the philosopher's stone,
although it was already said by Pliny: Quam multa fieri non
posse, priusquam sint facta, judicantur? (Hist. nat. 7, 1.)
According as we consider the different aspects of this one
thought which I am about to impart, it exhibits itself as that
which we call metaphysics, that which we call ethics, and that
which we call æsthetics; and certainly it must be all this if it is
what I have already acknowledged I take it to be.
A system of thought must always have an architectonic
connection or coherence, that is, a connection in which one
part always supports the other, though the latter does not support
the former, in which ultimately the foundation supports all the
rest without being supported by it, and the apex is supported
without supporting. On the other hand, a single thought, however
comprehensive it may be, must preserve the most perfect[viii]
unity. If it admits of being broken up into parts to facilitate
its communication, the connection of these parts must yet be
organic, i.e., it must be a connection in which every part supports
the whole just as much as it is supported by it, a connection in
which there is no first and no last, in which the whole thought
gains distinctness through every part, and even the smallest part
cannot be completely understood unless the whole has already
Preface To The First Edition. 5
been grasped. A book, however, must always have a first and a
last line, and in this respect will always remain very unlike an
organism, however like one its content may be: thus form and
matter are here in contradiction.
It is self-evident that under these circumstances no other advice
can be given as to how one may enter into the thought explained
in this work than to read the book twice, and the first time with
great patience, a patience which is only to be derived from the
belief, voluntarily accorded, that the beginning presupposes the
end almost as much as the end presupposes the beginning, and
that all the earlier parts presuppose the later almost as much
as the later presuppose the earlier. I say “almost;” for this
is by no means absolutely the case, and I have honestly and
conscientiously done all that was possible to give priority to that
which stands least in need of explanation from what follows, as
indeed generally to everything that can help to make the thought
as easy to comprehend and as distinct as possible. This might
indeed to a certain extent be achieved if it were not that the
reader, as is very natural, thinks, as he reads, not merely of what
is actually said, but also of its possible consequences, and thus
besides the many contradictions actually given of the opinions [ix]
of the time, and presumably of the reader, there may be added
as many more which are anticipated and imaginary. That, then,
which is really only misunderstanding, must take the form of
active disapproval, and it is all the more difficult to recognise that
it is misunderstanding, because although the laboriously-attained
clearness of the explanation and distinctness of the expression
never leaves the immediate sense of what is said doubtful, it
cannot at the same time express its relations to all that remains
to be said. Therefore, as we have said, the first perusal demands
patience, founded on confidence that on a second perusal much,
or all, will appear in an entirely different light. Further, the
earnest endeavour to be more completely and even more easily
comprehended in the case of a very difficult subject, must justify occasional repetition. Indeed the structure of the whole, which
is organic, not a mere chain, makes it necessary sometimes to
touch on the same point twice. Moreover this construction, and
the very close connection of all the parts, has not left open to
me the division into chapters and paragraphs which I should
otherwise have regarded as very important, but has obliged me to
rest satisfied with four principal divisions, as it were four aspects
of one thought. In each of these four books it is especially
important to guard against losing sight, in the details which must
necessarily be discussed, of the principal thought to which they
belong, and the progress of the whole exposition. I have thus
expressed the first, and like those which follow, unavoidable
demand upon the reader, who holds the philosopher in small
favour just because he himself is a philosopher.

The second demand is this, that the introduction be read[x]
before the book itself, although it is not contained in the
book, but appeared five years earlier under the title, “Ueber
die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde:
eine philosophische Abhandlung” (On the fourfold root of the
principle of sufficient reason: a philosophical essay). Without
an acquaintance with this introduction and propadeutic it is
absolutely impossible to understand the present work properly,
and the content of that essay will always be presupposed in this
work just as if it were given with it. Besides, even if it had not
preceded this book by several years, it would not properly have
been placed before it as an introduction, but would have been
incorporated in the first book. As it is, the first book does not
contain what was said in the earlier essay, and it therefore exhibits
a certain incompleteness on account of these deficiencies, which
must always be supplied by reference to it. However, my
disinclination was so great either to quote myself or laboriously
to state again in other words what I had already said once in an
adequate manner, that I preferred this course, notwithstanding
the fact that I might now be able to give the content of that
Preface To The First Edition. 7
essay a somewhat better expression, chiefly by freeing it from
several conceptions which resulted from the excessive influence
which the Kantian philosophy had over me at the time, such
as—categories, outer and inner sense, and the like. But even
there these conceptions only occur because as yet I had never
really entered deeply into them, therefore only by the way and
quite out of connection with the principal matter. The correction
of such passages in that essay will consequently take place of its
own accord in the mind of the reader through his acquaintance
with the present work. But only if we have fully recognised [xi]
by means of that essay what the principle of sufficient reason is
and signifies, what its validity extends to, and what it does not
extend to, and that that principle is not before all things, and the
whole world merely in consequence of it, and in conformity to
it, a corollary, as it were, of it; but rather that it is merely the
form in which the object, of whatever kind it may be, which is
always conditioned by the subject, is invariably known so far as
the subject is a knowing individual: only then will it be possible
to enter into the method of philosophy which is here attempted
for the first time, and which is completely different from all
previous methods.
But the same disinclination to repeat myself word for word,
or to say the same thing a second time in other and worse
words, after I have deprived myself of the better, has occasioned
another defect in the first book of this work. For I have omitted
all that is said in the first chapter of my essay “On Sight and
Colour,” which would otherwise have found its place here, word
for word. Therefore the knowledge of this short, earlier work is
also presupposed.

Finally, the third demand I have to make on the reader might
indeed be tacitly assumed, for it is nothing but an acquaintance
with the most important phenomenon that has appeared in
philosophy for two thousand years, and that lies so near us:
I mean the principal writings of Kant. It seems to me, in fact,
8 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
as indeed has already been said by others, that the effect these
writings produce in the mind to which they truly speak is very
like that of the operation for cataract on a blind man: and if we
wish to pursue the simile further, the aim of my own work may
be described by saying that I have sought to put into the hands of
those upon whom that operation has been successfully performed[xii]
a pair of spectacles suitable to eyes that have recovered their
sight—spectacles of whose use that operation is the absolutely
necessary condition. Starting then, as I do to a large extent, from
what has been accomplished by the great Kant, I have yet been
enabled, just on account of my earnest study of his writings, to
discover important errors in them. These I have been obliged
to separate from the rest and prove to be false, in order that I
might be able to presuppose and apply what is true and excellent
in his doctrine, pure and freed from error. But not to interrupt
and complicate my own exposition by a constant polemic against
Kant, I have relegated this to a special appendix. It follows then,
from what has been said, that my work presupposes a knowledge
of this appendix just as much as it presupposes a knowledge of
the philosophy of Kant; and in this respect it would therefore be
advisable to read the appendix first, all the more as its content
is specially related to the first book of the present work. On the
other hand, it could not be avoided, from the nature of the case,
that here and there the appendix also should refer to the text of
the work; and the only result of this is, that the appendix, as well
as the principal part of the work, must be read twice.
The philosophy of Kant, then, is the only philosophy with
which a thorough acquaintance is directly presupposed in what
we have to say here. But if, besides this, the reader has lingered
in the school of the divine Plato, he will be so much the better
prepared to hear me, and susceptible to what I say. And if,
indeed, in addition to this he is a partaker of the benefit conferred
by the Vedas, the access to which, opened to us through the
Upanishads, is in my eyes the greatest advantage which this[xiii]
Preface To The First Edition. 9
still young century enjoys over previous ones, because I believe
that the influence of the Sanscrit literature will penetrate not less
deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the fifteenth
century: if, I say, the reader has also already received and
assimilated the sacred, primitive Indian wisdom, then is he best
of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him. My work
will not speak to him, as to many others, in a strange and even
hostile tongue; for, if it does not sound too vain, I might express
the opinion that each one of the individual and disconnected
aphorisms which make up the Upanishads may be deduced as a
consequence from the thought I am going to impart, though the
converse, that my thought is to be found in the Upanishads, is by
no means the case.

But most readers have already grown angry with impatience,
and burst into reproaches with difficulty kept back so long. How
can I venture to present a book to the public under conditions and
demands the first two of which are presumptuous and altogether
immodest, and this at a time when there is such a general
wealth of special ideas, that in Germany alone they are made
common property through the press, in three thousand valuable,
original, and absolutely indispensable works every year, besides
innumerable periodicals, and even daily papers; at a time when
especially there is not the least deficiency of entirely original and
profound philosophers, but in Germany alone there are more of
them alive at the same time, than several centuries could formerly
boast of in succession to each other? How is one ever to come to
the end, asks the indignant reader, if one must set to work upon
a book in such a fashion? [xiv]
As I have absolutely nothing to advance against these
reproaches, I only hope for some small thanks from such readers
for having warned them in time, so that they may not lose an
hour over a book which it would be useless to read without
complying with the demands that have been made, and which
should therefore be left alone, particularly as apart from this we
10 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
might wager a great deal that it can say nothing to them, but
rather that it will always be only pancorum hominum, and must
therefore quietly and modestly wait for the few whose unusual
mode of thought may find it enjoyable. For apart from the
difficulties and the effort which it requires from the reader, what
cultured man of this age, whose knowledge has almost reached
the august point at which the paradoxical and the false are all
one to it, could bear to meet thoughts almost on every page
that directly contradict that which he has yet himself established
once for all as true and undeniable? And then, how disagreeably
disappointed will many a one be if he finds no mention here of
what he believes it is precisely here he ought to look for, because
his method of speculation agrees with that of a great living
philosopher,1 who has certainly written pathetic books, and who
only has the trifling weakness that he takes all he learned and
approved before his fifteenth year for inborn ideas of the human
mind. Who could stand all this? Therefore my advice is simply
to lay down the book.
But I fear I shall not escape even thus. The reader who has got
as far as the preface and been stopped by it, has bought the book
for cash, and asks how he is to be indemnified. My last refuge
is now to remind him that he knows how to make use of a book
in several ways, without exactly reading it. It may fill a gap in[xv]
his library as well as many another, where, neatly bound, it will
certainly look well. Or he can lay it on the toilet-table or the
tea-table of some learned lady friend. Or, finally, what certainly
is best of all, and I specially advise it, he can review it.
And now that I have allowed myself the jest to which in this
two-sided life hardly any page can be too serious to grant a
place, I part with the book with deep seriousness, in the sure
hope that sooner or later it will reach those to whom alone it can be addressed; and for the rest, patiently resigned that the
same fate should, in full measure, befall it, that in all ages
has, to some extent, befallen all knowledge, and especially the
weightiest knowledge of the truth, to which only a brief triumph
is allotted between the two long periods in which it is condemned
as paradoxical or disparaged as trivial. The former fate is also
wont to befall its author. But life is short, and truth works far and
lives long: let us speak the truth.

Preface To The Second Edition.
Not to my contemporaries, not to my compatriots—to mankind
I commit my now completed work in the confidence that it
will not be without value for them, even if this should be late
recognised, as is commonly the lot of what is good. For it
cannot have been for the passing generation, engrossed with the
delusion of the moment, that my mind, almost against my will,
has uninterruptedly stuck to its work through the course of a long
life. And while the lapse of time has not been able to make me
doubt the worth of my work, neither has the lack of sympathy;
for I constantly saw the false and the bad, and finally the absurd
and senseless,2 stand in universal admiration and honour, and
I bethought myself that if it were not the case those who are
capable of recognising the genuine and right are so rare that we
may look for them in vain for some twenty years, then those who
are capable of producing it could not be so few that their works
afterwards form an exception to the perishableness of earthly
things; and thus would be lost the reviving prospect of posterity
which every one who sets before himself a high aim requires to
strengthen him.
Whoever seriously takes up and pursues an object that does
not lead to material advantages, must not count on the sympathy[xviii]
of his contemporaries. For the most part he will see, however,
that in the meantime the superficial aspect of that object becomes
current in the world, and enjoys its day; and this is as it
should be. The object itself must be pursued for its own sake,
otherwise it cannot be attained; for any design or intention
is always dangerous to insight. Accordingly, as the whole

2 The Hegelian Philosophy.

Preface To The Second Edition. 13

history of literature proves, everything of real value required a
long time to gain acceptance, especially if it belonged to the
class of instructive, not entertaining, works; and meanwhile the
false flourished. For to combine the object with its superficial
appearance is difficult, when it is not impossible. Indeed that is
just the curse of this world of want and need, that everything must
serve and slave for these; and therefore it is not so constituted
that any noble and sublime effort, like the endeavour after light
and truth, can prosper unhindered and exist for its own sake.
But even if such an endeavour has once succeeded in asserting
itself, and the conception of it has thus been introduced, material
interests and personal aims will immediately take possession of
it, in order to make it their tool or their mask. Accordingly,
when Kant brought philosophy again into repute, it had soon to
become the tool of political aims from above, and personal aims
from below; although, strictly speaking, not philosophy itself,
but its ghost, that passes for it. This should not really astonish
us; for the incredibly large majority of men are by nature quite
incapable of any but material aims, indeed they can conceive
no others. Thus the pursuit of truth alone is far too lofty and
eccentric an endeavour for us to expect all or many, or indeed
even a few, faithfully to take part in. If yet we see, as for
example at present in Germany, a remarkable activity, a general [xix]
moving, writing, and talking with reference to philosophical
subjects, we may confidently assume that, in spite of solemn
looks and assurances, only real, not ideal aims, are the actual
primum mobile, the concealed motive of such a movement; that
it is personal, official, ecclesiastical, political, in short, material
ends that are really kept in view, and consequently that mere
party ends set the pens of so many pretended philosophers in
such rapid motion. Thus some design or intention, not the desire
of insight, is the guiding star of these disturbers of the peace, and
truth is certainly the last thing that is thought of in the matter. It
finds no partisans; rather, it may pursue its way as silently and
14 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
unheeded through such a philosophical riot as through the winter
night of the darkest century bound in the rigid faith of the church,
when it was communicated only to a few alchemists as esoteric
learning, or entrusted it may be only to the parchment. Indeed I
might say that no time can be more unfavourable to philosophy
than that in which it is shamefully misused, on the one hand to
further political objects, on the other as a means of livelihood. Or
is it believed that somehow, with such effort and such a turmoil,
the truth, at which it by no means aims, will also be brought
to light? Truth is no prostitute, that throws herself away upon
those who do not desire her; she is rather so coy a beauty that he
who sacrifices everything to her cannot even then be sure of her
favour.

If Governments make philosophy a means of furthering
political ends, learned men see in philosophical professorships a
trade that nourishes the outer man just like any other; therefore
they crowd after them in the assurance of their good intentions,
that is, the purpose of subserving these ends. And they keep[xx]
their word: not truth, not clearness, not Plato, not Aristotle,
but the ends they were appointed to serve are their guiding
star, and become at once the criterion of what is true, valuable,
and to be respected, and of the opposites of these. Whatever,
therefore, does not answer these ends, even if it were the most
important and extraordinary things in their department, is either
condemned, or, when this seems hazardous, suppressed by being
unanimously ignored. Look only at their zeal against pantheism;
will any simpleton believe that it proceeds from conviction? And,
in general, how is it possible that philosophy, degraded to the
position of a means of making one's bread, can fail to degenerate
into sophistry? Just because this is infallibly the case, and the
rule, “I sing the song of him whose bread I eat,” has always
held good, the making of money by philosophy was regarded
by the ancients as the characteristic of the sophists. But we
have still to add this, that since throughout this world nothing is
Preface To The Second Edition. 15
to be expected, can be demanded, or is to be had for gold but
mediocrity, we must be contented with it here also. Consequently
we see in all the German universities the cherished mediocrity
striving to produce the philosophy which as yet is not there to
produce, at its own expense and indeed in accordance with a
predetermined standard and aim, a spectacle at which it would
be almost cruel to mock.
While thus philosophy has long been obliged to serve entirely
as a means to public ends on the one side and private ends on
the other, I have pursued the course of my thought, undisturbed
by them, for more than thirty years, and simply because I was
obliged to do so and could not help myself, from an instinctive
impulse, which was, however, supported by the confidence that [xxi]
anything true one may have thought, and anything obscure one
may have thrown light upon, will appeal to any thinking mind,
no matter when it comprehends it, and will rejoice and comfort it.
To such an one we speak as those who are like us have spoken to
us, and have so become our comfort in the wilderness of this life.
Meanwhile the object is pursued on its own account and for its
own sake. Now it happens curiously enough with philosophical
meditations, that precisely that which one has thought out and
investigated for oneself, is afterwards of benefit to others; not
that, however, which was originally intended for others. The
former is confessedly nearest in character to perfect honesty;
for a man does not seek to deceive himself, nor does he offer
himself empty husks; so that all sophistication and all mere talk
is omitted, and consequently every sentence that is written at
once repays the trouble of reading it. Thus my writings bear
the stamp of honesty and openness so distinctly on the face
of them, that by this alone they are a glaring contrast to those
of three celebrated sophists of the post-Kantian period. I am
always to be found at the standpoint of reflection, i.e., rational
deliberation and honest statement, never at that of inspiration,
called intellectual intuition, or absolute thought; though, if it received its proper name, it would be called empty bombast and
charlatanism. Working then in this spirit, and always seeing
the false and bad in universal acceptance, yea, bombast3 and
charlatanism4 in the highest honour, I have long renounced the
approbation of my contemporaries. It is impossible that an age
which for twenty years has applauded a Hegel, that intellectual
Caliban, as the greatest of the philosophers, so loudly that it[xxii]
echoes through the whole of Europe, could make him who has
looked on at that desirous of its approbation. It has no more
crowns of honour to bestow; its applause is prostituted, and its
censure has no significance. That I mean what I say is attested
by the fact that if I had in any way sought the approbation of
my contemporaries, I would have had to strike out a score of
passages which entirely contradict all their opinions, and indeed
must in part be offensive to them. But I would count it a crime
to sacrifice a single syllable to that approbation. My guiding
star has, in all seriousness, been truth. Following it, I could
first aspire only to my own approbation, entirely averted from
an age deeply degraded as regards all higher intellectual efforts,
and a national literature demoralised even to the exceptions, a
literature in which the art of combining lofty words with paltry
significance has reached its height. I can certainly never escape
from the errors and weaknesses which, in my case as in every
one else's, necessarily belong to my nature; but I will not increase
them by unworthy accommodations.
As regards this second edition, first of all I am glad to say
that after five and twenty years I find nothing to retract; so that
my fundamental convictions have only been confirmed, as far
as concerns myself at least. The alterations in the first volume
therefore, which contains the whole text of the first edition,
nowhere touch what is essential. Sometimes they concern things
of merely secondary importance, and more often consist of
3 Fichte and Schelling.
4 Hegel.
Preface To The Second Edition. 17
very short explanatory additions inserted here and there. Only
the criticism of the Kantian philosophy has received important
corrections and large additions, for these could not be put into
a supplementary book, such as those which are given in the [xxiii]
second volume, and which correspond to each of the four books
that contain the exposition of my own doctrine. In the case of
the latter, I have chosen this form of enlarging and improving
them, because the five and twenty years that have passed since
they were composed have produced so marked a change in my
method of exposition and in my style, that it would not have done
to combine the content of the second volume with that of the first,
as both must have suffered by the fusion. I therefore give both
works separately, and in the earlier exposition, even in many
places where I would now express myself quite differently, I have
changed nothing, because I desired to guard against spoiling the
work of my earlier years through the carping criticism of age.
What in this regard might need correction will correct itself in
the mind of the reader with the help of the second volume. Both
volumes have, in the full sense of the word, a supplementary
relation to each other, so far as this rests on the fact that one
age of human life is, intellectually, the supplement of another. It
will therefore be found, not only that each volume contains what
the other lacks, but that the merits of the one consist peculiarly
in that which is wanting in the other. Thus, if the first half of
my work surpasses the second in what can only be supplied by
the fire of youth and the energy of first conceptions, the second
will surpass the first by the ripeness and complete elaboration of
the thought which can only belong to the fruit of the labour of
a long life. For when I had the strength originally to grasp the
fundamental thought of my system, to follow it at once into its
four branches, to return from them to the unity of their origin,
and then to explain the whole distinctly, I could not yet be in
a position to work out all the branches of the system with the [xxiv]
fulness, thoroughness, and elaborateness which is only reached
18 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
by the meditation of many years—meditation which is required
to test and illustrate the system by innumerable facts, to support
it by the most different kinds of proof, to throw light on it from
all sides, and then to place the different points of view boldly in
contrast, to separate thoroughly the multifarious materials, and
present them in a well-arranged whole. Therefore, although it
would, no doubt, have been more agreeable to the reader to have
my whole work in one piece, instead of consisting, as it now does,
of two halves, which must be combined in using them, he must
reflect that this would have demanded that I should accomplish
at one period of life what it is only possible to accomplish in two,
for I would have had to possess the qualities at one period of life
that nature has divided between two quite different ones. Hence
the necessity of presenting my work in two halves supplementary
to each other may be compared to the necessity in consequence
of which a chromatic object-glass, which cannot be made out
of one piece, is produced by joining together a convex lens of
flint glass and a concave lens of crown glass, the combined
effect of which is what was sought. Yet, on the other hand,
the reader will find some compensation for the inconvenience of
using two volumes at once, in the variety and the relief which
is afforded by the handling of the same subject, by the same
mind, in the same spirit, but in very different years. However,
it is very advisable that those who are not yet acquainted with
my philosophy should first of all read the first volume without
using the supplementary books, and should make use of these
only on a second perusal; otherwise it would be too difficult for
them to grasp the system in its connection. For it is only thus[xxv]
explained in the first volume, while the second is devoted to a
more detailed investigation and a complete development of the
individual doctrines. Even those who should not make up their
minds to a second reading of the first volume had better not read
the second volume till after the first, and then for itself, in the
ordinary sequence of its chapters, which, at any rate, stand in
Preface To The Second Edition. 19
some kind of connection, though a somewhat looser one, the gaps
of which they will fully supply by the recollection of the first
volume, if they have thoroughly comprehended it. Besides, they
will find everywhere the reference to the corresponding passages
of the first volume, the paragraphs of which I have numbered
in the second edition for this purpose, though in the first edition
they were only divided by lines.
I have already explained in the preface to the first edition,
that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore
presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here.
For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of every one who has
comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it
may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able
really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the
original character of the intellect, which neither Berkeley nor
Malebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much in
the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed
in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him,
and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate
effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes
a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in
another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible
to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the [xxvi]
other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy,
whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state
of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that
natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which
fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of
philosophy. Such a man then stands to the man who knows
the Kantian philosophy as a minor to a man of full age. That
this truth should nowadays sound paradoxical, which would not
have been the case in the first thirty years after the appearance
of the Critique of Reason, is due to the fact that a generation
has grown up that does not know Kant properly, because it has
20 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
never heard more of him than a hasty, impatient lecture, or an
account at second-hand; and this again is due to the fact that
in consequence of bad guidance, this generation has wasted its
time with the philosophemes of vulgar, uncalled men, or even
of bombastic sophists, which are unwarrantably commended
to it. Hence the confusion of fundamental conceptions, and in
general the unspeakable crudeness and awkwardness that appears
from under the covering of affectation and pretentiousness in
the philosophical attempts of the generation thus brought up.
But whoever thinks he can learn Kant's philosophy from the
exposition of others makes a terrible mistake. Nay, rather I
must earnestly warn against such accounts, especially the more
recent ones; and indeed in the years just past I have met with
expositions of the Kantian philosophy in the writings of the
Hegelians which actually reach the incredible. How should the
minds that in the freshness of youth have been strained and ruined
by the nonsense of Hegelism, be still capable of following Kant's
profound investigations? They are early accustomed to take the[xxvii]
hollowest jingle of words for philosophical thoughts, the most
miserable sophisms for acuteness, and silly conceits for dialectic,
and their minds are disorganised through the admission of mad
combinations of words to which the mind torments and exhausts
itself in vain to attach some thought. No Critique of Reason can
avail them, no philosophy, they need a medicina mentis, first
as a sort of purgative, un petit cours de senscommunologie, and
then one must further see whether, in their case, there can even
be any talk of philosophy. The Kantian doctrine then will be
sought for in vain anywhere else but in Kant's own works; but
these are throughout instructive, even where he errs, even where
he fails. In consequence of his originality, it holds good of him
in the highest degree, as indeed of all true philosophers, that one
can only come to know them from their own works, not from the
accounts of others. For the thoughts of any extraordinary intellect
cannot stand being filtered through the vulgar mind. Born behind

the broad, high, finely-arched brow, from under which shine
beaming eyes, they lose all power and life, and appear no longer
like themselves, when removed to the narrow lodging and low
roofing of the confined, contracted, thick-walled skull from
which dull glances steal directed to personal ends. Indeed we
may say that minds of this kind act like an uneven glass, in
which everything is twisted and distorted, loses the regularity of
its beauty, and becomes a caricature. Only from their authors
themselves can we receive philosophical thoughts; therefore
whoever feels himself drawn to philosophy must himself seek
out its immortal teachers in the still sanctuary of their works.
The principal chapters of any one of these true philosophers will
afford a thousand times more insight into their doctrines than [xxviii]
the heavy and distorted accounts of them that everyday men
produce, who are still for the most part deeply entangled in the
fashionable philosophy of the time, or in the sentiments of their
own minds. But it is astonishing how decidedly the public seizes
by preference on these expositions at second-hand. It seems
really as if elective affinities were at work here, by virtue of
which the common nature is drawn to its like, and therefore
will rather hear what a great man has said from one of its own
kind. Perhaps this rests on the same principle as that of mutual
instruction, according to which children learn best from children.
One word more for the professors of philosophy. I have
always been compelled to admire not merely the sagacity, the
true and fine tact with which, immediately on its appearance,
they recognised my philosophy as something altogether different
from and indeed dangerous to their own attempts, or, in popular
language, something that would not suit their turn; but also
the sure and astute policy by virtue of which they at once
discovered the proper procedure with regard to it, the complete
harmony with which they applied it, and the persistency with
which they have remained faithful to it. This procedure, which
22 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
further commended itself by the great ease of carrying it out,
consists, as is well known, in altogether ignoring and thus in
secreting—according to Goethe's malicious phrase, which just
means the appropriating of what is of weight and significance.
The efficiency of this quiet means is increased by the Corybantic
shouts with which those who are at one reciprocally greet the
birth of their own spiritual children—shouts which compel the[xxix]
public to look and note the air of importance with which they
congratulate themselves on the event. Who can mistake the
object of such proceedings? Is there then nothing to oppose
to the maxim, primum vivere, deinde philosophari? These
gentlemen desire to live, and indeed to live by philosophy. To
philosophy they are assigned with their wives and children, and
in spite of Petrarch's povera e nuda vai filosofia, they have
staked everything upon it. Now my philosophy is by no means
so constituted that any one can live by it. It lacks the first
indispensable requisite of a well-paid professional philosophy, a
speculative theology, which—in spite of the troublesome Kant
with his Critique of Reason—should and must, it is supposed,
be the chief theme of all philosophy, even if it thus takes on
itself the task of talking straight on of that of which it can know
absolutely nothing. Indeed my philosophy does not permit to the
professors the fiction they have so cunningly devised, and which
has become so indispensable to them, of a reason that knows,
perceives, or apprehends immediately and absolutely. This is a
doctrine which it is only necessary to impose upon the reader at
starting, in order to pass in the most comfortable manner in the
world, as it were in a chariot and four, into that region beyond the
possibility of all experience, which Kant has wholly and for ever
shut out from our knowledge, and in which are found immediately
revealed and most beautifully arranged the fundamental dogmas
of modern, Judaising, optimistic Christianity. Now what in
the world has my subtle philosophy, deficient as it is in these
essential requisites, with no intentional aim, and unable to afford
Preface To The Second Edition. 23
a means of subsistence, whose pole star is truth alone the [xxx]
naked, unrewarded, unbefriended, often persecuted truth, and
which steers straight for it without looking to the right hand or
the left,—what, I say, has this to do with that alma mater, the
good, well-to-do university philosophy which, burdened with
a hundred aims and a thousand motives, comes on its course
cautiously tacking, while it keeps before its eyes at all times
the fear of the Lord, the will of the ministry, the laws of the
established church, the wishes of the publisher, the attendance
of the students, the goodwill of colleagues, the course of current
politics, the momentary tendency of the public, and Heaven
knows what besides? Or what has my quiet, earnest search for
truth in common with the noisy scholastic disputations of the
chair and the benches, the inmost motives of which are always
personal aims. The two kinds of philosophy are, indeed, radically
different. Thus it is that with me there is no compromise and
no fellowship, that no one reaps any benefit from my works
but the man who seeks the truth alone, and therefore none of
the philosophical parties of the day; for they all follow their
own aims, while I have only insight into truth to offer, which
suits none of these aims, because it is not modelled after any of
them. If my philosophy is to become susceptible of professorial
exposition, the times must entirely change. What a pretty thing
it would be if a philosophy by which nobody could live were to
gain for itself light and air, not to speak of the general ear! This
must be guarded against, and all must oppose it as one man. But
it is not just such an easy game to controvert and refute; and,
moreover, these are mistaken means to employ, because they just
direct the attention of the public to the matter, and its taste for the
lucubrations of the professors of philosophy might be destroyed [xxxi]
by the perusal of my writings. For whoever has tasted of earnest
will not relish jest, especially when it is tiresome. Therefore the
silent system, so unanimously adopted, is the only right one, and
I can only advise them to stick to it and go on with it as long as it
24 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
will answer, that is, until to ignore is taken to imply ignorance;
then there will just be time to turn back. Meanwhile it remains
open to every one to pluck out a small feather here and there for
his own use, for the superfluity of thoughts at home should not be
very oppressive. Thus the ignoring and silent system may hold
out a good while, at least the span of time I may have yet to live,
whereby much is already won. And if, in the meantime, here and
there an indiscreet voice has let itself be heard, it is soon drowned
by the loud talking of the professors, who, with important airs,
know how to entertain the public with very different things.
I advise, however, that the unanimity of procedure should be
somewhat more strictly observed, and especially that the young
men should be looked after, for they are sometimes so fearfully
indiscreet. For even so I cannot guarantee that the commended
procedure will last for ever, and cannot answer for the final issue.
It is a nice question as to the steering of the public, which, on
the whole, is good and tractable. Although we nearly at all times
see the Gorgiases and the Hippiases uppermost, although the
absurd, as a rule, predominates, and it seems impossible that the
voice of the individual can ever penetrate through the chorus of
the befooling and the befooled, there yet remains to the genuine
works of every age a quite peculiar, silent, slow, and powerful
influence; and, as if by a miracle, we see them rise at last[xxxii]
out of the turmoil like a balloon that floats up out of the thick
atmosphere of this globe into purer regions, where, having once
arrived, it remains at rest, and no one can draw it down again.
