The senses are merely the channels through which the brain receives from without (in the form of sensations) the materials which it works up into ideas of perception. 

Those sensations which principally serve for the objective comprehension of the external world must in themselves be neither agreeable nor disagreeable. This really means that they must leave the will entirely unaffected. Otherwise the sensation itself would attract our attention, and we would remain at the effect instead of passing to the cause, which is what is aimed at here. 

For it would bring with it that marked superiority, as regards our consideration, which the will always has over the mere idea, to which we only turn when the will is silent. Therefore colours and sounds are
in themselves, and so long as their impression does not pass the
normal degree, neither painful nor pleasurable sensations, but
appear with the indifference that fits them to be the material of
pure objective perception. This is as far the case as was possible in
a body which is in itself through and through will; and just in this
respect it is worthy of admiration. Physiologically it rests upon
the fact that in the organs of the nobler senses, thus in sight and
hearing, the nerves which have to receive the specific outward
impression are quite insusceptible to any sensation of pain, and
know no other sensation than that which is specifically peculiar
to them, and which serves the purpose of mere apprehension.

Thus the retina, as also the optic nerve, is insensible to every
injury; and this is also the case with the nerve of hearing. In
both organs pain is only felt in their other parts, the surroundings
of the nerve of sense which is peculiar to them, never in this
nerve itself. In the case of the eye such pain is felt principally in
the conjunctiva; in the case of the ear, in the meatus auditorius.

Even with the brain this is the case, for if it is cut into directly,
thus from above, it has no feeling. Thus only on account of this
indifference with regard to the will which is peculiar to them are
the sensations of the eye capable of supplying the understanding
with such multifarious and finely distinguished data, out of which
it constructs in our head the marvellous objective world, by the
application of the law of causality upon the foundation of the
pure perceptions of space and time. Just that freedom from
affecting the will which is characteristic of sensations of colour
enables them, when their energy is heightened by transparency,
as in the glow of an evening sky, in painted glass, and the like,
to raise us very easily into the state of pure objective will-less
perception, which, as I have shown in my third book, is one of
the chief constituent elements of the æsthetic impression. Just
this indifference with regard to the will fits sounds to supply the
material for denoting the infinite multiplicity of the conceptions
of the reason.
Outer sense, that is, receptivity for external impressions as
pure data for the understanding, is divided into five senses, and
these accommodate themselves to the four elements, i.e., the
four states of aggregation, together with that of imponderability.
Thus the sense for what is firm (earth) is touch; for what is fluid
(water), taste; for what is in the form of vapour, i.e., volatile
(vapour, exhalation), smell; for what is permanently elastic (air),
hearing; for what is imponderable (fire, light), sight. The second
imponderable, heat, is not properly an object of the senses, but
of general feeling, and therefore always affects the will directly,
as agreeable or disagreeable. From this classification there also
follows the relative dignity of the senses. Sight has the highest
rank, because its sphere is the widest and its susceptibility
the finest. This rests upon the fact that what affects it is an
imponderable, that is, something which is scarcely corporeal, but
is quasi spiritual. Hearing has the second place, corresponding
to air. However, touch is a more thorough and well-informed
[195]186

sense. For while each of the other senses gives us only an entirely
one-sided relation to the object, as its sound, or its relation to
light, touch, which is closely bound up with general feeling and
muscular power, supplies the understanding with the data at once
for the form, magnitude, hardness, softness, texture, firmness,
temperature, and weight of bodies, and all this with the least
possibility of illusion and deception, to which all the other senses
are far more subject. The two lowest senses, smell and taste, are
no longer free from a direct affection of the will, that is, they
are always agreeably or disagreeably affected, and are therefore
more subjective than objective.
Sensations of hearing are exclusively in time, and therefore
the whole nature of music consists in degrees of time, upon
which depends both the quality or pitch of tones, by means of
vibrations, and also their quantity or duration, by means of time.
The sensations of sight, on the other hand, are primarily and
principally in space; but secondarily, by reason of their duration,
they are also in time.
Sight is the sense of the understanding which perceives;
hearing is the sense of the reason which thinks and apprehends.
Words are only imperfectly represented by visible signs; and
therefore I doubt whether a deaf and dumb man, who can read,
but has no idea of the sound of the words, works as quickly in
thinking with the mere visible signs of conceptions as we do with
the real, i.e., the audible words. If he cannot read, it is well
known that he is almost like an irrational animal, while the man
born blind is from the first a thoroughly rational being.
Sight is an active, hearing a passive sense. Therefore sounds
affect our mind in a disturbing and hostile manner, and indeed
they do so the more in proportion as the mind is active and
developed; they distract all thoughts and instantly destroy the
power of thinking. On the other hand, there is no analogous
disturbance through the eye, no direct effect of what is seen,
as such, upon the activity of thought (for naturally we are notChapter III. On The Senses.

speaking here of the influence which the objects looked at have
upon the will); but the most varied multitude of things before our
eyes admits of entirely unhindered and quiet thought. Therefore
the thinking mind lives at peace with the eye, but is always at war
with the ear. This opposition of the two senses is also confirmed
by the fact that if deaf and dumb persons are cured by galvanism
they become deadly pale with terror at the first sounds they hear
(Gilbert's “Annalen der Physik,” vol. x. p. 382), while blind
persons, on the contrary, who have been operated upon, behold
with ecstasy the first light, and unwillingly allow the bandages to
be put over their eyes again. All that has been said, however, can
be explained from the fact that hearing takes place by means of
a mechanical vibration of the nerve of hearing which is at once
transmitted to the brain, while seeing, on the other hand, is a real
action of the retina which is merely stimulated and called forth
by light and its modifications; as I have shown at length in my
physiological theory of colours. But this whole opposition stands
in direct conflict with that coloured-ether, drum-beating theory
which is now everywhere unblushingly served up, and which
seeks to degrade the eye's sensation of light to a mechanical
vibration, such as primarily that of hearing actually is, while
nothing can be more different than the still, gentle effect of light
and the alarm-drum of hearing. If we add to this the remarkable
circumstance that although we hear with two ears, the sensibility
of which is often very different, yet we never hear a sound
double, as we often see things double with our two eyes, we
are led to the conjecture that the sensation of hearing does not
arise in the labyrinth or in the cochlea, but deep in the brain
where the two nerves of hearing meet, and thus the impression
becomes simple. But this is where the pons Varolii encloses
the medulla oblongata, thus at the absolutely lethal spot, by the
injury of which every animal is instantly killed, and from which
the nerve of hearing has only a short course to the labyrinth,
the seat of acoustic vibration. 

Now it is just because its source  is here, in this dangerous place, in which also all movement of
the limbs originates, that we start at a sudden noise; which does
not occur in the least degree when we suddenly see a light; for
example, a flash of lightning. The optic nerve, on the contrary,
proceeds from its thalami much further forward (though perhaps
its source lies behind them), and throughout its course is covered
by the anterior lobes of the brain, although always separated
from them till, having extended quite out of the brain, it is
spread out in the retina, upon which, on stimulation by light,
the sensation first arises, and where it is really localised. This
is shown in my essay upon sight and colour. This origin of
the auditory nerve explains, then, the great disturbance which
the power of thinking suffers from sound, on account of which
thinking men, and in general all people of much intellect, are
without exception absolutely incapable of enduring any noise.
For it disturbs the constant stream of their thoughts, interrupts
and paralyses their thinking, just because the vibration of the
auditory nerve extends so deep into the brain, the whole mass
of which feels the oscillations set up through this nerve, and
vibrates along with them, and because the brains of such persons
are more easily moved than those of ordinary men. On the same
readiness to be set in motion, and capacity for transmission,
which characterises their brains depends the fact that in the case
of persons like these every thought calls forth so readily all those
analogous or related to it whereby the similarities, analogies, and
relations of things in general come so quickly and easily into
their minds; that the same occasion which millions of ordinary
minds have experienced before brings them to the thought, to the
discovery, that other people are subsequently surprised they did
not reach themselves, for they certainly can think afterwards, but
they cannot think before. Thus the sun shone on all statues, but
only the statue of Memnon gave forth a sound. For this reason
Kant, Gœthe, and Jean Paul were highly sensitive to every noise, as their biographers bear witness.13 Gœthe in his last years
bought a house which had fallen into disrepair close to his own,
simply in order that he might not have to endure the noise that
would be made in repairing it. Thus it was in vain that in his
youth he followed the drum in order to harden himself against
noise. It is not a matter of custom. On the other hand, the truly
stoical indifference to noise of ordinary minds is astonishing. No
noise disturbs them in their thinking, reading, writing, or other
occupations, while the finer mind is rendered quite incapable by
it. But just that which makes them so insensible to noise of every
kind makes them also insensible to the beautiful in plastic art,
and to deep thought or fine expression in literary art; in short,
to all that does not touch their personal interests. The following
remark of Lichtenberg's applies to the paralysing effect which
noise has upon highly intellectual persons: “It is always a good
sign when an artist can be hindered by trifles from exercising his
art. F—— used to stick his fingers into sulphur if he wished to
play the piano.... Such things do not interfere with the average
mind;... it acts like a coarse sieve” (Vermischte Schriften, vol.
i. p. 398). 

I have long really held the opinion that the amount
of noise which any one can bear undisturbed stands in inverse
proportion to his mental capacity, and therefore may be regarded
as a pretty fair measure of it. Therefore, if I hear the dogs barking
for hours together in the court of a house without being stopped, I
know what to think of the intellectual capacity of the inhabitants.
The man who habitually slams the door of a room, instead of
shutting it with his hand, or allows this to go on in his house,
is not only ill-bred, but is also a coarse and dull-minded fellow.
That in English “sensible” also means gifted with understanding
is based upon accurate and fine observation. We shall only

Lichtenberg says in his “Nachrichten und Bemerkungen von und über sich
selbst” (Vermischte Schriften, Göttingen, 1800, vol. i. p. 43): “I am extremely
sensitive to all noise, but it entirely loses its disagreeable character as soon as
it is associated with a rational purpose.” -->

become quite civilised when the ears are no longer unprotected,
and when it shall no longer be the right of everybody to sever
the consciousness of each thinking being, in its course of a
thousand steps, with whistling, howling, bellowing, hammering,
whip-cracking, barking, &c. &c. The Sybarites banished all
noisy trades without the town; the honourable sect of the Shakers
in North America permit no unnecessary noise in their villages,
and the Moravians have a similar rule. Something more is said
upon this subject in the thirtieth chapter of the second volume of
the “Parerga.”

The effect of music upon the mind, so penetrating, so direct, so unfailing, may be explained from the passive nature of hearing which has been discussed; also the after effect which sometimes follows it, and which consists in a specially elevated frame of mind. The vibrations of the tones following in rationally combined numerical relations set the fibre of the brain itself in similar vibration. On the other hand, the active nature of sight, opposed as it is to the passive nature of hearing, makes it intelligible why there can be nothing analogous to music for the eye, and the piano of colours was an absurd mistake. Further, it is just on account of the active nature of the sense of sight that it is remarkably acute in the case of beasts that hunt, i.e., beasts of prey, while conversely the passive sense of hearing is specially acute in those beasts that are hunted, that flee, and are timid, so that it may give them timely warning of the pursuer that is rushing or creeping upon them.

Just as we have recognised in sight the sense of the
understanding, and in hearing the sense of the reason, so we
might call smell the sense of the memory, because it recalls to us
more directly than any other the specific impression of an event
or a scene even from the most distant past.
