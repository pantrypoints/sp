This chapter, along with the one which follows it, is connected with § 8 and 9 of the first book.


It must be possible to arrive at a complete knowledge of the consciousness of the brutes, for we can construct it by abstracting certain properties of our own consciousness. 

On the other hand,  there enters into the consciousness of the brute instinct, which is
much more developed in all of them than in man, and in some of
them extends to what we call mechanical instinct.

The brutes have:
- understanding without having reason, and
- knowledge of perception but no abstract knowledge

They apprehend correctly and grasp the immediate causal connection but they do not think. 

This is because they lack conceptions as abstract ideas.

The first consequence of this is the lack of a proper memory.

This is the principal difference between their consciousness and that of men. 

Perfect intelligence depends on the distinct consciousness of the past and of the eventual future, as such, and in connection with the present.

The special memory which this demands is therefore an orderly, connected, and thinking retrospective recollection. 

This, however, is only possible by means of general conceptions, the assistance of which is required by what is entirely individual, in order that it may be recalled in its order and connection. 

For the boundless multitude of things and events of the same and similar kinds, in the course of our life, does not admit directly of a perceptible and individual recollection of each particular, for which neither the powers of the most  comprehensive memory nor our time would be sufficient.

Therefore all this can only be preserved by subsuming it under general conceptions, and the consequent reference to relatively few principles, by means of which we then have always at command an orderly and adequate survey of our past. 

We can only present to ourselves in perception particular scenes of the past, but the time that has passed since then and its content we are conscious of only in the abstract by means of conceptions of things and numbers which now represent days and years, together with their content. 

The memory of the brutes, on the contrary, like their whole intellect, is confined to what they perceive, and primarily consists merely in the fact that a recurring impression presents itself as having already been experienced, for the present perception revivifies the traces of an earlier one.

Their memory is therefore always dependent upon what is now actually present. Just on this account, however,
this excites anew the sensation and the mood which the earlier
phenomenon produced. Thus the dog recognises acquaintances,
distinguishes friends from enemies, easily finds again the path
it has once travelled, the houses it has once visited, and at the
sight of a plate or a stick is at once put into the mood associated
with them. All kinds of training depend upon the use of this
perceptive memory and on the force of habit, which in the case
of animals is specially strong. It is therefore just as different
from human education as perception is from thinking. We
ourselves are in certain cases, in which memory proper refuses
us its service, confined to that merely perceptive recollection,
and thus we can measure the difference between the two from
our own experience. For example, at the sight of a person
whom it appears to us we know, although we are not able to
remember when or where we saw him; or again, when we visit
a place where we once were in early childhood, that is, while our reason was yet undeveloped, and which we have therefore
entirely forgotten, and yet feel that the present impression is one
which we have already experienced. 

This is the nature of all the recollections of the brutes. We have only to add that in the case of the most sagacious this merely perceptive memory rises to a certain degree of phantasy, which again assists it, and by virtue of which, for example, the image of its absent master floats before the mind of the dog and excites a longing after him, so that when
he remains away long it seeks for him everywhere. 

Its dreams also depend upon this phantasy. The consciousness of the brutes is accordingly a mere succession of presents, none of which, however, exist as future before they appear, nor as past after they have vanished; which is the specific difference of human
consciousness. Hence the brutes have infinitely less to suffer
than we have, because they know no other pains but those which
the present directly brings. But the present is without extension,
while the future and the past, which contain most of the causes
of our suffering, are widely extended, and to their actual content
there is added that which is merely possible, which opens up
an unlimited field for desire and aversion. The brutes, on the
contrary, undisturbed by these, enjoy quietly and peacefully each
present moment, even if it is only bearable. Human beings of
very limited capacity perhaps approach them in this. Further,
the sufferings which belong purely to the present can only be
physical. Indeed the brutes do not properly speaking feel death:
they can only know it when it appears, and then they are already
no more. Thus then the life of the brute is a continuous present.
It lives on without reflection, and exists wholly in the present;
even the great majority of men live with very little reflection.
Another consequence of the special nature of the intellect of the
brutes, which we have explained is the perfect accordance of their
consciousness with their environment. Between the brute and the
external world there is nothing, but between us and the external
world there is always our thought about it, which makes us often
[231]228
[232]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
inapproachable to it, and it to us. Only in the case of children
and very primitive men is this wall of partition so thin that in
order to see what goes on in them we only need to see what goes
on round about them. Therefore the brutes are incapable alike of
purpose and dissimulation; they reserve nothing. In this respect
the dog stands to the man in the same relation as a glass goblet
to a metal one, and this helps greatly to endear the dog so much
to us, for it affords us great pleasure to see all those inclinations
and emotions which we so often conceal displayed simply and
openly in him. In general, the brutes always play, as it were, with
their hand exposed; and therefore we contemplate with so much
pleasure their behaviour towards each other, both when they
belong to the same and to different species. It is characterised by
a certain stamp of innocence, in contrast to the conduct of men,
which is withdrawn from the innocence of nature by the entrance
of reason, and with it of prudence or deliberation. Hence human
conduct has throughout the stamp of intention or deliberate
purpose, the absence of which, and the consequent determination
by the impulse of the moment, is the fundamental characteristic
of all the action of the brutes. No brute is capable of a purpose
properly so-called. To conceive and follow out a purpose is
the prerogative of man, and it is a prerogative which is rich in
consequences. Certainly an instinct like that of the bird of passage
or the bee, still more a permanent, persistent desire, a longing like
that of the dog for its absent master, may present the appearance
of a purpose, with which, however, it must not be confounded.
Now all this has its ultimate ground in the relation between the
human and the brute intellect, which may also be thus expressed:
The brutes have only direct knowledge, while we, in addition
to this, have indirect knowledge; and the advantage which in
many things—for example, in trigonometry and analysis, in
machine work instead of hand work, &c.—indirect has over
direct knowledge appears here also. Thus again we may say:
The brutes have only a single intellect, we a double intellect,Chapter V. On The Irrational Intellect.
229
both perceptive and thinking, and the operation of the two often
go on independently of each other. We perceive one thing, and
we think another. Often, again, they act upon each other. This
way of putting the matter enables us specially to understand that
natural openness and naivete of the brutes, referred to above, as
contrasted with the concealment of man.
However, the law natura non facit saltus is not entirely
suspended even with regard to the intellect of the brutes, though
certainly the step from the brute to the human intelligence is
the greatest which nature has made in the production of her
creatures. In the most favoured individuals of the highest
species of the brutes there certainly sometimes appears, always
to our astonishment, a faint trace of reflection, reason, the
comprehension of words, of thought, purpose, and deliberation.
The most striking indications of this kind are afforded by the
elephant, whose highly developed intelligence is heightened
and supported by an experience of a lifetime which sometimes
extends to two hundred years. He has often given unmistakable
signs, recorded in well-known anecdotes, of premeditation,
which, in the case of brutes, always astonishes us more than
anything else. Such, for instance, is the story of the tailor on
whom an elephant revenged himself for pricking him with a
needle. I wish, however, to rescue from oblivion a parallel case
to this, because it has the advantage of being authenticated by
judicial investigation. On the 27th of August 1830 there was held
at Morpeth, in England, a coroner's inquest on the keeper, Baptist
Bernhard, who was killed by his elephant. It appeared from the
evidence that two years before he had offended the elephant
grossly, and now, without any occasion, but on a favourable
opportunity, the elephant had seized him and crushed him. (See
the Spectator and other English papers of that day.) For special
information on the intelligence of brutes I recommend Leroy's
excellent book, “Sur l'Intelligence des Animaux,” nouv. éd. 1802.
