3. If we run through the series of grades of animals downwards,
we see the intellect always becoming weaker and less perfect, but
we by no means observe a corresponding degradation of the will.
Rather it retains everywhere its identical nature and shows itself
in the form of great attachment to life, care for the individual and
the species, egoism and regardlessness of all others, together with
the emotions that spring from these. Even in the smallest insect
the will is present, complete and entire; it wills what it wills as
decidedly and completely as the man. The difference lies merely in what it wills, i.e., in the motives, which, however, are the affair of the intellect. 

It indeed, as the secondary part of consciousness,
and bound to the bodily organism, has innumerable degrees of
completeness, and is in general essentially limited and imperfect.
The will, on the contrary, as original and the thing in itself, can
never be imperfect, but every act of will is all that it can be. On
account of the simplicity which belongs to the will as the thing in
itself, the metaphysical in the phenomenon, its nature admits of
no degrees, but is always completely itself. Only its excitement
has degrees, from the weakest inclination to the passion, and
also its susceptibility to excitement, thus its vehemence from the
phlegmatic to the choleric temperament. 

The intellect, on the
other hand, has not merely degrees of excitement, from sleepiness
to being in the vein, and inspiration, but also degrees of its nature,
of the completeness of this, which accordingly rises gradually
from the lowest animals, which can only obscurely apprehend,
up to man, and here again from the fool to the genius. The will
alone is everywhere completely itself. For its function is of the
utmost simplicity; it consists in willing and not willing, which
goes on with the greatest ease, without effort, and requires no
practice. Knowing, on the contrary, has multifarious functions,
and never takes place entirely without effort, which is required
to fix the attention and to make clear the object, and at a higher
stage is certainly needed for thinking and deliberation; therefore
it is also capable of great improvement through exercise and
education. 

If the intellect presents a simple, perceptible object to
the will, the latter expresses at once its approval or disapproval
of it, and this even if the intellect has laboriously inquired and
pondered, in order from numerous data, by means of difficult
combinations, ultimately to arrive at the conclusion as to which
of the two seems to be most in conformity with the interests of the
will. The latter has meanwhile been idly resting, and when the
conclusion is arrived at it enters, as the Sultan enters the Divan,
merely to express again its monotonous approval or disapproval,407
which certainly may vary in degree, but in its nature remains
always the same.

This fundamentally different nature of the will and the intellect,
the essential simplicity and originality of the former, in contrast
to the complicated and secondary character of the latter, becomes
still more clear to us if we observe their remarkable interaction
within us, and now consider in the particular case, how the images
and thoughts which arise in the intellect move the will, and how
entirely separated and different are the parts which the two play.
We can indeed perceive this even in actual events which excite
the will in a lively manner, while primarily and in themselves
they are merely objects of the intellect. But, on the one hand, it is
here not so evident that this reality primarily existed only in the
intellect; and, on the other hand, the change does not generally
take place so rapidly as is necessary if the thing is to be easily
surveyed, and thereby become thoroughly comprehensible. Both
of these conditions, however, are fulfilled if it is merely thoughts
and phantasies which we allow to act on the will. If, for example,
alone with ourselves, we think over our personal circumstances,
and now perhaps vividly present to ourselves the menace of
an actually present danger and the possibility of an unfortunate
issue, anxiety at once compresses the heart, and the blood ceases
to circulate in the veins. But if then the intellect passes to the
possibility of an opposite issue, and lets the imagination picture
the long hoped for happiness thereby attained, all the pulses
quicken at once with joy and the heart feels light as a feather,
till the intellect awakes from its dream. Thereupon, suppose
that an occasion should lead the memory to an insult or injury
once suffered long ago, at once anger and bitterness pour into
the breast that was but now at peace. But then arises, called up
by accident, the image of a long-lost love, with which the whole
romance and its magic scenes is connected; then that anger will
at once give place to profound longing and sadness. 

Finally, if
there occurs to us some former humiliating incident, we shrink together, would like to sink out of sight, blush with shame, and
often try forcibly to distract and divert our thoughts by some loud
exclamation, as if to scare some evil spirit. One sees, the intellect
plays, and the will must dance to it. Indeed the intellect makes
the will play the part of a child which is alternately thrown at
pleasure into joyful or sad moods by the chatter and tales of its
nurse. This depends upon the fact that the will is itself without
knowledge, and the understanding which is given to it is without
will. Therefore the former is like a body which is moved, the
latter like the causes which set it in motion, for it is the medium
of motives. Yet in all this the primacy of the will becomes clear
again, if this will, which, as we have shown, becomes the sport
of the intellect as soon as it allows the latter to control it, once
makes its supremacy in the last instance felt by prohibiting the
intellect from entertaining certain ideas, absolutely preventing
certain trains of thought from arising, because it knows, i.e.,
learns from that very intellect, that they would awaken in it some
one of the emotions set forth above. It now bridles the intellect,
and compels it to turn to other things. Hard as this often may
be, it must yet be accomplished as soon as the will is in earnest
about it, for the resistance in this case does not proceed from
the intellect, which always remains indifferent, but from the will
itself, which in one respect has an inclination towards an idea
that in another respect it abhors. It is in itself interesting to the
will simply because it excites it, but at the same time abstract
knowledge tells it that this idea will aimlessly cause it a shock
of painful or unworthy emotion: it now decides in conformity
with this abstract knowledge, and compels the obedience of the
intellect. 

This is called “being master of oneself.” Clearly the
master here is the will, the servant the intellect, for in the last
instance the will always keeps the upper hand, and therefore
constitutes the true core, the inner being of man. In this respect
the title —3μ1⁄4¿1⁄21o¿1⁄2 would belong to the will; yet it seems, on
the other hand, to apply to the intellect, because it is the leader409
and guide, like the valet de place who conducts a stranger. In
truth, however, the happiest figure of the relation of the two is
the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man
who can see.

The relation of the will to the intellect here explained may also
be further recognised in the fact that the intellect is originally
entirely a stranger to the purposes of the will. It supplies the
motives to the will, but it only learns afterwards, completely
a posteriori, how they have affected it, as one who makes a
chemical experiment applies the reagents and awaits the result.
Indeed the intellect remains so completely excluded from the
real decisions and secret purposes of its own will that sometimes
it can only learn them like those of a stranger, by spying upon
them and surprising them, and must catch the will in the act
of expressing itself in order to get at its real intentions. For
example, I have conceived a plan, about which, however, I have
still some scruple, but the feasibleness of which, as regards its
possibility, is completely uncertain, for it depends upon external
and still undecided circumstances. It would therefore certainly
be unnecessary to come to a decision about it at present, and
so for the time I leave the matter as it is. Now in such a case
I often do not know how firmly I am already attached to that
plan in secret, and how much, in spite of the scruple, I wish
to carry it out: that is, my intellect does not know. But now
only let me receive news that it is practicable, at once there rises
within me a jubilant, irresistible gladness, that passes through
my whole being and takes permanent possession of it, to my own
astonishment. For now my intellect learns for the first time how
firmly my will had laid hold of that plan, and how thoroughly
the plan suited it, while the intellect had regarded it as entirely
problematical, and had with difficulty been able to overcome that
scruple. Or in another case, I have entered eagerly into a contract
which I believed to be very much in accordance with my wishes.

But as the matter progresses the disadvantages and burdens of it are felt, and I begin to suspect that I even repent of what I so eagerly pursued; yet I rid myself of this feeling by assuring
myself that even if I were not bound I would follow the same
course. Now, however, the contract is unexpectedly broken by
the other side, and I perceive with astonishment that this happens
to my great satisfaction and relief. Often we don't know what we
wish or what we fear. We may entertain a wish for years without
even confessing it to ourselves, or even allowing it to come to
clear consciousness; for the intellect must know nothing about
it, because the good opinion which we have of ourselves might
thereby suffer. But if it is fulfilled we learn from our joy, not
without shame, that we have wished this. For example, the death
of a near relation whose heir we are. And sometimes we do not
know what we really fear, because we lack the courage to bring
it to distinct consciousness. Indeed we are often in error as to
the real motive from which we have done something or left it
undone, till at last perhaps an accident discovers to us the secret,
and we know that what we have held to be the motive was not
the true one, but another which we had not wished to confess
to ourselves, because it by no means accorded with the good
opinion we entertained of ourselves. For example, we refrain
from doing something on purely moral grounds, as we believe,
but afterwards we discover that we were only restrained by fear,
for as soon as all danger is removed we do it. In particular
cases this may go so far that a man does not even guess the true
motive of his action, nay, does not believe himself capable of
being influenced by such a motive; and yet it is the true motive
of his action. We may remark in passing that in all this we have
a confirmation and explanation of the rule of Larochefoucauld:
“L'amour-propre est plus habile que le plus habile homme du
monde;” nay, even a commentary on the Delphic 31⁄2É ̧1 Ã±ÅÄ¿1⁄2
and its difficulty. If now, on the contrary, as all philosophers
imagine, the intellect constituted our true nature and the purposes
of the will were a mere result of knowledge, then only the motive411
from which we imagined that we acted would be decisive of our
moral worth; in analogy with the fact that the intention, not the
result, is in this respect decisive. But really then the distinction
between imagined and true motive would be impossible. Thus all
cases here set forth, to which every one who pays attention may
observe analogous cases in himself, show us how the intellect
is so strange to the will that it is sometimes even mystified by
it: for it indeed supplies it with motives, but does not penetrate
into the secret workshop of its purposes. It is indeed a confidant
of the will, but a confidant that is not told everything. This is
also further confirmed by the fact, which almost every one will
some time have the opportunity of observing in himself, that
sometimes the intellect does not thoroughly trust the will. If
we have formed some great and bold purpose, which as such is
yet really only a promise made by the will to the intellect, there
often remains within us a slight unconfessed doubt whether we
are quite in earnest about it, whether in carrying it out we will
not waver or draw back, but will have sufficient firmness and
persistency to fulfil it. It therefore requires the deed to convince
us ourselves of the sincerity of the purpose.
All these facts prove the absolute difference of the will and the
intellect, the primacy of the former and the subordinate position
of the latter.
