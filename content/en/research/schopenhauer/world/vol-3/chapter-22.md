<!-- 1 This chapter is connected with the last half of § 27 of the first volume. -->


There are 2 different ways of regarding the intellect:

1. Subjective

This starts from within and taking the consciousness as the given. This shows us how:
- the world exhibits itself in it
- the intellect constructs itself in the world out of the materials provided by the senses and the understanding 

Locke is the originator of this method.

Kant brought it to a higher perfection.

 <!-- and our first book also, together with its supplements, are devoted to it. -->

2. Objective

This starts from the outside. It takes as its object the beings given in outward experience, not our own consciousness.

Those beings are conscious of themselves and of the world.

The intellect investigates:
- the relation of their intellect to their other qualities
- how it has become possible
- how it has become necessary
- what it accomplishes for them

The takes the empirical standpoint. It takes the world and the animal existences present in it as absolutely given, in that it starts from them.

It is accordingly primarily zoological, anatomical, physiological, and only becomes philosophical by connection with that first method of consideration, and from the higher point of view thereby attained.

The only foundations of this which as yet have been given we owe to zootomists and physiologists, for the
most part French. Here Cabanis is specially to be named, whose excellent work, “Des rapports du physique au moral,” is initiatory of this method of consideration on the path of physiology.

The famous Bichat was his contemporary, but his theme was a much more comprehensive one. Even Gall may be named here,
although his chief aim was missed. Ignorance and prejudice have
raised against this method of consideration the accusation of
materialism, because, adhering simply to experience, it does not
know the immaterial substance, soul. The most recent advances
in the physiology of the nervous system, through Sir Charles
Bell, Magendie, Marshall Hall, and others, have also enriched
and corrected the material of this method of consideration. A
philosophy which, like the Kantian, entirely ignores this point
of view for the intellect is one-sided, and consequently inade-
quate. It leaves an impassable gulf between our philosophical
and our physiological knowledge, with which we can never find
satisfaction.

<!-- Although what I have said in the two preceding chapters
concerning the life and the activity of the brain belongs to this
method of consideration, and in the same way all the discussions
to be found under the heading, “Pflanzenphysiologie,” in the
essay, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” and also a portion of
those under the heading “Vergleichende Anatomie,” are devoted
to it, the following exposition of its results in general will be by
no means superfluous. -->

We become most vividly conscious of the glaring contrast between the 2 methods of considering the intellect opposed to each other above if we carry the matter to the extreme and realise that what the one, as reflective thought and vivid perception,
directly assumes and makes its material is for the other nothing more than the physiological function of an internal organ, [007]
the brain; nay, that we are justified in asserting that the whole
objective world, so boundless in space, so infinite in time, so
unsearchable in its perfection, is really only a certain movement
or affection of the pulpy matter in the skull. We then ask in
astonishment: what is this brain whose function produces such
a phenomenon of all phenomena? What is the matter which can
be refined and potentiated to such a pulp that the stimulation of a few of its particles becomes the conditional supporter of the existence of an objective world? 

The fear of such questions led to the hypothesis of the simple substance of an immaterial soul, which merely dwelt in the brain. We say boldly: this pulp also, like every vegetable or animal part, is an organic structure, like
all its poorer relations in the inferior accommodation of the heads
of our irrational brethren, down to the lowest, which scarcely
apprehends at all; yet that organic pulp is the last product of
nature, which presupposes all the rest. But in itself, and outside
the idea, the brain also, like everything else, is will. For existing
for another is being perceived; being in itself is willing: upon
this it depends that on the purely objective path we never attain
to the inner nature of things; but if we attempt to find their inner
nature from without and empirically, this inner always becomes
an outer again in our hands,—the pith of the tree, as well as its
bark; the heart of the animal, as well as its hide; the white and
the yolk of an egg, as well as its shell. On the other hand, upon
the subjective path the inner is accessible to us at every moment;
for we find it as the will primarily in ourselves, and must, by
the clue of the analogy with our own nature, be able to solve
that of others, in that we attain to the insight that a being in
itself independent of being known, i.e., of exhibiting itself in an
intellect, is only conceivable as willing.

If now, in the objective comprehension of the intellect, we go
back as far as we possibly can, we shall find that the necessity or[008]
the need of knowledge in general arises from the multiplicity and
the separate existence of beings, thus from individuation. For
suppose there only existed a single being, such a being would
have no need of knowledge: because nothing would exist which
was different from it, and whose existence it would therefore
have to take up into itself indirectly through knowledge, i.e.,
image and concept. It would itself already be all in all, and
therefore there would remain nothing for it to know, i.e., nothing
foreign that could be apprehended as object. 

In the case of a multiplicity of beings, on the other hand, every individual finds
itself in a condition of isolation from all the rest, and hence arises
the necessity of knowledge. The nervous system, by means
of which the animal individual primarily becomes conscious of
itself, is bounded by a skin; yet in the brain that has attained
to intellect it passes beyond this limit by means of its form of
knowledge, causality, and thus there arises for it perception as a
consciousness of other things, as an image of beings in space and
time, which change in accordance with causality. In this sense it
would be more correct to say, “Only the different is known by
the different,” than as Empedocles said, “Only the like is known
by the like,” which was a very indefinite and ambiguous propo-
sition; although points of view may certainly also be conceived
from which it is true; as, for instance, we may observe in passing
that of Helvetius when he says so beautifully and happily: 

“Il n'y a que l'esprit qui sente l'esprit: c'est une corde qui ne frémit qu'à l'unison,” which corresponds with Xenophon's “√ø∆øΩ μπΩ±π ¥μπ ƒøΩ μ¿π≥Ω…√øºμΩøΩ ƒøΩ √ø∆øΩ” (sapientem esse opportet eum, qui sapientem agniturus sit), and is a great sorrow. 

But now, again, from the other side we know that multiplicity of similars only becomes possible through time and space; thus through the forms of our knowledge. Space first arises in that the knowing subject sees externally; it is the manner in which the subject comprehends something as different from itself. But we also saw [009]
knowledge in general conditioned by multiplicity and difference.
