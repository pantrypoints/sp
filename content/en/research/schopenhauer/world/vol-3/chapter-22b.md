Thus knowledge and multiplicity, or individuation, stand and fall together, for they reciprocally condition each other. Hence it must be inferred that, beyond the phenomenon in the true being of all things, to which time and space, and consequently also multiplicity, must be foreign, there can also be no knowledge. 

Buddhism defines this as Pratschna Paramita, i.e., that which is beyond all knowledge (J. J. Schmidt, “On the Maha-Jana and Pratschna Paramita”).

A “knowledge of things in themselves,” in the strictest sense of the word, would accordingly be already impossible from the fact that where the thing in itself begins knowledge ceases, and all knowledge is essentially concerned only with phenomena.

For it springs from a limitation, by which it is made necessary, in order to extend the limits.

For the objective consideration the brain is the efflorescence of the organism; therefore only where the latter has attained its highest perfection and complexity does the brain appear in its greatest development. 

But in the preceding chapter we have recognised the organism as the objectification of the will; therefore the brain
also, as a part of it, must belong to this objectification. 

Further, from the fact that the organism is only the visibility of the will, thus in itself is the will, I have deduced that every affection of the organism at once and directly affects the will, i.e., is felt as agreeable or painful. 

Yet, with the heightening of sensibility, in the higher development of the nervous system, the possibility arises that in the nobler, i.e., the objective, organs of sense (sight and hearing) the exquisitely delicate affections proper to them are perceived without in themselves and directly affecting the will, that is, without being either painful or agreeable, and that therefore they appear in consciousness as indifferent, merely perceived, sensations. 

But in the brain this heightening of sensibility reaches such a high degree that upon received impressions of sense a reaction even takes place, which does not proceed directly from the will, but is primarily a spontaneity of the function of understanding, which makes the transition from the directly perceived sensation of the senses to its cause; and since the brain then at once produces the form of space, there thus arises the perception of an external object. 

We may therefore regard the point at which the understanding makes the transition from the mere sensation upon the retina, which is still a mere affection of the body and therefore of the will, to the cause of that sensation, which it projects by means of its form of space, as something external and different from its own body, as the
boundary between the world as will and the world as idea, or as the birthplace of the latter. 

In man, however, the spontaneity of the activity of the brain, which in the last instance is certainly conferred by the will, goes further than mere perception and immediate comprehension of causal relations. 

It extends to the construction of abstract conceptions out of these perceptions, and to operating with these conceptions, i.e., to thinking, as that in
which his reason consists. Thoughts are therefore furthest removed from the affections of the body, which, since the body is
the objectification of the will, may, through increased intensity, pass at once into pain, even in the organs of sense. Accordingly
idea and thought may also be regarded as the efflorescence of the will, because they spring from the highest perfection and
development of the organism; but the organism, in itself and
apart from the idea, is the will. Of course, in my explanation, the
existence of the body presupposes the world of idea; inasmuch
as it also, as body or real object, is only in this world; and, on the
other hand, the idea itself just as much presupposes the body, for
it arises only through the function of an organ of the body. That
which lies at the foundation of the whole phenomenon, that in it
which alone has being in itself and is original, is exclusively the
will; for it is the will which through this very process assumes [011]
the form of the idea, i.e., enters the secondary existence of an
objective world, or the sphere of the knowable. Philosophers
before Kant, with few exceptions, approached the explanation of
the origin of our knowledge from the wrong side. They set out
from a so-called soul, an existence whose inner nature and pecu-
liar function consisted in thinking, and indeed quite specially in
abstract thinking, with mere conceptions, which belonged to it
the more completely the further they lay from all perception. (I
beg to refer here to the note at the end of § 6 of my prize essay on
the foundation of morals.) 

This soul has in some inconceivable
manner entered the body, and there it is only disturbed in its
pure thinking, first by impressions of the senses and perceptions,
still more by the desires which these excite, and finally by the emotions, nay, passions, to which these desires develop; while
the characteristic and original element of this soul is mere ab-
stract thinking, and given up to this it has only universals, inborn
conceptions, and æternæ veritates for its objects, and leaves
everything perceptible lying far below it. Hence, also, arises the
contempt with which even now “sensibility” and the "sensuous"
are referred to by professors of philosophy, nay, are even made
the chief source of immorality, while it is just the senses which
are the genuine and innocent source of all our knowledge, from
which all thinking must first borrow its material, for in combi-
nation with the a priori functions of the intellect they produce
the perception. One might really suppose that in speaking of
sensibility these gentlemen always think only of the pretended
sixth sense of the French. Thus, as we have said, in the process of
knowledge, its ultimate product was made that which is first and
original in it, and accordingly the matter was taken hold of by
the wrong end. According to my exposition, the intellect springs
from the organism, and thereby from the will, and hence could
not be without the latter. Thus, without the will it would also[012]
find no material to occupy it; for everything that is knowable is
just the objectification of the will.


The brain and its functions condition:
- the perception of the external world, or the consciousness of other things
- self-consciousness

The will in itself is without consciousness, and remains so in the greater part of its phenomena. 

The secondary world of idea must be added, in order that it may become conscious of itself, just as light only becomes visible through the bodies which reflect it, and without them loses
itself in darkness without producing any effect. Because the will,
with the aim of comprehending its relations to the external world,
produces a brain in the animal individual, the consciousness of
its own self arises in it, by means of the subject of knowledge,
which comprehends things as existing and the ego as willing.

The sensibility, which reaches its highest degree in the brain, but is yet dispersed through its different parts, must first of all collect all the rays of its activity, concentrate them, as it were, in a focus, which, however, does not lie without, as in the case of the concave mirror, but within, as in the convex mirror. With
this point now it first describes the line of time, upon which,
therefore, all that it presents to itself as idea must exhibit itself,
and which is the first and most essential form of all knowledge,
or the form of inner sense. 

This focus of the whole activity of the brain is what Kant called the synthetic unity of apperception (cf. vol. ii. p. 475). Only by means of this does the will become conscious of itself, because this focus of the activity of the brain,
or that which knows, apprehends itself as identical with its own
basis, from which it springs, that which wills; and thus the ego
arises. Yet this focus of the brain activity remains primarily a
mere subject of knowledge, and as such capable of being the cold
and impartial spectator, the mere guide and counsellor of the
will, and also of comprehending the external world in a purely
objective manner, without reference to the will and its weal or [013]
woe. But whenever it turns within, it recognises the will as the
basis of its own phenomenon, and therefore combines with it in
the consciousness of an ego. That focus of the activity of the
brain (or the subject of knowledge) is indeed, as an indivisible
point, simple, but yet is not on this account a substance (soul),
but a mere condition or state. That of which it is itself a condition
or state can only be known by it indirectly, as it were through
reflection. But the ceasing of this state must not be regarded
as the annihilation of that of which it is a state. This knowing
and conscious ego is related to the will, which is the basis of its
phenomenal appearance, as the picture in the focus of a concave
mirror is related to the mirror itself, and has, like that picture,
only a conditioned, nay, really a merely apparent, reality. Far
from being the absolutely first (as, for example, Fichte teaches),
it is at bottom tertiary, for it presupposes the organism, and the
organism presupposes the will. I admit that all that is said here is really only an image and a figure, and in part also hypothetical;
but we stand at a point to which thought can scarcely reach, not
to speak of proof. 

Compare this with what I have adduced at length on this subject in chapter 20.
Now, although the true being of everything that exists consists
in its will, and knowledge together with consciousness are only
added at the higher grades of the phenomenon as something
secondary, yet we find that the difference which the presence
and the different degree of consciousness places between one
being and another is exceedingly great and of important results.
The subjective existence of the plant we must think of as a weak
analogue, a mere shadow of comfort and discomfort; and even in
this exceedingly weak degree the plant knows only of itself, not
of anything outside of it. On the other hand, even the lowest ani-
mal standing next to it is forced by increased and more definitely
specified wants to extend the sphere of its existence beyond the[014]
limits of its own body. This takes place through knowledge. It
has a dim apprehension of its immediate surroundings, out of
which the motives for its action with a view to its own mainte-
nance arise. Thus accordingly the medium of motives appears,
and this is—the world existing objectively in time and space, the
world as idea, however weak, obscure, and dimly dawning this
first and lowest example of it may be. But it imprints itself ever
more and more distinctly, ever wider and deeper, in proportion
as in the ascending scale of animal organisations the brain is
ever more perfectly produced. This progress in the development
of the brain, thus of the intellect, and of the clearness of the
idea, at each of these ever higher grades is, however, brought
about by the constantly increasing and more complicated wants
of this phenomenon of the will. This must always first afford
the occasion for it, for without necessity nature (i.e., the will
which objectifies itself in it) produces nothing, least of all the
hardest of its productions—a more perfect brain: in consequence
of its lex parsimoniæ: natura nihil agit frustra et nihil facit supervacaneum. It has provided every animal with the organs
which are necessary for its sustenance and the weapons necessary
for its conflict, as I have shown at length in my work, “Ueber
den Willen in der Natur,” under the heading, “Vergleichende
Anatomie.” 

According to this measure, therefore, it imparts to each the most important of those organs concerned with what is
without, the brain, with its function the intellect. The more com-
plicated, through higher development, its organisation became,
the more multifarious and specially determined did its wants also
become, and consequently the more difficult and the more depen-
dent upon opportunity was the provision of what would satisfy
them. 

Thus there was needed here a wider range of sight, a more
accurate comprehension, a more correct distinction of things
in the external world, in all their circumstances and relations.
Accordingly we see the faculty of forming ideas, and its organs, [015]
brain, nerves, and special senses, appear ever more perfect the
higher we advance in the scale of animals; and in proportion as
the cerebral system develops, the external world appears ever
more distinct, many-sided, and complete in consciousness. The
comprehension of it now demands ever more attention, and ul-
timately in such a degree that sometimes its relation to the will
must momentarily be lost sight of in order that it may take place
more purely and correctly. Quite definitely this first appears
in the case of man. With him alone does a pure separation of
knowing and willing take place. This is an important point, which
I merely touch on here in order to indicate its position, and be
able to take it up again later. But, like all the rest, nature takes this
last step also in extending and perfecting the brain, and thereby
in increasing the powers of knowledge, only in consequence of
the increased needs, thus in the service of the will. What this
aims at and attains in man is indeed essentially the same, and
not more than what is also its goal in the brutes—nourishment
and propagation. 

But the requisites for the attainment of this
goal became so much increased in number, and of so much higher quality and greater definiteness through the organisation
of man, that a very much more considerable heightening of the
intellect than the previous steps demanded was necessary, or at
least was the easiest means of reaching the end. But since now
the intellect, in accordance with its nature, is a tool of the most
various utility, and is equally applicable to the most different
kinds of ends, nature, true to her spirit of parsimony, could now
meet through it alone all the demands of the wants which had
now become so manifold. Therefore she sent forth man without
clothing, without natural means of protection or weapons of
attack, nay, with relatively little muscular power, combined with
great frailty and little endurance of adverse influences and wants,
in reliance upon that one great tool, in addition to which she
had only to retain the hands from the next grade below him, the
ape. 

But through the predominating intellect which here appears[016]
not only is the comprehension of motives, their multiplicity,
and in general the horizon of the aims infinitely increased, but
also the distinctness with which the will is conscious of itself is
enhanced in the highest degree in consequence of the clearness
of the whole consciousness which has been brought about, which
is supported by the capacity for abstract knowledge, and now
attains to complete reflectiveness. But thereby, and also through
the vehemence of the will, which is necessarily presupposed
as the supporter of such a heightened intellect, an intensifying
of all the emotions appears, and indeed the possibility of the
passions, which, properly speaking, are unknown to the brute.
For the vehemence of the will keeps pace with the advance of
intelligence, because this advance really always springs from
the increased needs and pressing demands of the will: besides
this, however, the two reciprocally support each other. Thus the
vehemence of the character corresponds to the greater energy of
the beating of the heart and the circulation of the blood, which
physically heighten the activity of the brain. On the other hand,
the clearness of the intelligence intensifies the emotions, which
Chapter XXII. Objective View of the Intellect. 17
are called forth by the outward circumstances, by means of the
more vivid apprehension of the latter. Hence, for example,
young calves quietly allow themselves to be packed in a cart and
carried off; but young lions, if they are only separated from their
mother, remain permanently restless, and roar unceasingly from
morning to night; children in such a position would cry and vex
themselves almost to death. The vivaciousness and impetuosity
of the ape is in exact proportion to its greatly developed intellect.
It depends just on this reciprocal relationship that man is, in
general, capable of far greater sorrows than the brute, but also
of greater joy in satisfied and pleasing emotions. In the same
way his higher intelligence makes him more sensible to ennui
than the brute; but it also becomes, if he is individually very complete, an inexhaustible source of entertainment. Thus, as a
whole, the manifestation of the will in man is related to that in
the brute of the higher species, as a note that has been struck
to its fifth pitched two or three octaves lower. But between the
different kinds of brutes also the differences of intellect, and
thereby of consciousness, are great and endlessly graduated. The
mere analogy of consciousness which we must yet attribute to
plants will be related to the still far deader subjective nature of an
unorganised body, very much as the consciousness of the lowest
species of animals is related to the quasi consciousness of plants.
We may present to our imagination the innumerable gradations
in the degree of consciousness under the figure of the different
velocity of points which are unequally distant from the centre of
a revolving sphere. But the most correct, and indeed, as our third
book teaches, the natural figure of that gradation is afforded us
by the scale in its whole compass from the lowest audible note
to the highest. It is, however, the grade of consciousness which
determines the grade of existence of a being. For every imme-
diate existence is subjective: the objective existence is in the
consciousness of another, thus only for this other, consequently
quite indirect. Through the grade of consciousness beings are as different as through the will they are alike, for the will is what is
common to them all.
