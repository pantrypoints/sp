What happens between the plant and the animal, and then between the different species of animals, occurs also between man and man. 

Here also that which is secondary, the intellect, by means of the clearness of consciousness and distinctness of knowledge which depends upon it, constitutes a fundamental and immeasurably great difference in the whole
manner of the existence, and thereby in the grade of it. The higher
the consciousness has risen, the more distinct and connected are
the thoughts, the clearer the perceptions the more intense the
sensations. 

Through it everything gains more depth: emotion, sadness, joy, and sorrow. Commonplace blockheads are not even
capable of real joy: they live on in dull insensibility. While to one man his consciousness only presents his own existence,
together with the motives which must be apprehended for the purpose of sustaining and enlivening it, in a bare comprehension
of the external world, it is to another a camera obscura in which the macrocosm exhibits itself:

“He feels that he holds a little world
Brooding in his brain,
That it begins to work and to live,
That he fain would give it forth.”

The difference of the whole manner of existence which the
extremes of the gradation of intellectual capacity establish between man and man is so great that that between a king and a day labourer seems small in comparison. 

And here also, as in the case of the species of animals, a connection between the vehemence
of the will and the height of the intellect can be shown. Genius
is conditioned by a passionate temperament, and a phlegmatic
genius is inconceivable: it seems as if an exceptionally vehement,
thus a violently longing, will must be present if nature is to give an abnormally heightened intellect, as corresponding to it; while the merely physical account of this points to the greater energy
with which the arteries of the head move the brain and increase
its turgescence. Certainly, however, the quantity, quality, and
form of the brain itself is the other and incomparably more rare
condition of genius. On the other hand, phlegmatic persons are
as a rule of very moderate mental power; and thus the northern,
cold-blooded, and phlegmatic nations are in general noticeably
inferior in mind to the southern vivacious and passionate peoples;
although, as Bacon2 has most pertinently remarked, if once a
man of a northern nation is highly gifted by nature, he can then
reach a grade which no southern ever attains to. It is accordingly
as perverse as it is common to take the great minds of different [019]
nations as the standard for comparing their mental powers: for
that is just attempting to prove the rule by the exceptions. It is
rather the great majority of each nation that one has to consider:
for one swallow does not make a summer. We have further to
remark here that that very passionateness which is a condition of
genius, bound up with its vivid apprehension of things, produces
in practical life, where the will comes into play, and especially
in the case of sudden occurrences, so great an excitement of the
emotions that it disturbs and confuses the intellect; while the
phlegmatic man in such a case still retains the full use of his
mental faculties, though they are much more limited, and then
accomplishes much more with them than the greatest genius can
achieve. Accordingly a passionate temperament is favourable to
the original quality of the intellect, but a phlegmatic temperament
to its use. Therefore genius proper is only for theoretical achieve-
ments, for which it can choose and await its time, which will just
be the time at which the will is entirely at rest, and no waves
disturb the clear mirror of the comprehension of the world. 

On the other hand, genius is ill adapted and unserviceable for practical life, and is therefore for the most part unfortunate. Goethe's “Tasso” is written from this point of view. As now genius
proper depends upon the absolute strength of the intellect, which
must be purchased by a correspondingly excessive vehemence
of disposition, so, on the other hand, the great pre-eminence in
practical life that makes generals and statesmen depends upon
the relative strength of the intellect, thus upon the highest de-
gree of it that can be attained without too great excitability of
the emotions, and too great vehemence of character, and that
therefore can hold its own even in the storm. Great firmness
of will and constancy of mind, together with a capable and fine
understanding, are here sufficient; and whatever goes beyond
this acts detrimentally, for too great a development of the in-[020]
telligence directly impedes firmness of character and resolution
of will. Hence this kind of eminence is not so abnormal, and is
a hundred times less rare than the former kind; and accordingly
we see great generals and great ministers appear in every age,
whenever the merely external conditions are favourable to their
efficiency. Great poets and philosophers, on the other hand, leave
centuries waiting for them; and yet humanity may be contented
even with this rare appearance of them, for their works remain,
and do not exist only for the present, like the achievements of
those other men. It is also quite in keeping with the law of
the parsimony of nature referred to above that it bestows great
eminence of mind in general upon very few, and genius only
as the rarest of all exceptions, while it equips the great mass of
the human race with no more mental power than is required for
the maintenance of the individual and the species. For the great,
and through their very satisfaction, constantly increasing needs
of the human race make it necessary that the great majority of
men should pass their lives in occupations of a coarsely physical
and entirely mechanical description. And what would be the
use to them of an active mind, a glowing imagination, a subtle
understanding, and a profoundly penetrating intellect? 

These would only make them useless and unhappy. Therefore nature
has thus gone about the most costly of all her productions in
the least extravagant manner. In order not to judge unfairly one
ought also to settle definitely one's expectations of the mental
achievements of men generally from this point of view, and
to regard, for example, even learned men, since as a rule they
have become so only by the force of outward circumstances,
primarily as men whom nature really intended to be tillers of the
soil; indeed even professors of philosophy ought to be estimated
according to this standard, and then their achievements will be
found to come up to all fair expectations. It is worth noticing that
in the south, where the necessities of life press less severely upon [021]
the human race, and more leisure is allowed, the mental faculties
even of the multitude also become more active and finer. It is
physiologically noteworthy that the preponderance of the mass
of the brain over that of the spinal cord and the nerves, which,
according to Sömmerring's acute discovery, affords the true and
closest measure of the degree of intelligence both of species
of brutes and of individual men, at the same time increases the
direct power of moving, the agility of the limbs; because, through
the great inequality of the relation, the dependence of all motor
nerves upon the brain becomes more decided; and besides this
the cerebellum, which is the primary controller of movements,
shares the qualitative perfection of the cerebrum; thus through
both all voluntary movements gain greater facility, rapidity, and
manageableness, and by the concentration of the starting-point of
all activity that arises which Lichtenberg praises in Garrick: “that
he appeared to be present in all the muscles of his body.” Hence
clumsiness in the movement of the body indicates clumsiness in
the movement of the thoughts, and will be regarded as a sign of
stupidity both in individuals and nations, as much as sleepiness
of the countenance and vacancy of the glance. Another symptom
of the physiological state of the case referred to is the fact that
many persons are obliged at once to stand still whenever their conversation with any one who is walking with them begins to
gain some connection; because their brain, as soon as it has to
link together a few thoughts, has no longer as much power over
as is required to keep the limbs in motion by means of the motory
nerves, so closely is everything measured with them.
It results from this whole objective consideration of the intel-
lect and its origin, that it is designed for the comprehension of
those ends upon the attainment of which depends the individual
life and its propagation, but by no means for deciphering the
inner nature of things and of the world, which exists indepen-
dently of the knower.

What to the plant is the susceptibility[022]
to light, in consequence of which it guides its growth in the
direction of it, that is, in kind, the knowledge of the brute, nay,
even of man, although in degree it is increased in proportion
as the needs of each of these beings demand. With them all
apprehension remains a mere consciousness of their relations to
other things, and is by no means intended to present again in the
consciousness of the knower the peculiar, absolutely real nature
of these things. Rather, as springing from the will, the intellect
is also only designed for its service, thus for the apprehension of
motives; it is adapted for this, and is therefore of a thoroughly
practical tendency. This also holds good if we conceive the
significance of life as ethical; for in this regard too we find man
knowing only for the benefit of his conduct. Such a faculty of
knowledge, existing exclusively for practical ends, will from its
nature always comprehend only the relations of things to each
other, but not the inner nature of them, as it is in itself. But to
regard the complex of these relations as the absolute nature of
the world as it is in itself, and the manner in which it necessarily
exhibits itself in accordance with the laws predisposed in the
brain as the eternal laws of the existence of all things, and then to
construct ontology, cosmology, and theology in accordance with
this view—this was really the old fundamental error, of which
Kant's teaching has made an end. Here, then, our objective, and therefore for the most part physiological consideration of the intellect meets his transcendental consideration of it; nay,
appears in a certain sense even as an a priori insight into it;
for, from a point of view which we have taken up outside of
it, our objective view enables us to know in its origin, and
therefore as necessary, what that transcendental consideration,
starting from facts of consciousness, presents only as a matter
of fact. For it follows from our objective consideration of the
intellect, that the world as idea, as it exists stretched out in space
and time, and moves on regularly according to the strict law [023]
of causality, is primarily only a physiological phenomenon, a
function of the brain, which brings it about, certainly upon the
occasion of certain external stimuli, but yet in conformity with
its own laws.

Accordingly it is beforehand a matter of course, that what goes on in this function itself, and therefore through it
and for it, must by no means be regarded as the nature of things
in themselves, which exist independently of it and are entirely
different from it, but primarily exhibits only the mode or manner
of this function itself, which can always receive only a very
subordinate modification through that which exists completely
independently of it, and sets it in motion as a stimulus. As, then,
Locke claimed for the organs of sense all that comes into our
apprehension by means of the sensation, in order to deny that it
belongs to things in themselves, so Kant, with the same intention,
and pursuing the same path further, has proved all that makes
perception proper possible, thus space, time, and causality, to
be functions of the brain; although he has refrained from using
this physiological expression, to which, however, our present
method of investigation, coming from the opposite side, the side
of the real, necessarily leads us. Kant arrived upon his analytical
path at the result that what we know are mere phenomena. What
this mysterious expression really means becomes clear from our
objective and genetic investigation of the intellect. 

The phenomena are the motives for the aims of individual will as they exhibit themselves in the intellect which the will has produced for
this purpose (which itself appears as a phenomenon objectively,
as the brain), and which, when comprehended, as far as one
can follow their concatenation, afford us in their connection the
world which extends itself objectively in time and space, and
which I call the world as idea. Moreover, from our point of
view, the objectionable element vanishes which in the Kantian
doctrine arises from the fact that, because the intellect knows[024]
merely phenomena instead of things as they are in themselves,
nay, in consequence of this is led astray into paralogisms and
unfounded hypostases by means of “sophistications, not of men
but of the reason itself, from which even the wisest does not free
himself, and if, perhaps indeed after much trouble, he avoids
error, can yet never get quit of the illusion which unceasing-
ly torments and mocks him”—because of all this, I say, the
appearance arises that our intellect is intentionally designed to
lead us into errors. For the objective view of the intellect given
here, which contains a genesis of it, makes it conceivable that,
being exclusively intended for practical ends, it is merely the
medium of motives, and therefore fulfils its end by an accurate
presentation of these, and that if we undertake to discover the
nature of things in themselves, from the manifold phenomena
which here exhibit themselves objectively to us, and their laws,
we do this at our own peril and on our own responsibility.
