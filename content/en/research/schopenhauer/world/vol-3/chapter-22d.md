The original inner force of nature, without knowledge and working in the dark, which, if it has worked its way up to self-consciousness, reveals itself to this as will,
attains to this grade only by the production of an animal brain
and of knowledge, as its function, whereupon the phenomenon
of the world of perception arises in this brain. But to explain
this mere brain phenomenon, with the conformity to law which
is invariably connected with its functions, as the objective inner
nature of the world and the things in it, which is independent of
the brain, existing before and after it, is clearly a spring which nothing warrants us in making. From this mundus phœnomenon, however, from this perception which arises under such a variety
of conditions, all our conceptions are drawn. They have all their
content from it, or even only in relation to it. Therefore, as Kant
says, they are only for immanent, not for transcendental, use; that
is to say, these conceptions of ours, this first material of thought,
and consequently still more the judgments which result from [025]
their combination, are unfitted for the task of thinking the nature
of things in themselves, and the true connection of the world and
existence; indeed, to undertake this is analogous to expressing
the stereometrical content of a body in square inches. For our in-
tellect, originally only intended to present to an individual will its
paltry aims, comprehends accordingly mere relations of things,
and does not penetrate to their inner being, to their real nature.
It is therefore a merely superficial force, clings to the surface
of things, and apprehends mere species transitivas, not the true
being of things. From this it arises that we cannot understand and
comprehend any single thing, even the simplest and smallest,
through and through, but something remains entirely inexplicable
to us in each of them. Just because the intellect is a product of
nature, and is therefore only intended for its ends, the Christian
mystics have very aptly called it “the light of nature,” and driven
it back within its limits; for nature is the object to which alone
it is the subject. The thought from which the Critique of Pure
Reason has sprung really lies already at the foundation of this
expression. That we cannot comprehend the world on the direct
path, i.e., through the uncritical, direct application of the intellect
and its data, but when we reflect upon it become ever more
deeply involved in insoluble mysteries, points to the fact that the
intellect, thus knowledge itself, is secondary, a mere product,
brought about by the development of the inner being of the world,
which consequently till then preceded it, and it at last appeared
as a breaking through to the light out of the obscure depths of the
unconscious striving the nature of which exhibits itself as will to the self-consciousness which now at once arises. 

That which preceded knowledge as its condition, whereby it first became
possible, thus its own basis, cannot be directly comprehended by
it; as the eye cannot see itself. It is rather the relations of one
existence to another, exhibiting themselves upon the surface of[026]
things, which alone are its affair, and are so only by means of the
apparatus of the intellect, its forms, space, time, and causality.
Just because the world has made itself without the assistance of
knowledge, its whole being does not enter into knowledge, but
knowledge presupposes the existence of the world; on which
account the origin of the world does not lie within its sphere. It
is accordingly limited to the relations between the things which
lie before it, and is thus sufficient for the individual will, for the
service of which alone it appeared. For the intellect is, as has
been shown, conditioned by nature, lies in it, belongs to it, and
cannot therefore place itself over against it as something quite
foreign to it, in order thus to take up into itself its whole nature,
absolutely, objectively, and thoroughly. It can, if fortune favours
it, understand all that is in nature, but not nature itself, at least
not directly.

However discouraging to metaphysics this essential limitation
of the intellect may be, which arises from its nature and origin, it
has yet another side which is very consoling. It deprives the direct
utterances of nature of their unconditional validity, in the asser-
tion of which naturalism proper consists. If, therefore, nature
presents to us every living thing as appearing out of nothing, and,
after an ephemeral existence, returning again for ever to nothing,
and if it seems to take pleasure in the unceasing production of
new beings, in order that it may be able unceasingly to destroy,
and, on the other hand, is unable to bring anything permanent
to light; if accordingly we are forced to recognise matter as that
which alone is permanent, which never came into being and
never passes away, but brings forth all things from its womb,
whence its name appears to be derived from mater rerum, and along with it, as the father of things, form, which, just as fleeting as matter is permanent, changes really every moment, and can
only maintain itself so long as it clings as a parasite to matter
(now to one part of it, now to another), but when once it entirely [027]
loses hold, disappears, as is shown by the palæotheria and the
ichthyosaurians, we must indeed recognise this as the direct and
genuine utterance of nature, but on account of the origin of the
intellect explained above, and the nature of it which results from
this origin, we cannot ascribe to this utterance an unconditional
truth, but rather only an entirely conditional truth, which Kant
has appropriately indicated as such by calling it the phenomenon
in opposition to the thing in itself.

If, in spite of this essential limitation of the intellect, it is possible, by a circuitous route, to arrive at a certain understanding of the world and the nature of things, by means of reflection widely pursued, and the skilful combination of objective knowledge directed towards without, with the data of self-consciousness, this will yet be only a very limited, entirely indirect, and relative understanding, a parabolical translation into the forms of knowl-
edge, thus a quadam prodire tenus, which must always leave
many problems still unsolved. On the other hand, the fundamental
error of the old dogmatism in all its forms, which was destroyed
by Kant, was this, that it started absolutely from knowledge, i.e.,
the world as idea, in order to deduce and construct from its laws
being in general, whereby it accepted that world of idea, together
with its laws, as absolutely existing and absolutely real; while
its whole existence is throughout relative, and a mere result or
phenomenon of the true being which lies at its foundation,—or,
in other words, that it constructed an ontology when it had only
materials for a dianoiology. 

Kant discovered the subjectively conditioned and therefore entirely immanent nature of knowledge, i.e., its unsuitableness for transcendental use, from the constitution of knowledge itself; and therefore he very appropriately called his doctrine the Critique of Reason. 

He accomplished this partly by showing the important and thoroughly a priori part
of all knowledge, which, as throughout subjective, spoils all[028]
objectivity, and partly by professedly proving that if they were
followed out to the end the principles of knowledge, taken as
purely objective, led to contradictions. He had, however, hastily
assumed that, apart from objective knowledge, i.e., apart from the
world as idea, there is nothing given us except conscience, out of
which he constructed the little that still remained of metaphysics,
his moral theology, to which, however, he attributed absolutely
only a practical validity, and no theoretical validity at all. He
had overlooked that although certainly objective knowledge, or
the world as idea, affords nothing but phenomena, together with
their phenomenal connection and regressus, yet our own nature
necessarily also belongs to the world of things in themselves, for
it must have its root in it. But here, even if the root itself cannot
be brought to light, it must be possible to gather some data for
the explanation of the connection of the world of phenomena
with the inner nature of things. Thus here lies the path upon
which I have gone beyond Kant and the limits which he drew, yet
always restricting myself to the ground of reflection, and con-
sequently of honesty, and therefore without the vain pretension
of intellectual intuition or absolute thought which characterises
the period of pseudo-philosophy between Kant and me. In his
proof of the insufficiency of rational knowledge to fathom the
nature of the world Kant started from knowledge as a fact, which
our consciousness affords us, thus in this sense he proceeded a
posteriori. But in this chapter, and also in my work, “Ueber den
Willen in der Natur,” I have sought to show what knowledge
is in its nature and origin, something secondary, designed for
individual ends; whence it follows that it must be insufficient to
fathom the nature of the world. Thus so far I have reached the
same goal a priori. But one never knows anything wholly and
completely until one has gone right round it for that purpose,
and has got back to it from the opposite side from which one started. Therefore also, in the case of the important fundamental knowledge here considered, one must not merely go from the
intellect to the knowledge of the world, as Kant has done, but
also from the world, taken as given, to the intellect, as I have
undertaken here. Then this physiological consideration, in the
wider sense, becomes the supplement of that ideological, as the
French say, or, more accurately, transcendental consideration.

In the above, in order not to break the thread of the exposition,
I have postponed the explanation of one point which I touched
upon. It was this, that in proportion as, in the ascending series of
animals, the intellect appears ever more developed and complete,
knowledge always separates itself more distinctly from will, and
thereby becomes purer. What is essential upon this point will
be found in my work, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” under
the heading, “Pflanzenphysiologie” (p. 68-72 of the second, and
74-77 of the third edition), to which I refer, in order to avoid
repetition, and merely add here a few remarks. Since the plant
possesses neither irritability nor sensibility, but the will objecti-
fies itself in it only as plastic or reproductive power, it has neither
muscle nor nerve. In the lowest grades of the animal kingdom,
in zoophites, especially in polyps, we cannot as yet distinctly
recognise the separation of these two constituent parts, but still
we assume their existence, though in a state of fusion; because we
perceive movements which follow, not, as in the case of plants,
upon mere stimuli, but upon motives, i.e., in consequence of a
certain apprehension. Now in proportion as, in the ascending se-
ries of animals, the nervous and muscular systems separate ever
more distinctly from each other, till in the vertebrate animals, and
most completely in man, the former divides into an organic and
a cerebral nervous system, and of these the latter again develops
into the excessively complicated apparatus of the cerebrum and
cerebellum, spinal marrow, cerebral and spinal nerves, sensory
and motor nerve fascicles, of which only the cerebrum, together [030]
with the sensory nerves depending upon it, and the posterior spinal nerve fascicles are intended for the apprehension of the
motive from the external world, while all the other parts are in-
tended for the transmission of the motive to the muscles in which
the will manifests itself directly; in the same proportion does the
motive separate ever more distinctly in consciousness from the
act of will which it calls forth, thus the idea from the will; and
thereby the objectivity of consciousness constantly increases, for
the ideas exhibit themselves ever more distinctly and purely in
it. These two separations are, however, really only one and
the same, which we have here considered from two sides, the
objective and the subjective, or first in the consciousness of other
things and then in self-consciousness. Upon the degree of this
separation ultimately depends the difference and the gradation of
intellectual capacity, both between different kinds of animals and
between individual human beings; thus it gives the standard for
the intellectual completeness of these beings. For the clearness
of the consciousness of the external world, the objectivity of the
perception, depends upon it. In the passage referred to above I
have shown that the brute only perceives things so far as they
are motives for its will, and that even the most intelligent of the
brutes scarcely overstep these limits, because their intellect is
too closely joined to the will from which it has sprung. On the
other hand, even the stupidest man comprehends things in some
degree objectively; for he recognises not merely what they are
with reference to him, but also something of what they are with
reference to themselves and to other things. Yet in the case of
very few does this reach such a degree that they are in a position
to examine and judge of anything purely objectively; but “that
must I do, that must I say, that must I believe,” is the goal to
which on every occasion their thought hastens in a direct line,
and at which their understanding at once finds welcome rest. For
thinking is as unendurable to the weak head as the lifting of a burden to the weak arm; therefore both hasten to set it down. 

The
objectivity of knowledge, and primarily of perceptive knowledge, has innumerable grades, which depend upon the energy
of the intellect and its separation from the will, and the highest
of which is genius, in which the comprehension of the external
world becomes so pure and objective that to it even more reveals
itself directly in the individual thing than the individual thing
itself, namely, the nature of its whole species, i.e., its Platonic
Idea; which is brought about by the fact that in this case the will
entirely vanishes from consciousness. Here is the point at which
the present investigation, starting from physiological grounds,
connects itself with the subject of our third book, the metaphysics
of the beautiful, where æsthetic comprehension proper, which,
in a high degree, is peculiar to genius alone, is fully considered
as the condition of pure, i.e., perfectly will-less, and on that
account completely objective knowledge. According to what has
been said, the rise of intelligence, from the obscurest animal
consciousness up to that of man, is a progressive loosening of the
intellect from the will, which appears complete, although only as
an exception, in the genius. Therefore genius may be defined as
the highest grade of the objectivity of knowledge. The condition
of this, which so seldom occurs, is a decidedly larger measure
of intelligence than is required for the service of the will, which
constitutes its basis; it is accordingly this free surplus which first
really properly comes to know the world, i.e., comprehends it
perfectly objectively, and now paints pictures, composes poems,
and thinks in accordance with this comprehension.
