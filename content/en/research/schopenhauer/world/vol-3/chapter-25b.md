The internal construction of insects has infinite care and unwearied labour of Nature.

This is repeated an infinite number of times in each one of individuals of every kind.

It acts the same on even the most lonely, neglected unseen spot.

<!-- if we now follow the combination of
the parts of every organism as far as we can, and yet never come
upon one part which is quite simple, and therefore ultimate, not to speak of one which is inorganic; 

if, finally, we lose ourselves in calculating the design of all those parts of the organism for the
maintenance of the whole by virtue of which every living thing
is complete in and for itself; if we consider at the same time that
each of these masterpieces, itself of short duration, has already
been produced anew an innumerable number of times, and yet  -->

Every example of a species, insect, flower appears just as carefully perfected as was the first of its kind.

Nature does not get weary or bungles. Instead, it perfects the last like the first.

Human art is completely different in degree and in kind from the works of nature.

<!--  and, next, that the working force, the natura
naturans, in each of its innumerable works, in the least as in the
greatest, in the last as in the first, is immediately present whole
and undivided, from which it follows that, as such and in itself,
it knows nothing of space and time.  -->

The production of these hyperboles of all works of art costs nature absolutely nothing.

She can create millions of organisms which never attain to maturity, and
without sparing exposes every living thing to a thousand accidents, yet, on the other hand, if favoured by chance or directed by human purpose, readily affords millions of examples of a species
of which hitherto there was only one, so that millions cost her no
more than one; 

This also leads us to see that the multiplicity of things has its root in the nature of the knowledge of the subject,
but is foreign to the thing in itself, i.e., to the inner primary force
which shows itself in things; that consequently space and time,
upon which the possibility of all multiplicity depends, are mere
forms of our perception; nay, that even that whole inconceivable
ingenuity of structure associated with the reckless prodigality of
the works upon which it has been expended ultimately springs
simply from the way in which things are apprehended by us; for
when the simple and indivisible original effort of the will exhibits itself as object in our cerebral knowledge, it must appear as an ingenious combination of separate parts, as means and ends of 
each other, accomplished with wonderful completeness.

The unity of that will, here referred to, which lies beyond
the phenomenon, and in which we have recognised the inner
nature of the phenomenal world, is a metaphysical unity, and
consequently transcends the knowledge of it, i.e., does not de-
pend upon the functions of our intellect, and therefore can not
really be comprehended by it. Hence it arises that it opens
to the consideration an abyss so profound that it admits of no
thoroughly clear and systematically connected insight, but grants
us only isolated glances, which enable us to recognise this unity
in this and that relation of things, now in the subjective, now in
the objective sphere, whereby, however, new problems are again
raised, all of which I will not engage to solve, but rather appeal
here to the words est quadam prodire tenus, more concerned to
set up nothing false or arbitrarily invented than to give a thorough
account of all;—at the risk of giving here only a fragmentary
exposition.

If we call up to our minds and distinctly go through in thought [072]
the exceedingly acute theory of the origin of the planetary system,
first put forth by Kant and later by Laplace, a theory of which it
is scarcely possible to doubt the correctness, we see the lowest,
crudest, and blindest forces of nature bound to the most rigid
conformity to law, by means of their conflict for one and the same
given matter, and the accidental results brought about by this produce the framework of the world, thus of the designedly prepared future dwelling-place of innumerable living beings, as a system
of order and harmony, at which we are the more astonished the
more distinctly and accurately we come to understand it. 

For
example, if we see that every planet, with its present velocity,
can only maintain itself exactly where it actually has its place,
because if it were brought nearer to the sun it would necessarily
fall into it, or if placed further from it would necessarily fly away from it; how, conversely, if we take the place as given, it can only remain there with its present velocity and no other, because
if it went faster it would necessarily fly away from the sun, and
if it went slower it would necessarily fall into it; that thus only
one definite place is suitable to each definite velocity of a planet;
and if we now see this solved by the fact that the same physical,
necessary, and blindly acting cause which appointed it its place,
at the same time and just by doing so, imparted to it exactly the
only velocity suitable for this place, in consequence of the law of
nature that a revolving body increases its velocity in proportion
as its revolution becomes smaller; and, moreover, if finally we
understand how endless permanence is assured to the whole
system, by the fact that all the mutual disturbances of the course
of the planets which unavoidably enter, must adjust themselves
in time; how then it is just the irrationality of the periods of
revolution of Jupiter and Saturn to each other that prevents their
respective perturbations from repeating themselves at one place,
whereby they would become dangerous, and brings it about that,
appearing seldom and always at a different place, they must sublate themselves again, like dissonances in music which are
again resolved into harmony. By means of such considerations
we recognise a design and perfection, such as could only have
been brought about by the freest absolute will directed by the
most penetrating understanding and the most acute calculation.

Under the guidance of that cosmogony of Laplace, so
well thought out and so accurately calculated, we cannot prevent
ourselves from seeing that perfectly blind forces of nature, acting
according to unalterable natural laws, through their conflict and
aimless play among themselves, could produce nothing else but
this very framework of the world, which is equal to the work
of an extraordinarily enhanced power of combination. Instead
now, after the manner of Anaxagoras, of dragging in the aid
of an intelligence known to us only from animal nature, and
adapted only to its aims, an intelligence which, coming from without, cunningly made use of the existing forces of nature and their laws in order to carry out its ends, which are foreign to
these,—we recognise in these lowest forces of nature themselves
that same, one will, which indeed first manifests itself in them,
and already in this manifestation striving after its goal, through
its original laws themselves works towards its final end, to which
therefore all that happens according to blind laws of nature must
minister and correspond. And this indeed cannot be otherwise,
because everything material is nothing but just the phenomenal
appearance, the visibility, the objectivity of the will to live which
is one. Thus even the lowest forces of nature themselves are
animated by that same will, which afterwards, in the individual
beings provided with intelligence, marvels at its own work, as
the somnambulist wonders in the morning at what he has done
in his sleep; or, more accurately, which is astonished at its own
form which it beholds in the mirror. This unity which is here
proved of the accidental with the intentional, of the necessary
with the free, on account of which the blindest chances, which, [074]
however, rest upon universal laws of nature, are as it were the
keys upon which the world-spirit plays its melodies so full of
significance,—this unity, I say, is, as has already been remarked,
an abyss in the investigation into which even philosophy can
throw no full light, but only a glimmer.

But I now turn to a subjective consideration belonging to this
place, to which, however, I am able to give still less distinctness
than to the objective consideration which has just been set forth;
for I shall only be able to express it by images and similes.
Why is our consciousness brighter and more distinct the further
it extends towards without, so that its greatest clearness lies in
sense perception, which already half belongs to things outside
us,—and, on the other hand, grows dimmer as we go in, and
leads, if followed to its inmost recesses, to a darkness in which all
knowledge ceases? Because, I say, consciousness presupposes
individuality; but this belongs to the mere phenomenon, for it is conditioned by the forms of the phenomenon, space and time, as multiplicity of the similar. Our inner nature, on the other
hand, has its root in that which is no longer phenomenon, but
thing in itself, to which, therefore, the forms of the phenomenon
do not extend; and thus the chief conditions of individuality are
wanting, and with these the distinctness of consciousness falls
off. In this root of existence the difference of beings ceases,
like that of the radii of a sphere in the centre; and as in the
sphere the surface is produced by the radii ending and breaking
off, so consciousness is only possible where the true inner being
runs out into the phenomenon, through whose forms the sepa-
rate individuality becomes possible upon which consciousness
depends, which is just on that account confined to phenomena.

Therefore all that is distinct and thoroughly comprehensible in
our consciousness always lies without upon this surface of the
sphere. Whenever, on the contrary, we withdraw entirely from
this, consciousness forsakes us,—in sleep, in death, to a certain[075]
extent also in magnetic or magic influences; for these all lead
through the centre. But just because distinct consciousness, being
confined to the surface of the sphere, is not directed towards the
centre, it recognises other individuals certainly as of the same
kind, but not as identical, which yet in themselves they are.
Immortality of the individual might be compared to a point of
the surface flying off at a tangent. But immortality, by virtue of
the eternal nature of the inner being of the whole phenomenon,
may be compared to the return of that point, on the radius, to the
centre, of which the whole surface is just the extension. The will
as the thing in itself is whole and undivided in every being, as the
centre is an integral part of every radius; while the peripherical
end of this radius is in the most rapid revolution, with the surface,
which represents time and its content, the other end, at the cen-
tre, which represents eternity, remains in the profoundest peace,
because the centre is the point of which the rising half is not
different from the sinking. 

Therefore in the Bhagavad-gita it is said: “Haud distributum animantibus, et quasi distributum tamen
insidens, animantiumque sustentaculum id cognoscendum, edax
et rursus genitale” (Lect. 13, 16 vers. Schlegel). 

We fall here into mystical and figurative language, but it is the
only language in which anything can be said on this entirely
transcendent theme. So this simile also may pass. The human
race may be imagined as an animal compositum, a form of life
of which many polypi, especially those which swim, such as
Veretillum, Funiculina, and others, afford examples. As in these
the head isolates each individual animal, and the lower part, with
the common stomach, combines them all in the unity of one life
process, so the brain with its consciousness isolates the human
individual, while the unconscious part, the vegetative life with
its ganglion system, into which in sleep the brain-consciousness
disappears, like a lotus which nightly sinks in the flood, is a common life of all, by means of which in exceptional cases they
can even communicate, as, for example, occurs when dreams
communicate themselves directly, the thoughts of the mesmeriser
pass into the somnambulist, and finally also in the magnetic or
generally magical influence proceeding from intentional willing.

Such an influence, if it occurs, is toto genere different from every
other on account of the influxus physicus which takes place, for it
is really an actio in distans which the will, certainly proceeding
from the individual, yet performs in its metaphysical quality as
the omnipresent substratum of the whole of nature. One might
also say that as in the generatio æquivoca there sometimes and
as an exception appears a weak residue of the original creative
power of the will, which in the existing forms of nature has
already done its work and is extinguished, so there may be,
exceptionally, acting in these magical influences, as it were, a
surplus of its original omnipotence, which completes its work
and spends itself in the construction and maintenance of the
organisms. I have spoken fully of this magical property of the
will in “The Will in Nature,” and I gladly omit here discussions which have to appeal to uncertain facts, which yet cannot be
altogether ignored or denied.
