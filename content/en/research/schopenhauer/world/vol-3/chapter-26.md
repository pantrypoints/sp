<!-- 4 This chapter and the following one are connected with § 28 of the first volume. -->

The universal teleology or design of organised nature relative to the continuance of every existing being, together with the adaptation of organised to unorganised nature, cannot without violence enter into the connection of any philosophical system except that one which makes a will the basis of the existence of every natural being; a will which accordingly expresses its nature and tendency not merely in the actions, but already in the form of the phenomenal organism. 

In the preceding chapter I have merely indicated the account which our system of thought gives of this subject, since I have already expounded it in the passage of the first volume referred to below, and with special clearness and fulness in “The Will in Nature,” under the rubric “Comparative Anatomy.”

The astounding amazement which is wont to take possession of us when we consider the endless design displayed in the con- struction of organised beings ultimately rests upon the certainly natural but yet false assumption that that adaptation of the parts to each other, to the whole of the organism and to its aims in the external world, as we comprehend it and judge of it by means of knowledge, thus upon the path of the idea, has also come into being upon the same path; thus that as it exists for the intellect, it was also brought about by the intellect. We certainly can only bring about something regular and conforming to law, such, [078] for example, as every crystal is, under the guidance of the law and the rule; and in the same way, we can only bring about something designed under the guidance of the conception of the end; but we are by no means justified in imputing this limitation of ours to nature, which is itself prior to all intellect, and whose action is entirely different in kind from ours, as was said in the preceding chapter. It accomplishes that which appears so designed and planned without reflection and without conception of an end, because without idea, which is of quite secondary origin. Let us first consider what is merely according to rule, not yet adapted to ends.

The 6 equal radii of a snowflake, separating
at equal angles, are measured beforehand by no knowledge; but
it is the simple tendency of the original will, which so exhibits
itself to knowledge when knowledge appears. As now here the
will brings about the regular figure without mathematics, so
also without physiology does it bring about the form which is
organised and furnished with organs evidently adapted to special
ends. The regular form in space only exists for the perception, the
perceptive form of which is space; so the design of the organism
only exists for the knowing reason, the reflection of which is
bound to the conceptions of end and means. 

If direct insight into
the working of nature was possible for us, we would necessarily
recognise that the wonder excited by teleology referred to above
is analogous to that which that savage referred to by Kant in his
explanation of the ludicrous felt when he saw the froth irresistibly
foaming out of a bottle of beer which had just been opened, and
expressed his wonder not that it should come out, but that any
one had ever been able to get it in; for we also assume that the
teleology of natural productions has been put in the same as it
comes out for us. Therefore our astonishment at design may
likewise be compared to that which the first productions of the
art of printing excited in those who considered them under the
supposition that they were works of the pen, and therefore had[079]
to resort to the assumption of the assistance of a devil in order to
explain them. For, let it be said again, it is our intellect which by
means of its own forms, space, time, and causality, apprehends
as object the act of will, in itself metaphysical and indivisible,
which exhibits itself in the phenomenon of an animal,—it is
our intellect which first produces the multiplicity and diversity
of the parts, and is then struck with amazement at their perfect agreement and conspiring together, which proceeds from the
original unity; whereby then, in a certain sense, it marvels at its
own work.

If we give ourselves up to the contemplation of the indescrib-
ably and infinitely ingenious construction of any animal, even if
it were only the commonest insect, lose ourselves in admiration
of it, and it now occurs to us that nature recklessly exposes
even this exceedingly ingenious and highly complicated organ-
ism daily and by thousands to destruction by accident, animal
rapacity, and human wantonness, this wild prodigality fills us
with amazement; but our amazement is based upon an ambiguity
of the conceptions, for we have in our minds the human work
of art which is accomplished by the help of the intellect and
by overcoming a foreign and resisting material, and therefore
certainly costs much trouble. Nature's works, on the contrary,
however ingenious they may be, cost her absolutely no trouble;
for here the will to work is already the work itself, since, as has
already been said, the organism is merely the visibility of the
will which is here present, brought about in the brain.
In consequence of the nature of organised beings which has
been set forth, teleology, as the assumption of the adaptation of
every part to its end, is a perfectly safe guide in considering the
whole of organised nature; on the other hand, in a metaphysical
regard, for the explanation of nature beyond the possibility of
experience, it must only be regarded as valid in a secondary
and subsidiary manner for the confirmation of principles of [080]
explanation which are otherwise established: for here it belongs
to the problems which have to be given account of. Accordingly,
if in some animal a part is found of which we do not see any use,
we must never venture the conjecture that nature has produced
it aimlessly, perhaps trifling, or out of mere caprice. 

Certainly it is possible to conceive something of this kind under the
Anaxagorean assumption that the disposition of nature has been
brought about by means of an ordering understanding, which, as such, obeys a foreign will; but not under the assumption that the true inner being (i.e., outside of our idea) of every organism is
simply and solely its own will; for then the existence of every
part is conditioned by the circumstance that in some way it serves
the will which here lies at its foundation, expresses and realises
some tendency of it, and consequently in some way contributes
to the maintenance of this organism. For apart from the will
which manifests itself in it, and the conditions of the external
world under which this has voluntarily undertaken to live, for
the conflict with which its whole form and disposition is already
adapted, nothing can have influenced it and determined its form
and parts, thus no arbitrary power, no caprice. On this account
everything in it must be designed; and therefore final causes
(causæ finales) are the clue to the understanding of organised
nature, as efficient causes (causæ efficientes) are the clue to the
understanding of unorganised nature. It depends upon this, that
if in anatomy or zoology, we cannot find the end or aim of an
existing part, our understanding receives a shock similar to that
which it receives in physics from an effect whose cause remains
concealed; and as we assume the latter as necessary, so also we
assume the former, and therefore go on searching for it, however
long we may already have done so in vain. This is, for example,
the case with the spleen, as to the use of which men never cease
inventing hypotheses, till some day one shall have proved itself
correct. So is it also with the large spiral-formed teeth of the[081]
babyroussa, the horn-shaped excrescences of certain caterpillars,
and more of the like. Negative cases are also judged by us
according to the same rule; for example, that in a class which,
as a whole, is so uniform as that of lizards, so important a part
as the bladder is present in many species, while it is wanting
in others; similarly that dolphins and certain cetacea related to
them are entirely without olfactory nerves, while the rest of the
cetacea and even fishes have them: there must be a reason which
determines this.
