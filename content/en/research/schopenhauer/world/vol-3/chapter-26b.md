Individual real exceptions to this universal law of design in organised nature have been discovered.

The male kangaroo has the marsupial bones which in the female carry the pouch; that male mammals have breasts; 

The Mus typhlus, a rat, has eyes, although very small ones, without any
opening for them in the outer skin, which thus covers them,
clothed with hair; and that the moles of the Apennines, and also
two fishes—Murena cœcilia and Gastrobrauchus cœcus—are in
the same case; of like kind is the Proteus anguinus. These rare
and surprising exceptions to the rule of nature, which is otherwise
so rigid, these contradictions with itself into which it falls, we
must explain from the inner connection which the different kinds
of phenomena have with each other, by virtue of the unity of
that which manifests itself in them, and in consequence of which
nature must hint at some thing in one, simply because another of
the same type actually has it. 

Accordingly the male animal has
a rudimentary form of an organ which is actually present in the
female. As now here the difference of the sex cannot abolish the
type of the species, so also the type of a whole order—for exam- [082]
ple, of the batrachia—asserts itself even where in one particular
species (pipa) one of its determinations is superfluous. Still less
can nature allow a determination (eyes) which belongs to the
type of a whole division (Vertebrata) to vanish entirely without
a trace, even if it is wanting in some particular species (Mus
typhlus) as superfluous; but here also it must at least indicate in
a rudimentary manner what it carries out in all the others.

Even from this point of view it is to some extent possible to
see upon what depends that homology in the skeleton primarily
of mammals, and in a wider sense of all vertebrates, which has been so fully explained, especially by Richard Owen in his
“Ostéologie comparée,” and on account of which, for example,
all mammals have seven cervical vertebræ, every bone of the
human hand and arm finds its analogue in the fin of the whale,
the skull of the bird in the egg has exactly as many bones as
that of the human fœtus, &c. All this points to a principle which
is independent of teleology, but which is yet the foundation
upon which teleology builds, or the already given material for its
works, and just that which Geoffroy St. Hilaire has explained as
the “anatomical element.” It is the unité de plan, the fundamental
type of the higher animal world, as it were the arbitrarily chosen
key upon which nature here plays.

Aristotle has already correctly defined the difference between
the efficient cause (causa efficiens) and the final cause (causa
finalis) in these words: “î≈ø ƒ¡ø¿øπ ƒ∑¬ ±πƒπ±¬, ƒø øQ Ωμ∫±
∫±π ƒø μæ ±Ω±≥∫∑¬, ∫±π ¥μπ ªμ≥øΩƒ±¬ ƒ≈≥«±ΩμπΩ º±ªπ√ƒ± ºμΩ
±º∆øπΩ.” (Duo sunt causæ modi: alter cujus gratia, et alter e
necessitate; ac potissimum utrumque eruere oportet.) De part.
anim., i. 1. The efficient cause is that whereby something is, the
final cause that on account of which it is; the phenomenon to be
explained has, in time, the former behind it, and the latter before
it. Only in the case of the voluntary actions of animal beings do[083]
the two directly unite, for here the final cause, the end, appears
as the motive; a motive, however, is always the true and proper
cause of the action, is wholly and solely its efficient cause, the
change preceding it which calls it forth, by virtue of which it
necessarily appears, and without which it could not happen; as I
have shown in my prize essay upon freedom. For whatever of a
physiological nature one might wish to insert between the act of
will and the corporeal movement, the will always remains here
confessedly that which moves, and what moves it is the motive
coming from without, thus the causa finalis; which consequently
appears here as causa efficiens. Besides, we know from what has
gone before that the bodily movement is one with the act of will, for it is merely its phenomenal appearance in cerebral perception.

This union of the causa finalis with the efficient cause in the one
phenomenon intimately known to us, which accordingly remains
throughout our typical phenomenon, is certainly to be firmly
retained; for it leads precisely to the conclusion that at least in
organised nature, the knowledge of which has throughout final
causes for its clue, a will is the forming power. In fact, we
cannot otherwise distinctly think a final cause except as an end
in view, i.e., a motive. Indeed, if we carefully consider the final
causes in nature in order to express their transcendent nature, we
must not shrink from a contradiction, and boldly say: the final
cause is a motive which acts upon a being, by which it is not
known. For certainly the termite nests are the motive which has
produced the toothless muzzle of the ant-bear, and also its long
extensile, glutinous tongue: the hard egg-shell which holds the
chicken imprisoned is certainly the motive for the horny point
with which its beak is provided in order to break through that
shell, after which it throws it off as of no further use. And
in the same way the laws of the reflection and refraction of
light are the motive for the wonderfully ingenious and complex
optical instrument, the human eye, which has the transparency
of its cornea, the different density of its three humours, the [084]
form of its lens, the blackness of its choroid, the sensitiveness
of its retina, the contracting power of its pupil, and its muscular
system, accurately calculated according to those laws. But those
motives acted before they were apprehended; it is not otherwise,
however contradictory it may sound. For here is the transition of
the physical into the metaphysical. But the latter we have already
recognised in the will; therefore we must see that the will which
extends an elephant's trunk towards an object is the same will
which has also called it forth and formed it, anticipating objects.
It is in conformity with this that in the investigation of organ-
ised nature we are entirely referred to final causes, everywhere
seek for these and explain everything from them. 

The efficient causes, on the contrary, here assume only a quite subordinate po-
sition as the mere tools of the final causes, and, just as in the case
of the voluntary movement of the limbs, which is confessedly ef-
fected by external motives, they are rather assumed than pointed
out. In explaining the physiological functions we certainly look
about for the efficient causes, though for the most part in vain;
but in explaining the origin of the parts we again look for them
no more, but are satisfied with the final causes alone. At the most
we have here some such general principle as that the larger the
part is to be the stronger must be the artery that conducts blood
to it; but of the actually efficient causes which bring about, for
example, the eye, the ear, the brain, we know absolutely nothing.
Indeed, even in explaining the mere functions the final cause
is far more important and more to the point than the efficient;
therefore, if the former alone is known we are instructed and
satisfied with regard to the principal matter, while, on the other
hand, the efficient cause alone helps us little. For example, if we
really knew the efficient cause of the circulation of the blood, as
we do not, but still seek it, this would help us little unless we knew the final cause, that the blood must go into the lungs for the purpose of oxidation, and again flow back for the purpose
of nourishing; but by the knowledge of this, even without the
knowledge of the efficient cause, we have gained much light.

Moreover, I am of opinion, as was said above, that the circulation
of the blood has no properly efficient cause, but that the will
is here as immediately active as in muscular movement where
motives determine it by means of nerve conduction, so that here
also the movement is called forth directly by the final cause; thus
by the need of oxidation in the lungs, which here to a certain
extent acts as a motive upon the blood, yet so that the mediation
of knowledge is in this case wanting, because everything takes
place in the interior of the organism. The so-called metamorphosis of plants, a thought lightly thrown out by Kaspar Wolf,
which, under this hyperbolic title, Goethe pompously and with solemn delivery expounds as his own production, belongs to the
class of explanations of organic nature from the efficient cause;
although ultimately he only says that nature does not in the case
of every production begin from the beginning and create out of
nothing, but as it were, writing on in the same style, adds on to
what already exists, makes use of the earlier forms, developed,
and raised to higher power, to carry its work further: just as it has
done in the ascending series of animals entirely in accordance
with the law: Natura non facit saltus, et quod commodissimum
in omnibus suis operationibus sequitur (Arist. de incessu ani-
malium, c. 2 et 8). Indeed, to explain the blossom by pointing
out in all its parts the form of the leaf seems to me almost the
same as explaining the structure of a house by showing that all
its parts, storeys, balconies, and garrets, are only composed of
bricks and mere repetitions of the original unity of the brick. And
not much better, though much more problematical, seems to me
the explanation of the skull from vertebræ, although even here
also it is a matter of course that the covering or case of the brain
will not be absolutely different and entirely disparate from that [086]
of the spinal cord, of which it is the continuation and terminal
knob, but will rather be a carrying out of the same kind of thing.
This whole method of consideration belongs to the Homology
of Richard Owen referred to above. On the other hand, it seems
to me that the following explanation of the nature of the flower
from its final cause, suggested by an Italian whose name has
escaped me, is a far more satisfactory account to give. The end
of the corolla is—(1.) Protection of the pistil and the stamina;
(2.) by means of it the purified saps are prepared, which are
concentrated in the pollen and germs; (3.) from the glands of its
base the essential oil distils which, for the most part as a fragrant
vapour, surrounding the anthers and pistil, protects them to a
certain extent from the influence of the damp air. It is also one of
the advantages of final causes that every efficient cause always
ultimately rests upon something that cannot be fathomed, a force of nature, i.e., a qualitas occulta, and, therefore, it can only give a relative explanation; while the final cause within its sphere
affords a sufficient and perfect explanation. It is true we are only
perfectly content when we know both the efficient cause, also
called by Aristotle ! ±πƒπ± μæ ±Ω±≥∫∑¬, and the final cause, !
«±¡πΩ ƒø≈ ≤μªƒπøΩø¬, at once and yet separately, as their concur-
rence, their wonderful working together, then surprises us, and on
account of it the best appears as the absolutely necessary, and the
necessary again as if it were merely the best and not necessary;
for then arises in us the dim perception that both causes, however
different may be their origin, are yet connected in the root, in
the nature of the thing in itself. But such a twofold knowledge
is seldom attainable; in organised nature, because the efficient
cause is seldom known to us; in unorganised nature, because the
final cause remains problematical. However, I will illustrate this
by a couple of examples as good as I find within the range of
my physiological knowledge, for which physiologists may be[087]
able to substitute clearer and more striking ones. The louse of
the negro is black. Final cause: its own safety. Efficient cause:
because its nourishment is the black rete Malpighi of the negro.
The multifarious, brilliant, and gay colouring of the plumage of
tropical birds is explained, although only very generally, from
the strong effect of the light in the tropics, as its efficient cause.
As the final cause I would assign that those brilliant feathers are
the gorgeous uniform in which the individuals of the innumerable
species there, often belonging to the same genus, may recognise
each other; so that each male may find his female. The same
holds good of butterflies of different zones and latitudes. It has
been observed that consumptive women, in the last stage of their
illness, readily become pregnant, that the disease stops during
pregnancy, but after delivery appears again worse than before,
and now generally results in death: similarly that consumptive
men generally beget another child in the last days of their life.
