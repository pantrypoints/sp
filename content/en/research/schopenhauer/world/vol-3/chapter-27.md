<!-- It is as if nature had wished, in the mechanical tendencies of animals, to give the investigator an illustrative commentary upon her works, according to final causes and the admirable design of her organised productions which is thereby ntroduced.  -->

The mechanical tendencies of animals show most clearly that creatures can work with the greatest decision and definiteness towards an end which they do not know or have no idea of. 

Examples are in:
- the bird's nest
- the spider's web
- the ant-lion's pitfall
- the ingenious bee-hive
- the marvellous termite dwelling

Such animals carry them out for the first time without knowing the form of the perfected work.

Nature organises in that way.

That is why in the preceding chapter I gave the paradoxical explanation of the final cause -- it is a motive which acts without being known. 

And as in working from mechanical tendency that which is active is evidently and confessedly the will, so is it also really the will which is active in the working of organising nature.

One might say, the will of animal creatures is set in motion
in two different ways: either by motivation or by instinct; thus
from without, or from within; by an external occasion, or by an
internal tendency; the former is explicable because it lies before
us without, the latter is inexplicable because it is merely internal.
But, more closely considered, the contrast between the two is[097]
not so sharp, indeed ultimately it runs back into a difference of
degree. The motive also only acts under the assumption of an
inner tendency, i.e., a definite quality of will which is called
its character. The motive in each case only gives to this a
definite direction—individualises it for the concrete case. So
also instinct, although a definite tendency of the will, does not act entirely, like a spring, from within; but it also waits for some external circumstance necessarily demanded for its action,
which at least determines the time of its manifestation; such is,
for the migrating bird, the season of the year; for the bird that
builds its nest, the fact of pregnancy and the presence of the
material for the nest; for the bee it is, for the beginning of the
structure, the basket or the hollow tree, and for the following
work many individually appearing circumstances; for the spider,
it is a well-adapted corner; for the caterpillar, the suitable leaf;
for egg-laying insects, the for the most part very specially deter-
mined and often rare place, where the hatched larvæ will at once
find their nourishment, and so on. It follows from this that in
works of mechanical tendency it is primarily the instinct of these
animals that is active, yet subordinated also to their intellect. The
instinct gives the universal, the rule; the intellect the particular,
the application, in that it directs the detail of the execution, in
which therefore the work of these animals clearly adapts itself
to the circumstances of the existing case. According to all this,
the difference between instinct and mere character is to be fixed
thus: Instinct is a character which is only set in motion by a
quite specially determined motive, and on this account the action
that proceeds from it is always exactly of the same kind; while
the character which is possessed by every species of animal and
every individual man is certainly a permanent and unalterable
quality of will, which can yet be set in motion by very different
motives, and adapts itself to these; and on account of this the [098]
action proceeding from it may, according to its material quality,
be very different, but yet will always bear the stamp of the same
character, and will therefore express and reveal this; so that
for the knowledge of this character the material quality of the
action in which it appears is essentially a matter of indifference.
Accordingly we might explain instinct as a character which is
beyond all measure one-sided and strictly determined. It follows
from this exposition that being determined by mere motivation
98 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
presupposes a certain width of the sphere of knowledge, and
consequently a more fully developed intellect: therefore it is
peculiar to the higher animals, quite pre-eminently, however, to
man; while being determined by instinct only demands as much
intellect as is necessary to apprehend the one quite specially
determined motive, which alone and exclusively becomes the
occasion for the manifestation of the instinct. Therefore it is
found in the case of an exceedingly limited sphere of knowledge,
and consequently, as a rule, and in the highest degree, only in an-
imals of the lower classes, especially insects. Since, accordingly,
the actions of these animals only require an exceedingly simple
and small motivation from without, the medium of this, thus the
intellect or the brain, is very slightly developed in them, and their
outward actions are for the most part under the same guidance
as the inner, follow upon mere stimuli, physiological functions,
thus the ganglion system. This is, then, in their case excessively
developed; their principal nerve-stem runs under the belly in
the form of two cords, which at every limb of the body form
a ganglion little inferior to the brain in size, and, according to
Cuvier, this nerve-stem is an analogue not so much of the spinal
cord as of the great sympathetic nerve. According to all this,
instinct and action through mere motivation, stand in a certain
antagonism, in consequence of which the former has its maxi-
mum in insects, and the latter in man, and the actuation of other
animals lies between the two in manifold gradations according[099]
as in each the cerebral or the ganglion system is preponderatingly
developed. Just because the instinctive action and the ingenious
contrivances of insects are principally directed from the ganglion
system, if we regard them as proceeding from the brain alone,
and wish to explain them accordingly, we fall into absurdities,
because we then apply a false key. The same circumstance,
however, imparts to their action a remarkable likeness to that of
somnambulists, which indeed is also explained as arising from
the fact that, instead of the brain, the sympathetic nerve has undertaken the conduct of the outward actions also; insects are accordingly, to a certain extent, natural somnambulists. Things
which we cannot get at directly we must make comprehensible
to ourselves by means of an analogy. What has just been referred
to will accomplish this in a high degree when assisted by the fact
that in Kieser's “Tellurismus” (vol. ii. p. 250) a case is mentioned
“in which the command of the mesmerist to the somnambulist
to perform a definite action in a waking state was carried out by
him when he awoke, without remembering the command.” Thus
it was as if he must perform that action without rightly knowing
why. Certainly this has the greatest resemblance to what goes
on in the case of mechanical instincts in insects. The young
spider feels that it must spin its web, although it neither knows
nor understands the aim of it. We are also reminded here of the
dæmon of Socrates, on account of which he had the feeling that
he must leave undone some action expected of him, or lying near
him, without knowing why—for his prophetic dream about it
was forgotten. We have in our own day quite well-authenticated
cases analogous to this; therefore I only briefly call these to mind.
One had taken his passage on a ship, but when it was about to sail
he positively would not go on board without being conscious of
a reason;—the ship went down. Another goes with companions
to a powder magazine; when he has arrived in its vicinity he [100]
absolutely will not go any further, but turns hastily back, seized
with anxiety he knows not why;—the magazine blows up. A third
upon the ocean feels moved one night, without any reason, not
to undress, but lays himself on the bed in his clothes and boots,
and even with his spectacles on;—in the night the ship goes on
fire, and he is among the few who save themselves in the boat.
All this depends upon the dull after-effect of forgotten fatidical
dreams, and gives us the key to an analogous understanding of
instinct and mechanical tendencies.
On the other hand, as has been said, the mechanical tendencies
of insects reflect much light upon the working of the unconscious
100 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
will in the inner functions of the organism and in its construction.
For without any difficulty we can see in the ant-hill or the beehive
the picture of an organism explained and brought to the light
of knowledge. In this sense Burdach says (Physiologie, vol. ii.
p. 22): “The formation and depositing of the eggs is the part
of the queen-bee, and the care for the cultivation of them falls
to the workers; thus in the former the ovary, and in the latter
the uterus, is individualised.” In the insect society, as in the
animal organism, the vita propria of each part is subordinated to
the life of the whole, and the care for the whole precedes that
for particular existence; indeed the latter is only conditionally
willed, the former unconditionally; therefore the individuals are
even sacrificed occasionally for the whole, as we allow a limb to
be taken off in order to save the whole body. Thus, for example,
if the path is closed by water against the march of the ants,
those in front boldly throw themselves in until their corpses are
heaped up into a dam for those that follow. When the drones
have become useless they are stung to death. Two queens in the
hive are surrounded, and must fight with each other till one of
them loses its life. The ant-mother bites its own wings off after
it has been impregnated, for they would only be a hindrance to[101]
it in the work that is before it of tending the new family it is
about to found under the earth (Kirby and Spence, vol. i.) As
the liver will do nothing more than secrete gall for the service of
the digestion, nay, will only itself exist for this end—and so with
every other part—the working bees also will do nothing more
than collect honey, secrete wax, and make cells for the brood of
the queen; the drones nothing more than impregnate; the queen
nothing but deposit eggs; thus all the parts work only for the
maintenance of the whole which alone is the unconditional end,
just like the parts of the organism. The difference is merely that
in the organism the will acts perfectly blindly in its primary con-
dition; in the insect society, on the other hand, the thing goes on
already in the light of knowledge, to which, however, a decided co-operation and individual choice is only left in the accidents of detail, where it gives assistance and adopts what has to be carried
out to the circumstances. But the insects will the end as a whole
without knowing it; just like organised nature working according
to final causes; even the choice of the means is not as a whole
left to their knowledge, but only the more detailed disposition
of them. Just on this account, however, their action is by no
means automatic, which becomes most distinctly visible if one
opposes obstacles to their action. For example, the caterpillar
spins itself in leaves without knowing the end; but if we destroy
the web it skilfully repairs it. Bees adapt their hive at the first to
the existing circumstances, and subsequent misfortunes, such as
intentional destruction, they meet in the way most suitable to the
special case (Kirby and Spence, Introduc. to Entomol.; Huber,
Des abeilles). Such things excite our astonishment, because the
apprehension of the circumstances and the adaptation to these is
clearly a matter of knowledge; while we believe them capable
once for all of the most ingenious preparation for the coming
race and the distant future, well knowing that in this they are not
guided by knowledge, for a forethought of that kind proceeding [102]
from knowledge demands an activity of the brain rising to the
level of reason. On the other hand, the intellect even of the
lower animals is sufficient for the modifying and arranging of
the particular case according to the existing or appearing cir-
cumstances; because, guided by instinct, it has only to fill up
the gaps which this leaves. Thus we see ants carry off their
larvæ whenever the place is too damp, and bring them back
again when it becomes dry. They do not know the aim of this,
thus are not guided in it by knowledge; but the choice of the
time at which the place is no longer suitable for the larvæ, and
also of the place to which they now bring them, is left to their
knowledge. I wish here also to mention a fact which some one
related to me verbally from his own experience, though I have
since found that Burdach quotes it from Gleditsch. The latter,
102 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
in order to test the burying-beetle (Necrophorus vespillo), had
tied a dead frog lying upon the ground to a string, the upper end
of which was fastened to a stick stuck obliquely in the ground.
Now after several burying-beetles had, according to their custom,
undermined the frog, it could not, as they expected, sink into
the ground; after much perplexed running hither and thither they
undermined the stick also. To this assistance rendered to instinct,
and that repairing of the works of mechanical tendency, we find
in the organism the healing power of nature analogous, which
not only heals wounds, replacing even bone and nerve substance,
but, if through the injury of a vein or nerve branch a connection
is interrupted, opens a new connection by means of enlargement
of other veins or nerves, nay, perhaps even by producing new
branches; which further makes some other part or function take
the place of a diseased part or function; in the case of the loss
of an eye sharpens the other, or in the case of the loss of one of
the senses sharpens all the rest; which even sometimes closes an
intestinal wound, in itself fatal, by the adhesion of the mesentery
or the peritoneum; in short, seeks to meet every injury and every[103]
disturbance in the most ingenious manner. If, on the other hand,
the injury is quite incurable, it hastens to expedite death, and
indeed the more so the higher is the species of the organism,
thus the greater its sensibility. Even this has its analogue in the
instinct of insects. The wasps, for instance, who through the
whole summer have with great care and labour fed their larvæ
on the produce of their plundering, but now, in October, see the
last generation of them facing starvation, sting them to death
(Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 374). Nay, still more curious and
special analogies may be found; for example, this: if the female
humble-bee (Apis terrestris, bombylius) lays eggs, the working
humble-bees are seized with a desire to devour them, which
lasts from six to eight hours and is satisfied unless the mother
keeps them off and carefully guards the eggs. But after this
time the working humble-bees show absolutely no inclination to eat the eggs even when offered to them; on the contrary, they now become the zealous tenders and nourishers of the larvæ now
being hatched out. This may without violence be taken as an
analogue of children's complaints, especially teething, in which
it is just the future nourishers of the organism making an attack
upon it which so often costs it its life. The consideration of all
these analogies between organised life and the instinct, together
with the mechanical tendencies of the lower animals, serves ever
more to confirm the conviction that the will is the basis of the
one as of the other, for it shows here also the subordinate rôle of
knowledge in the action of the will, sometimes more, sometimes
less, confined, and sometimes wanting altogether.


But in yet another respect instincts and the animal organisa-
tion reciprocally illustrate each other: through the anticipation
of the future which appears in both. By means of instincts and
mechanical tendencies animals care for the satisfaction of wants
which they do not yet feel, nay, not only for their own wants,
but even for those of the future brood. Thus they work for [104]
an end which is as yet unknown to them. This goes so far, as
I have illustrated by the example of the Bombex in “The Will
in Nature” (second edit. p. 45, third edit. p. 47), that they
pursue and kill in advance the enemies of their future eggs. In the
same way we see the future wants of an animal, its prospective
ends, anticipated in its whole corporisation by the organised
implements for their attainment and satisfaction; from which,
then, proceeds that perfect adaptation of the structure of every
animal to its manner of life, that equipment of it with the needful
weapons to attack its prey and to ward off its enemies, and that
calculation of its whole form with reference to the element and
the surroundings in which it has to appear as a pursuer, which I
have fully described in my work on the will in nature under the
rubric “Comparative Anatomy.” All these anticipations, both in
the instinct and in the organisation of animals, we might bring
under the conception of a knowledge a priori, if knowledge lay at their foundation at all. But this is, as we have shown, not the case. Their source lies deeper than the sphere of knowledge, in
the will as the thing in itself, which as such remains free even
from the forms of knowledge; therefore with reference to it time
has no significance, consequently the future lies as near it as the
present.
