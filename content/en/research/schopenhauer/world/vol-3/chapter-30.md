<!-- 10 This chapter is connected with §§ 33-34 of the first volume. -->

The comprehension of an Idea, the entrance of it into our consciousness, is only possible by means of a change in us, which
might also be regarded as an act of self-denial; for it consists in
this, that knowledge turns away altogether from our own will, thus now leaves out of sight entirely the valuable pledge intrusted to it, and considers things as if they could never concern the will
at all. 

For thus alone does knowledge become a pure mirror of
the objective nature of things. Knowledge conditioned in this
way must lie at the foundation of every genuine work of art as its
origin. The change in the subject which is required for this cannot
proceed from the will, just because it consists in the elimination
of all volition; thus it can be no act of the will, i.e., it cannot lie
in our choice. On the contrary, it springs only from a temporary
preponderance of the intellect over the will, or, physiologically
considered, from a strong excitement of the perceptive faculty of
the brain, without any excitement of the desires or emotions. To
explain this somewhat more accurately I remind the reader that
our consciousness has two sides; partly, it is a consciousness of
our own selves, which is the will; partly a consciousness of other
things, and as such primarily, knowledge, through perception,
of the external world, the apprehension of objects. Now the
more one side of the whole consciousness comes to the front, the
more the other side withdraws. Accordingly, the consciousness
of other things, thus knowledge of perception, becomes the more
perfect, i.e., the more objective, the less we are conscious of [127]
ourselves at the time. Here exists an actual antagonism. 

The
more we are conscious of the object, the less we are conscious of
the subject; the more, on the other hand, the latter occupies our
consciousness, the weaker and more imperfect is our perception of the external world. The state which is required for pure
objectivity of perception has partly permanent conditions in the
perfection of the brain and the general physiological qualities
favourable to its activity, partly temporary conditions, inasmuch
as such a state is favoured by all that increases the attention and
heightens the susceptibility of the cerebral nervous system, yet
without exciting any passion. One must not think here of spiritu-
ous drinks or opium; what is rather required is a night of quiet
sleep, a cold bath, and all that procures for the brain activity an
unforced predominance by quieting the circulation and calming
the passions. It is especially these natural means of furthering
the cerebral nervous activity which bring it about, certainly so
much the better the more developed and energetic in general
the brain is, that the object separates itself ever more from the
subject, and finally introduces the state of pure objectivity of per-
ception, which of itself eliminates the will from consciousness,
and in which all things stand before us with increased clearness
and distinctness, so that we are conscious almost only of them
and scarcely at all of ourselves; thus our whole consciousness
is almost nothing more than the medium through which the
perceived object appears in the world as an idea. Thus it is
necessary for pure, will-less knowledge that the consciousness of
ourselves should vanish, since the consciousness of other things
is raised to such a pitch. For we only apprehend the world in
a purely objective manner when we no longer know that we
belong to it; and all things appear the more beautiful the more
we are conscious merely of them and the less we are conscious
of ourselves. Since now all suffering proceeds from the will,[128]
which constitutes the real self, with the withdrawal of this side
of consciousness all possibility of suffering is also abolished;
therefore the condition of the pure objectivity of perception is
one which throughout gives pleasure; and hence I have shown
that in it lies one of the two constituent elements of æsthetic satisfaction. 

As soon, on the other hand, as the consciousness of our own self, thus subjectivity, i.e., the will, again obtains the upper
hand, a proportional degree of discomfort or unrest also enters;
of discomfort, because our corporealness (the organism which
in itself is the will) is again felt; of unrest, because the will, on
the path of thought, again fills the consciousness through wishes,
emotions, passions, and cares. For the will, as the principle of
subjectivity, is everywhere the opposite, nay, the antagonist of
knowledge. The greatest concentration of subjectivity consists
in the act of will proper, in which therefore we have the most
distinct consciousness of our own self. All other excitements of
the will are only preparations for this; the act of will itself is for
subjectivity what for the electric apparatus is the passing of the
spark. Every bodily sensation is in itself an excitement of the
will, and indeed oftener of the noluntas than of the voluntas. The
excitement of the will on the path of thought is that which occurs
by means of motives; thus here the subjectivity is awakened and
set in play by the objectivity itself. This takes place whenever any
object is apprehended no longer in a purely objective manner,
thus without participation in it, but, directly or indirectly, excites
desire or aversion, even if it is only by means of a recollection,
for then it acts as a motive in the widest sense of the word.
I remark here that abstract thinking and reading, which are
connected with words, belong indeed in the wider sense to the
consciousness of other things, thus to the objective employment
of the mind; yet only indirectly, by means of conceptions. But
the latter are the artificial product of the reason, and are therefore
already a work of intention. Moreover, the will is the ruler of [129]
all abstract exercise of the mind, for, according to its aims, it
imparts the direction, and also fixes the attention; therefore such
mental activity is always accompanied by some effort; and this
presupposes the activity of the will. Thus complete objectivity
of consciousness does not exist with this kind of mental activity,
as it accompanies the æsthetic apprehension, i.e., the knowledge
of the Ideas, as a condition.
128 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
In accordance with the above, the pure objectivity of per-
ception, by virtue of which no longer the individual thing as
such, but the Idea of its species is known, is conditioned by the
fact that one is no longer conscious of oneself, but only of the
perceived objects, so that one's own consciousness only remains
as the supporter of the objective existence of these objects. What
increases the difficulty of this state, and therefore makes it more
rare, is, that in it the accident (the intellect) overcomes and annuls
the substance (the will), although only for a short time. Here
also lies the analogy and, indeed, the relationship of this with the
denial of the will expounded at the end of the following book.
Although knowledge, as was shown in the preceding book, is
sprung from the will and is rooted in the manifestation of the
will, the organism, yet it is just by the will that its purity is
disturbed, as the flame is by the fuel and its smoke. It depends
upon this that we can only apprehend the purely objective na-
ture of things, the Ideas which appear in them, when we have
ourselves no interest in them, because they stand in no relation
to our will. From this, again, it arises that the Ideas of anything
appeal to us more easily from a work of art than from reality.
For what we behold only in a picture or in poetry stands outside
all possibility of having any relation to our will; for in itself it
exists only for knowledge and appeals immediately to knowledge
alone. On the other hand, the apprehension of Ideas from reality
assumes some measure of abstraction from our own volition,[130]
arising above its interests which demands a special power of the
intellect. In a high degree, and for some duration, this belongs
only to genius, which consists indeed in this, that a greater
measure of the power of knowledge exists than is required for
the service of an individual will, and this surplus becomes free,
and now comprehends the world without reference to the will.

Thus that the work of art facilitates so greatly the apprehension
of the Ideas, in which æsthetic satisfaction consists, depends not
merely upon the fact that art, by giving prominence to what is essential and eliminating what is unessential, presents the things
more distinctly and characteristically, but just as much on the
fact that the absolute silence of the will, which is demanded for
the purely objective comprehension of the nature of the things,
is attained with the greatest certainty when the perceived ob-
ject itself lies entirely outside the province of things which are
capable of having a relation to the will, because it is nothing
real, but a mere picture. Now this holds good, not only of the
works of plastic and pictorial art, but also of poetry; the effect of
which is also conditioned by indifferent, will-less, and thereby
purely objective apprehension. It is exactly this which makes a
perceived object picturesque, an event of actual life poetical; for
it is only this that throws over the objects of the real world that
magic gleam which in the case of sensibly perceived objects is
called the picturesque, and in the case of those which are only
perceived in imagination is called the poetical. If poets sing
of the blithe morning, the beautiful evening, the still moonlight
night, and many such things, the real object of their praise is,
unknown to themselves, the pure subject of knowledge which is
called forth by those beauties of nature, and on the appearance of
which the will vanishes from consciousness, and so that peace of
heart enters which, apart from this, is unattainable in the world.
How otherwise, for example, could the verse— [131]
“Nox erat, at cœlo fulgebat luna sereno,
Inter minora sidera,”
affect us so beneficently, nay, so magically? Further, that the
stranger or the mere passing traveller feels the picturesque or
poetical effect of objects which are unable to produce this effect
upon those who live among them may be explained from the fact
that the novelty and complete strangeness of the objects of such
an indifferent, purely objective apprehension are favourable to
it. Thus, for example, the sight of an entirely strange town often
130 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
makes a specially agreeable impression upon the traveller, which
it by no means produces in the inhabitant of it; for it arises from
the fact that the former, being out of all relation to this town
and its inhabitants, perceives it purely objectively. Upon this
depends partly the pleasure of travelling. This seems also to be
the reason why it is sought to increase the effect of narrative or
dramatic works by transferring the scene to distant times or lands:
in Germany, to Italy or Spain; in Italy, to Germany, Poland, or
even Holland. If now perfectly objective, intuitive apprehension,
purified from all volition, is the condition of the enjoyment of
æsthetic objects, so much the more is it the condition of their
production. Every good picture, every genuine poem, bears the
stamp of the frame of mind described. For only what has sprung
from perception, and indeed from purely objective perception,
or is directly excited by it, contains the living germ from which
genuine and original achievements can grow up: not only in
plastic and pictorial art, but also in poetry, nay, even in philos-
ophy. The punctum saliens of every beautiful work, of every
great or profound thought, is a purely objective perception. Such
perception, however, is absolutely conditioned by the complete
silence of the will, which leaves the man simply the pure subject
of knowledge. The natural disposition for the predominance of
this state is genius.

With the disappearance of volition from consciousness, the[132]
individuality also, and with it its suffering and misery, is really
abolished. Therefore I have described the pure subject of knowl-
edge which then remains over as the eternal eye of the world,
which, although with very different degrees of clearness, looks
forth from all living creatures, untouched by their appearing and
passing away, and thus, as identical with itself, as constantly one
and the same, is the supporter of the world of permanent Ideas,
i.e., of the adequate objectivity of the will; while the individual
subject, whose knowledge is clouded by the individuality which
springs from the will, has only particular things as its object, and is transitory as these themselves. In the sense here indicated a
double existence may be attributed to every one. As will, and
therefore as individual, he is only one, and this one exclusively,
which gives him enough to do and to suffer. As the purely
objective perceiver, he is the pure subject of knowledge in whose
consciousness alone the objective world has its existence; as such
he is all things so far as he perceives them. and in him is their
existence without burden or inconvenience. It is his existence,
so far as it exists in his idea; but it is there without will. So far,
on the other hand, as it is will, it is not in him. It is well with
every one when he is in that state in which he is all things; it is ill
with him when in the state in which he is exclusively one. Every
state, every man, every scene of life, requires only to be purely
objectively apprehended and be made the subject of a sketch,
whether with pencil or with words, in order to appear interesting,
charming, and enviable; but if one is in it, if one is it oneself,
then (it is often a case of) may the devil endure it. Therefore
Goethe says—
“What in life doth only grieve us,
That in art we gladly see.”
There was a period in the years of my youth when I was always
trying to see myself and my action from without, and picture it
to myself; probably in order to make it more enjoyable to me. [133]
As I have never spoken before on the subject I have just been
considering, I wish to add a psychological illustration of it.
In the immediate perception of the world and of life we con-
sider things, as a rule, merely in their relations, consequently
according to their relative and not their absolute nature and ex-
istence. For example, we will regard houses, ships, machines,
and the like with the thought of their end and their adaptation
to it; men, with the thought of their relation to us, if they have
any such; and then with that of their relations to each other,
132 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
whether in their present action or with regard to their position
and business, judging perhaps their fitness for it, &c. Such a
consideration of the relations we can follow more or less far
to the most distant links of their chain: the consideration will
thereby gain in accuracy and extent, but in its quality and nature
it remains the same. It is the consideration of things in their
relations, nay, by means of these, thus according to the principle
of sufficient reason. Every one, for the most part and as a rule,
is given up to this method of consideration; indeed I believe
that most men are capable of no other. But if, as an exception,
it happens that we experience a momentary heightening of the
intensity of our intuitive intelligence, we at once see things with
entirely different eyes, in that we now apprehend them no longer
according to their relations, but according to that which they are
in and for themselves, and suddenly perceive their absolute exis-
tence apart from their relative existence. At once every individual
represents its species; and accordingly we now apprehend the
universal of every being. Now what we thus know are the Ideas
of things; but out of these there now speaks a higher wisdom
than that which knows of mere relations. And we also have
then passed out of the relations, and have thus become the pure
subject of knowledge. But what now exceptionally brings about
this state must be internal physiological processes, which purify
the activity of the brain, and heighten it to such a degree that[134]
a sudden spring-tide of activity like this ensues. The external
conditions of this are that we remain completely strange to the
scene to be considered, and separated from it, and are absolutely
not actively involved in it.

In order to see that a purely objective, and therefore correct,
comprehension of things is only possible when we consider them
without any personal participation in them, thus when the will is
perfectly silent, let one call to mind how much every emotion or
passion disturbs and falsifies our knowledge, indeed how every
inclination and aversion alters, colours, and distorts not only the judgment, but even the original perception of things. 

Let one remember how when we are gladdened by some fortunate
occurrence the whole world at once assumes a bright colour and
a smiling aspect, and, on the contrary, looks gloomy and sad
when we are pressed with cares; also, how even a lifeless thing,
if it is to be made use of in doing something which we abhor,
seems to have a hideous physiognomy; for example, the scaffold,
the fortress, to which we have been brought, the surgeon's cases
of instruments; the travelling carriage of our loved one, &c.,
nay, numbers, letters, seals, may seem to grin upon us horribly
and affect us as fearful monstrosities. On the other hand, the
tools for the accomplishment of our wishes at once appear to
us agreeable and pleasing; for example, the hump-backed old
woman with the love-letter, the Jew with the louis d'ors, the
rope-ladder to escape by, &c. As now here the falsification of
the idea through the will in the case of special abhorrence or
love is unmistakable, so is it present in a less degree in every
object which has any even distant relation to our will, that is, to
our desire or aversion. Only when the will with its interests has
left consciousness, and the intellect freely follows its own laws,
and as pure subject mirrors the objective world, yet in doing
so, although spurred on by no volition, is of its own inclination
in the highest state of tension and activity, do the colours and [135]
forms of things appear in their true and full significance. Thus
it is from such comprehension alone that genuine works of art
can proceed whose permanent worth and ever renewed approval
arises simply from the fact that they express the purely objective
element, which lies at the foundation of and shines through the
different subjective, and therefore distorted, perceptions, as that
which is common to them all and alone stands fast; as it were the
common theme of all those subjective variations. For certainly
the nature which is displayed before our eyes exhibits itself very
differently in different minds; and as each one sees it so alone
can he repeat it, whether with the pencil or the chisel, or with
134 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
words and gestures on the stage. Objectivity alone makes one
capable of being an artist; but objectivity is only possible in this
way, that the intellect, separated from its root the will, moves
freely, and yet acts with the highest degree of energy.
To the youth whose perceptive intellect still acts with fresh
energy nature often exhibits itself with complete objectivity, and
therefore with perfect beauty. But the pleasure of such a glance is
sometimes disturbed by the saddening reflection that the objects
present which exhibit themselves in such beauty do not stand in
a personal relation to this will, by virtue of which they could
interest and delight him; he expects his life in the form of an inter-
esting romance. “Behind that jutting cliff the well-mounted band
of friends should await me,—beside that waterfall my love should
rest; this beautifully lighted building should be her dwelling, and
that vine-clad window hers;—but this beautiful world is for me
a desert!” and so on. Such melancholy youthful reveries really
demand something exactly contradictory to themselves; for the
beauty with which those objects present themselves depends just
upon the pure objectivity, i.e., disinterestedness of their percep-
tion, and would therefore at once be abolished by the relation
to his own will which the youth painfully misses, and thus[136]
the whole charm which now affords him pleasure, even though
alloyed with a certain admixture of pain, would cease to exist.
The same holds good, moreover, of every age and every relation;
the beauty of the objects of a landscape which now delights us
would vanish if we stood in personal relations to them, of which
we remained always conscious. Everything is beautiful only so
long as it does not concern us. (We are not speaking here of
sensual passion, but of æsthetic pleasure.) Life is never beautiful,
but only the pictures of life are so in the transfiguring mirror of
art or poetry; especially in youth, when we do not yet know it.
Many a youth would receive great peace of mind if one could
assist him to this knowledge.
Why has the sight of the full moon such a beneficent, quieting, and exalting effect? Because the moon is an object of perception, but never of desire:

“The stars we yearn not after
Delight us with their glory.”—G.

Further, it is sublime, i.e., it induces a lofty mood in us, be-
cause, without any relation to us, it moves along for ever strange
to earthly doings, and sees all while it takes part in nothing.
Therefore, at the sight of it the will, with its constant neediness,
vanishes from consciousness, and leaves a purely knowing con-
sciousness behind. Perhaps there is also mingled here a feeling
that we share this sight with millions, whose individual differ-
ences are therein extinguished, so that in this perception they
are one, which certainly increases the impression of the sublime.
Finally, this is also furthered by the fact that the moon lights
without heating, in which certainly lies the reason why it has
been called chaste and identified with Diana. In consequence
of this whole beneficent impression upon our feeling, the moon
becomes gradually our bosom friend. The sun, again, never does
so; but is like an over-plenteous benefactor whom we can never
look in the face. [137]
The following remark may find room here as an addition to
what is said in § 38 of the first volume on the æsthetic pleasure
afforded by light, reflection, and colours. The whole immediate,
thoughtless, but also unspeakable, pleasure which is excited in us
by the impression of colours, strengthened by the gleam of met-
al, and still more by transparency, as, for example, in coloured
windows, and in a greater measure by means of the clouds and
their reflection at sunset,—ultimately depends upon the fact that
here in the easiest manner, almost by a physical necessity, our
whole interest is won for knowledge, without any excitement of
our will, so that we enter the state of pure knowing, although
for the most part this consists here in a mere sensation of the
136 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
affection of the retina, which, however, as it is in itself perfectly
free from pain or pleasure, and therefore entirely without direct
influence on the will, thus belongs to pure knowledge.
