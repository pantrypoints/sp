This chapter is connected with Chapter 36 of Volume 1.

Genius is the predominating capacity for knowledge that generates genuine:

1. art, poetry
2. philosophy

This has the Platonic Ideas for its objects.

These are not comprehended in the abstract, but only perceptibly.

The essence of genius is in the perfection and energy of the knowledge of perception.

The works of genius are those which start immediately from perception and devote themselves to perception.

Thus those of plastic and pictorial art, and then those of poetry, which gets its perceptions by the assistance
of the imagination. 

The difference between genius and mere talent makes itself noticeable even here. 

For talent is an excellence which lies rather in the greater versatility and acuteness of discursive than of intuitive knowledge. 

He who is endowed with talent thinks more quickly and more correctly than others; but the genius beholds another world from them all, although only because he has a more profound perception of the world which lies before them also, in that it presents itself in his mind more objectively, and consequently in greater purity and distinctness.

The intellect is, according to its destination, merely the medium of motives.

It originally comprehends nothing in things but their relations to the will, the direct, the indirect, and the possible. In the case of the brutes, where it is almost entirely confined to the direct relations, the matter is just on that account most apparent: what has no relation to their will does not exist for them. Therefore we sometimes see with surprise that even clever animals do not observe at all something conspicuous to them; for example, they show no surprise at obvious alterations in our person and surroundings.

In the case of normal men the indirect, and even the possible,
relations to the will are added, the sum of which make up the
total of useful knowledge; but here also knowledge remains
confined to the relations. Therefore the normal mind does not
attain to an absolutely pure, objective picture of things, because
its power of perception, whenever it is not spurred on by the will
and set in motion, at once becomes tired and inactive, because it
has not enough energy of its own elasticity and without an end
in view to apprehend the world in a purely objective manner.
Where, on the other hand, this takes place—where the brain has
such a surplus of the power of ideation that a pure, distinct,
objective image of the external world exhibits itself without any
aim; an image which is useless for the intentions of the will,
indeed, in the higher degrees, disturbing, and even injurious to
them—there, the natural disposition, at least, is already present
for that abnormity which the name genius denotes, which signi-
fies that here a genius foreign to the will, i.e., to the I proper,
as it were coming from without, seems to be active. But to
speak without a figure: genius consists in this, that the knowing
faculty has received a considerably greater development than
the service of the will, for which alone it originally appeared,
demands. Therefore, strictly speaking, physiology might to a
certain extent class such a superfluity of brain activity, and with
it of brain itself, among the monstra per excessum, which, it is[140]
well known, it co-ordinates with monstra per defectum and those
per situm mutatum. Thus genius consists in an abnormally large
measure of intellect, which can only find its use by being applied
to the universal of existence, whereby it then devotes itself to the
service of the whole human race, as the normal intellect to that
of the individual. In order to make this perfectly comprehensible
one might say: if the normal man consists of two-thirds will and one-third intellect, the genius, on the contrary, has two-thirds intellect and one-third will. This might, then, be further illustrated by a chemical simile: the base and the acid of a neutral salt are
distinguished by the fact that in each of the two the radical has
the converse relation to oxygen to that which it has in the other.
The base or the alkali is so because in it the radical predominates
with reference to oxygen, and the acid is so because in it oxygen
predominates. In the same way now the normal man and the
genius are related in respect of will and intellect. From this arises
a thorough distinction between them, which is visible even in
their whole nature and behaviour, but comes out most clearly
in their achievements. One might add the difference that while
that total opposition between the chemical materials forms the
strongest affinity and attraction between them, in the human race
the opposite is rather wont to be found.
The first manifestation which such a superfluity of the power
of knowledge calls forth shows itself for the most part in the
most original and fundamental knowledge, i.e., in knowledge of
perception, and occasions the repetition of it in an image; hence
arises the painter and the sculptor. In their case, then, the path
between the apprehension of genius and the artistic production is
the shortest; therefore the form in which genius and its activity
here exhibits itself is the simplest and its description the easiest.
Yet here also the source is shown from which all genuine pro-
ductions in every art, in poetry, and indeed in philosophy, have [141]
their origin, although in the case of these the process is not so
simple.
Let the result arrived at in the first book be here borne in mind,
that all perception is intellectual and not merely sensuous. If one
now adds the exposition given here, and, at the same time, in
justice considers that the philosophy of last century denoted the
perceptive faculty of knowledge by the name “lower powers of
the soul,” we will not think it so utterly absurd nor so deserving of
the bitter scorn with which Jean Paul quotes it in his “Vorschule
der Æsthetik,” that Adelung, who had to speak the language of his
age, placed genius in “a remarkable strength of the lower powers
140 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of the soul.” The work just referred to of this author, who is so
worthy of our admiration, has great excellences, but yet I must
remark that all through, whenever a theoretical explanation and,
in general, instruction is the end in view, a style of exposition
which is constantly indulging in displays of wit and hurrying
along in mere similes cannot be well adapted to the purpose.
It is, then, perception to which primarily the peculiar and true
nature of things, although still in a conditioned manner, discloses
and reveals itself. All conceptions and everything thought are
mere abstractions, consequently partial ideas taken from per-
ception, and have only arisen by thinking away. All profound
knowledge, even wisdom properly so called, is rooted in the
perceptive apprehension of things, as we have fully considered in
the supplements to the first book. A perceptive apprehension has
always been the generative process in which every genuine work
of art, every immortal thought, received the spark of life. All
primary thought takes place in pictures. From conceptions, on
the other hand, arise the works of mere talent, the merely rational
thoughts, imitations, and indeed all that is calculated merely with
reference to the present need and contemporary conditions.
But if now our perception were constantly bound to the[142]
real present of things, its material would be entirely under the
dominion of chance, which seldom produces things at the right
time, seldom arranges them for an end and for the most part
presents them to us in very defective examples. Therefore the
imagination is required in order to complete, arrange, give the
finishing touches to, retain, and repeat at pleasure all those sig-
nificant pictures of life, according as the aims of a profoundly
penetrating knowledge and of the significant work whereby they
are to be communicated may demand. Upon this rests the high
value of imagination, which is an indispensable tool of genius.
For only by virtue of imagination can genius ever, according to
the requirements of the connection of its painting or poetry or
thinking, call up to itself each object or event in a lively image, and thus constantly draw fresh nourishment from the primary source of all knowledge, perception. The man who is endowed
with imagination is able, as it were, to call up spirits, who at
the right time reveal to him the truths which the naked reality of
things exhibits only weakly, rarely, and then for the most part at
the wrong time. Therefore the man without imagination is related
to him, as the mussel fastened to its rock, which must wait for
what chance may bring it, is related to the freely moving or even
winged animal. For such a man knows nothing but the actual
perception of the senses: till it comes he gnaws at conceptions
and abstractions which are yet mere shells and husks, not the ker-
nel of knowledge. He will never achieve anything great, unless
it be in calculating and mathematics. The works of plastic and
pictorial art and of poetry, as also the achievements of mimicry,
may also be regarded as means by which those who have no
imagination may make up for this defect as far as possible, and
those who are gifted with it may facilitate the use of it.
Thus, although the kind of knowledge which is peculiar and
essential to genius is knowledge of perception, yet the special
object of this knowledge by no means consists of the particular [143]
things, but of the Platonic Ideas which manifest themselves in
these, as their apprehension was analysed in chapter 29. Always
to see the universal in the particular is just the fundamental char-
acteristic of genius, while the normal man knows in the particular
only the particular as such, for only as such does it belong to
the actual which alone has interests for him, i.e., relations to
his will. The degree in which every one not merely thinks, but
actually perceives, in the particular thing, only the particular, or
a more or less universal up to the most universal of the species,
is the measure of his approach to genius. And corresponding to
this, only the nature of things generally, the universal in them,
the whole, is the special object of genius. The investigation of
the particular phenomena is the field of the talents, in the real
sciences, whose special object is always only the relations of things to each other.

What was fully shown in the preceding chapter, that the apprehension of the Ideas is conditioned by the fact that the knower is the pure subject of knowledge, i.e., that the will entirely
vanishes from consciousness, must be borne in mind here. The
pleasure which we have in many of Goethe's songs which bring
the landscape before our eyes, or in Jean Paul's sketches of
nature, depends upon the fact that we thereby participate in the
objectivity of those minds, i.e., the purity with which in them
the world as idea separated from the world as will, and, as it
were, entirely emancipated itself from it. It also follows from the
fact that the kind of knowledge peculiar to genius is essentially
that which is purified from all will and its relations, that the
works of genius do not proceed from intention or choice, but it
is guided in them by a kind of instinctive necessity. What is
called the awaking of genius, the hour of initiation, the moment
of inspiration, is nothing but the attainment of freedom by the
intellect, when, delivered for a while from its service under the
will, it does not now sink into inactivity or lassitude, but is active[144]
for a short time entirely alone and spontaneously. Then it is of
the greatest purity, and becomes the clear mirror of the world;
for, completely severed from its origin, the will, it is now the
world as idea itself, concentrated in one consciousness. In such
moments, as it were, the souls of immortal works are begotten.
On the other hand, in all intentional reflection the intellect is not
free, for indeed the will guides it and prescribes it its theme.
The stamp of commonness, the expression of vulgarity, which
is impressed on the great majority of countenances consists re-
ally in this, that in them becomes visible the strict subordination
of their knowledge to their will, the firm chain which binds
these two together, and the impossibility following from this of
apprehending things otherwise than in their relation to the will
and its aims. On the other hand, the expression of genius which
constitutes the evident family likeness of all highly gifted men consists in this, that in it we distinctly read the liberation, the
manumission of the intellect from the service of the will, the pre-
dominance of knowledge over volition; and because all anxiety
proceeds from the will, and knowledge, on the contrary, is in
and for itself painless and serene, this gives to their lofty brow
and clear, perceiving glance, which are not subject to the service
of the will and its wants, that look of great, almost supernatural
serenity which at times breaks through, and consists very well
with the melancholy of their other features, especially the mouth,
and which in this relation may be aptly described by the motto
of Giordano Bruno: In tristitia hilaris, in hilaritate tristis.
The will, which is the root of the intellect, opposes itself to any
activity of the latter which is directed to anything else but its own
aims. Therefore the intellect is only capable of a purely objective
and profound comprehension of the external world when it has
freed itself at least for a while from this its root. So long as
it remains bound to the will, it is of its own means capable [145]
of no activity, but sleeps in a stupor, whenever the will (the
interests) does not awake it, and set it in motion. If, however, this
happens, it is indeed very well fitted to recognise the relations of
things according to the interest of the will, as the prudent mind
does, which, however, must always be an awakened mind, i.e.,
a mind actively aroused by volition; but just on this account it
is not capable of comprehending the purely objective nature of
things. For the willing and the aims make it so one-sided that
it sees in things only that which relates to these, and the rest
either disappears or enters consciousness in a falsified form. For
example, the traveller in anxiety and haste will see the Rhine
and its banks only as a line, and the bridges over it only as lines
cutting it. In the mind of the man who is filled with his own aims
the world appears as a beautiful landscape appears on the plan
of a battlefield. Certainly these are extremes, taken for the sake
of distinctness; but every excitement of the will, however slight,
will have as its consequence a slight but constantly proportionate
144 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
falsification of knowledge. The world can only appear in its true
colour and form, in its whole and correct significance, when the
intellect, devoid of willing, moves freely over the objects, and
without being driven on by the will is yet energetically active.
This is certainly opposed to the nature and determination of
the intellect, thus to a certain extent unnatural, and just on this
account exceedingly rare; but it is just in this that the essential
nature of genius lies, in which alone that condition takes place
in a high degree and is of some duration, while in others it only
appears approximately and exceptionally. I take it to be in the
sense expounded here that Jean Paul (Vorschule der Æsthetik, §
12) places the essence of genius in reflectiveness. The normal
man is sunk in the whirl and tumult of life, to which he belongs
through his will; his intellect is filled with the things and events
of life; but he does not know these things nor life itself in their[146]
objective significance; as the merchant on 'Change in Amster-
dam apprehends perfectly what his neighbour says, but does not
hear the hum of the whole Exchange, like the sound of the sea,
which astonishes the distant observer. From the genius, on the
contrary, whose intellect is delivered from the will, and thus
from the person, what concerns these does not conceal the world
and things themselves; but he becomes distinctly conscious of
them, he apprehends them in and for themselves in objective
perception; in this sense he is reflective.
It is reflectiveness which enables the painter to repeat the natu-
ral objects which he contemplates faithfully upon the canvas, and
the poet accurately to call up again the concrete present, by means
of abstract conceptions, by giving it utterance and so bringing
it to distinct consciousness, and also to express everything in
words which others only feel. The brute lives entirely without
reflection. It has consciousness, i.e., it knows itself and its good
and ill, also the objects which occasion these. But its knowledge
remains always subjective, never becomes objective; everything
that enters it seems a matter of course, and therefore can never become for it a theme (an object of exposition) nor a problem
(an object of meditation). Its consciousness is thus entirely im-
manent. Not certainly the same, but yet of kindred nature, is the
consciousness of the common type of man, for his apprehension
also of things and the world is predominantly subjective and
remains prevalently immanent. It apprehends the things in the
world, but not the world; its own action and suffering, but not
itself. As now in innumerable gradations the distinctness of
consciousness rises, reflectiveness appears more and more; and
thus it is brought about little by little that sometimes, though
rarely, and then again in very different degrees of distinctness,
the question passes through the mind like a flash, “What is all
this?” or again, “How is it really fashioned?” The first question, [147]
if it attains great distinctness and continued presence, will make
the philosopher, and the other, under the same conditions, the
artist or the poet. Therefore, then, the high calling of both of
these has its root in the reflectiveness which primarily springs
from the distinctness with which they are conscious of the world
and their own selves, and thereby come to reflect upon them. But
the whole process springs from the fact that the intellect through
its preponderance frees itself for a time from the will, to which it
is originally subject.

The considerations concerning genius here set forth are connected by way of supplement with the exposition contained in
chapter 21, of the ever wider separation of the will and the
intellect, which can be traced in the whole series of existences.

This reaches its highest grade in genius, where it extends to the
entire liberation of the intellect from its root the will, so that here
the intellect becomes perfectly free, whereby the world as idea
first attains to complete objectification.

A few remarks now concerning the individuality of genius.

Aristotle has already said, according to Cicero (Tusc., i. 33),
“Omnes ingeniosos melancholicos esse;” which without doubt is
connected with the passage of Aristotle's “Problemata,” xxx. 1.
146 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
Goethe also says: “My poetic rapture was very small, so long as
I only encountered good; but it burnt with a bright flame when I
fled from threatening evil. The tender poem, like the rainbow, is
only drawn on a dark ground; hence the genius of the poet loves
the element of melancholy.”
This is to be explained from the fact that since the will con-
stantly re-establishes its original sway over the intellect, the latter
more easily withdraws from this under unfavourable personal re-
lations; because it gladly turns from adverse circumstances, in
order to a certain extent to divert itself, and now directs itself
with so much the greater energy to the foreign external world,
thus more easily becomes purely objective. Favourable personal
relations act conversely. Yet as a whole and in general the[148]
melancholy which accompanies genius depends upon the fact
that the brighter the intellect which enlightens the will to live,
the more distinctly does it perceive the misery of its condition.
The melancholy disposition of highly gifted minds which has so
often been observed has its emblem in Mont Blanc, the summit
of which is for the most part lost in clouds; but when sometimes,
especially in the early morning, the veil of clouds is rent and
now the mountain looks down on Chamounix from its height
in the heavens above the clouds, then it is a sight at which the
heart of each of us swells from its profoundest depths. So also
the genius, for the most part melancholy, shows at times that
peculiar serenity already described above, which is possible only
for it, and springs from the most perfect objectivity of the mind.
It floats like a ray of light upon his lofty brow: In tristitia hilaris,
in hilaritate tristis.

All bunglers are so ultimately because their intellect, still too
firmly bound to the will, only becomes active when spurred
on by it, and therefore remains entirely in its service. They
are accordingly only capable of personal aims. In conformity
with these they produce bad pictures, insipid poems, shallow,
absurd, and very often dishonest philosophemes, when it is to their interest to recommend themselves to high authorities by a pious disingenuousness. Thus all their action and thought is
personal. Therefore they succeed at most in appropriating what is
external, accidental, and arbitrary in the genuine works of others
as mannerisms, in doing which they take the shell instead of the
kernel, and yet imagine they have attained to everything, nay,
have surpassed those works. If, however, the failure is patent,
yet many hope to attain success in the end through their good
intentions. But it is just this good will which makes success im-
possible; because this only pursues personal ends, and with these
neither art nor poetry nor philosophy can ever be taken seriously.
Therefore the saying is peculiarly applicable to such persons: [149]
“They stand in their own light.” They have no idea that it is only
the intellect delivered from the government of the will and all its
projects, and therefore freely active, that makes one capable of
genuine productions, because it alone imparts true seriousness;
and it is well for them that they have not, otherwise they would
leap into the water. The good will is in morality everything; but
in art it is nothing. In art, as the word itself indicates (Kunst),
what alone is of consequence is ability (Können). It all amounts
ultimately to this, where the true seriousness of the man lies. In
almost all it lies exclusively in their own well-being and that of
their families; therefore they are in a position to promote this
and nothing else; for no purpose, no voluntary and intentional
effort, imparts the true, profound, and proper seriousness, or
makes up for it, or more correctly, takes its place. For it always
remains where nature has placed it; and without it everything
is only half performed. Therefore, for the same reason, persons
of genius often manage so badly for their own welfare. As a
leaden weight always brings a body back to the position which
its centre of gravity thereby determined demands, so the true
seriousness of the man always draws the strength and attention of
the intellect back to that in which it lies; everything else the man
does without true seriousness. Therefore only the exceedingly
148 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
rare and abnormal men whose true seriousness does not lie in
the personal and practical, but in the objective and theoretical,
are in a position to apprehend what is essential in the things of
the world, thus the highest truths, and reproduce them in any
way. For such a seriousness of the individual, falling outside
himself in the objective, is something foreign to the nature of
man, something unnatural, or really supernatural: yet on account
of this alone is the man great; and therefore what he achieves
is then ascribed to a genius different from himself, which takes
possession of him. To such a man his painting, poetry, or[150]
thinking is an end; to others it is a means. The latter thereby
seek their own things, and, as a rule, they know how to further
them, for they flatter their contemporaries, ready to serve their
wants and humours; therefore for the most part they live in happy
circumstances; the former often in very miserable circumstances.
For he sacrifices his personal welfare to his objective end; he
cannot indeed do otherwise, because his seriousness lies there.
They act conversely; therefore they are small, but he is great.
Accordingly his work is for all time, but the recognition of it
generally only begins with posterity: they live and die with their
time. In general he only is great who in his work, whether it is
practical or theoretical, seeks not his own concerns, but pursues
an objective end alone; he is so, however, even when in the
practical sphere this end is a misunderstood one, and even if in
consequence of this it should be a crime. That he seeks not himself
and his own concerns, this makes him under all circumstances
great. Small, on the other hand, is all action which is directed to
personal ends; for whoever is thereby set in activity knows and
finds himself only in his own transient and insignificant person.


He who is great, again, finds himself in all, and therefore in the
whole: he lives not, like others, only in the microcosm, but still
more in the macrocosm. Hence the whole interests him, and he seeks to comprehend it in order to represent it, or to explain it, or to act practically upon it. For it is not strange to him; he feels that it concerns him. On account of this extension of his sphere
he is called great. Therefore that lofty predicate belongs only to
the true hero, in some sense, and to genius: it signifies that they,
contrary to human nature, have not sought their own things, have
not lived for themselves, but for all. As now clearly the great
majority must constantly be small, and can never become great,
the converse of this, that one should be great throughout, that is,
constantly and every moment, is yet not possible— [151]
“For man is made of common clay,
And custom is his nurse.”
Every great man must often be only the individual, have only
himself in view, and that means he must be small. Upon this
depends the very true remark, that no man is a hero to his valet,
and not upon the fact that the valet cannot appreciate the hero;
which Goethe, in the “Wahlverwandhschaften” (vol. ii. chap. 5),
serves up as an idea of Ottilie's.

Genius is its own reward: for the best that one is, one must
necessarily be for oneself. “Whoever is born with a talent, to a
talent, finds in this his fairest existence,” says Goethe. When we
look back at a great man of former times, we do not think, “How
happy is he to be still admired by all of us!” but, “How happy
must he have been in the immediate enjoyment of a mind at the
surviving traces of which centuries revive themselves!” Not in
the fame, but in that whereby it is attained, lies the value, and
in the production of immortal children the pleasure. Therefore
those who seek to show the vanity of posthumous fame from the
fact that he who obtains it knows nothing of it, may be compared
to the wiseacre who very learnedly tried to demonstrate to the
man who cast envious glances at a heap of oyster-shells in his
neighbour's yard the absolute uselessness of them.

According to the exposition of the nature of genius which has
been given, it is so far contrary to nature, inasmuch as it consists in this, that the intellect, whose real destination is the service of the will, emancipates itself from this service in order to be
active on its own account. Accordingly genius is an intellect
which has become untrue to its destination. Upon this depend the
disadvantages connected with it, for the consideration of which
we shall now prepare the way by comparing genius with the less
decided predominance of the intellect.

The intellect of the normal man, strictly bound to the service
of the will, and therefore really only occupied with the apprehen-[152]
sion of motives, may be regarded as a complex system of wires,
by means of which each of these puppets is set in motion in the
theatre of the world. From this arises the dry, grave seriousness
of most people, which is only surpassed by that of the brutes, who
never laugh. On the other hand, we might compare the genius,
with his unfettered intellect, to a living man playing along with
the large puppets of the famous puppet-show at Milan, who would
be the only one among them who would understand everything,
and would therefore gladly leave the stage for a while to enjoy
the play from the boxes;—that is the reflectiveness of genius.

But even the man of great understanding and reason, whom one
might almost call wise, is very different from the genius, and
in this way, that his intellect retains a practical tendency, is
concerned with the choice of the best ends and means, therefore
remains in the service of the will, and accordingly is occupied
in a manner that is thoroughly in keeping with nature. The firm,
practical seriousness of life which the Romans denoted gravitas
presupposes that the intellect does not forsake the service of the
will in order to wander away after that which does not concern
the will; therefore it does not admit of that separation of the
will and the intellect which is the condition of genius. The able,
nay, eminent man, who is fitted for great achievements in the
practical sphere, is so precisely because objects rouse his will in
a lively manner, and spur him on to the ceaseless investigation
of their relations and connections. Thus his intellect has grown up closely connected with his will. Before the man of genius, on
the contrary, there floats in his objective comprehension the phe-
nomenon of the world, as something foreign to him, an object of
contemplation, which expels his will from consciousness. Round
this point turns the distinction between the capacity for deeds and
for works. The latter demand objectivity and depth of knowledge,
which presupposes entire separation of the intellect from the [153]
will; the former, on the other hand, demands the application
of knowledge, presence of mind, and decision, which required
that the intellect should uninterruptedly attend to the service of
the will. Where the bond between the intellect and the will is
loosened, the intellect, turned away from its natural destination,
will neglect the service of the will; it will, for example, even in
the need of the moment, preserve its emancipation, and perhaps
be unable to avoid taking in the picturesque impression of the
surroundings, from which danger threatens the individual. The
intellect of the reasonable and understanding man, on the other
hand, is constantly at its post, is directed to the circumstances and
their requirements. Such a man will therefore in all cases deter-
mine and carry out what is suitable to the case, and consequently
will by no means fall into those eccentricities, personal slips,
nay, follies, to which the genius is exposed, because his intellect
does not remain exclusively the guide and guardian of his will,
but sometimes more, sometimes less, is laid claim to by the
purely objective. In the contrast of Tasso and Antonio, Goethe
has illustrated the opposition, here explained in the abstract, in
which these two entirely different kinds of capacity stand to each
other. The kinship of genius and madness, so often observed,
depends chiefly upon that separation of the intellect from the will
which is essential to genius, but is yet contrary to nature. But this
separation itself is by no means to be attributed to the fact that
genius is accompanied by less intensity of will; for it is rather
distinguished by a vehement and passionate character; but it is
to be explained from this, that the practically excellent person,
152 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the man of deeds, has merely the whole, full measure of intellect
required for an energetic will while most men lack even this; but
genius consists in a completely abnormal, actual superfluity of
intellect, such as is required for the service of no will. On this
account the men of genuine works are a thousand times rarer
than the men of deeds. It is just that abnormal superfluity of[154]
intellect by virtue of which it obtains the decided preponderance,
sets itself free from the will, and now, forgetting its origin, is
freely active from its own strength and elasticity; and from this
the creations of genius proceed.
Now further, just this, that genius in working consists of the
free intellect, i.e., of the intellect emancipated from the service of
the will, has as a consequence that its productions serve no useful
ends. The work of genius is music, or philosophy, or paintings,
or poetry; it is nothing to use. To be of no use belongs to the
character of the works of genius; it is their patent of nobility.
All other works of men are for the maintenance or easing of our
existence; only those we are speaking of are not; they alone exist
for their own sake, and are in this sense to be regarded as the
flower or the net profit of existence. Therefore our heart swells
at the enjoyment of them, for we rise out of the heavy earthly
atmosphere of want. Analogous to this, we see the beautiful,
even apart from these, rarely combined with the useful. 

Lofty
and beautiful trees bear no fruit; the fruit-trees are small, ugly
cripples. The full garden rose is not fruitful, but the small, wild,
almost scentless roses are. The most beautiful buildings are not
the useful ones; a temple is no dwelling-house. A man of high,
rare mental endowments compelled to apply himself to a merely
useful business, for which the most ordinary man would be fitted,
is like a costly vase decorated with the most beautiful painting
which is used as a kitchen pot; and to compare useful people with
men of genius is like comparing building-stone with diamonds.
Thus the merely practical man uses his intellect for that for
which nature destined it, the comprehension of the relations of things, partly to each other, partly to the will of the knowing individual. 

The genius, on the other hand, uses it, contrary to
its destination, for the comprehension of the objective nature
of things. His mind, therefore, belongs not to himself, but to
the world, to the illumination of which, in some sense, it will [155]
contribute. From this must spring manifold disadvantages to the
individual favoured with genius. For his intellect will in general
show those faults which are rarely wanting in any tool which is
used for that for which it has not been made. First of all, it will be,
as it were, the servant of two masters, for on every opportunity
it frees itself from the service to which it was destined in order
to follow its own ends, whereby it often leaves the will very
inopportunely in a fix, and thus the individual so gifted becomes
more or less useless for life, nay, in his conduct sometimes
reminds us of madness. Then, on account of its highly developed
power of knowledge, it will see in things more the universal than
the particular; while the service of the will principally requires
the knowledge of the particular. But, again, when, as opportunity
offers, that whole abnormally heightened power of knowledge
directs itself with all its energy to the circumstances and miseries
of the will, it will be apt to apprehend these too vividly, to behold
all in too glaring colours, in too bright a light, and in a fearfully
exaggerated form, whereby the individual falls into mere ex-
tremes. The following may serve to explain this more accurately.
All great theoretical achievements, in whatever sphere they may
be, are brought about in this way: Their author directs all the
forces of his mind upon one point, in which he lets them unite
and concentrate so strongly, firmly, and exclusively that now the
whole of the rest of the world vanishes for him, and his object
fills all reality. Now this great and powerful concentration which
belongs to the privileges of genius sometimes appears for it also
in the case of objects of the real world and the events of daily life,
which then, brought under such a focus, are magnified to such
a monstrous extent that they appear like the flea, which under
154 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the solar microscope assumes the stature of an elephant. Hence
it arises that highly gifted individuals sometimes are thrown by
trifles into violent emotions of the most various kinds, which are[156]
incomprehensible to others, who see them transported with grief,
joy, care, fear, anger, &c., by things which leave the every-day
man quite composed. Thus, then, the genius lacks soberness,
which simply consists in this, that one sees in things nothing
more than actually belongs to them, especially with reference
to our possible ends; therefore no sober-minded man can be a
genius. With the disadvantages which have been enumerated
there is also associated hyper-sensibility, which an abnormally
developed nervous and cerebral system brings with it, and in-
deed in union with the vehemence and passionateness of will
which is certainly characteristic of genius, and which exhibits
itself physically as energy of the pulsation of the heart. From
all this very easily arises that extravagance of disposition, that
vehemence of the emotions, that quick change of mood under
prevailing melancholy, which Goethe has presented to us in Tas-
so. What reasonableness, quiet composure, finished surveyal,
certainty and proportionateness of behaviour is shown by the
well-endowed normal man in comparison with the now dreamy
absentness, and now passionate excitement of the man of genius,
whose inward pain is the mother's lap of immortal works! 

To
all this must still be added that genius lives essentially alone. It
is too rare to find its like with ease, and too different from the
rest of men to be their companion. With them it is the will, with
him it is knowledge, that predominates; therefore their pleasures
are not his, and his are not theirs. They are merely moral beings,
and have merely personal relations; he is at the same time a
pure intellect, and as such belongs to the whole of humanity.
The course of thought of the intellect which is detached from its
mother soil, the will, and only returns to it periodically, will soon
show itself entirely different from that of the normal intellect,
still cleaving to its stem. For this reason, and also on account of the dissimilarity of the pace, the former is not adapted for thinking in common, i.e., for conversation with the others: they
will have as little pleasure in him and his oppressive superiority
as he will in them. They will therefore feel more comfortable
with their equals, and he will prefer the entertainment of his
equals, although, as a rule, this is only possible through the
works they have left behind them. Therefore Chamfort says very
rightly: “Il y a peu de vices qui empêchent un homme d'avoir
beaucoup d'amis, autant que peuvent le faire de trop grandes
qualités.” The happiest lot that can fall to the genius is release
from action, which is not his element, and leisure for production.
From all this it results that although genius may highly bless him
who is gifted with it, in the hours in which, abandoned to it,
he revels unhindered in its delight, yet it is by no means fitted
to procure for him a happy course of life; rather the contrary.
This is also confirmed by the experience recorded in biographies.
Besides this there is also an external incongruity, for the genius,
in his efforts and achievements themselves, is for the most part
in contradiction and conflict with his age. Mere men of talent
come always at the right time; for as they are roused by the spirit
of their age, and called forth by its needs, they are also capable
only of satisfying these. They therefore go hand in hand with
the advancing culture of their contemporaries or with the gradual
progress of a special science: for this they reap reward and
approval. But to the next generation their works are no longer
enjoyable; they must be replaced by others, which again are not
permanent. The genius, on the contrary, comes into his age like
a comet into the paths of the planets, to whose well-regulated
and comprehensible order its entirely eccentric course is foreign.
Accordingly he cannot go hand in hand with the existing, regular
progress of the culture of the age, but flings his works far out
on to the way in front (as the dying emperor flung his spear
among the enemy), upon which time has first to overtake them.
His relation to the culminating men of talent of his time might [158]
156 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
be expressed in the words of the Evangelist: “I ∫±π¡ø¬ A μºø¬
ø≈¿… ¿±¡μ√ƒπΩ; A ¥μ ∫±π¡ø¬ A Qºμƒμ¡ø¬ ¿±Ωƒøƒμ μ√ƒπΩ ƒøπºø¬”
(John vii. 6). The man of talent can achieve what is beyond
the power of achievement of other men, but not what is beyond
their power of apprehension: therefore he at once finds those
who prize him. But the achievement of the man of genius, on
the contrary, transcends not only the power of achievement, but
also the power of apprehension of others; therefore they do not
become directly conscious of him. The man of talent is like the
marksman who hits a mark the others cannot hit; the man of
genius is like the marksman who hits a mark they cannot even see
to; therefore they only get news of him indirectly, and thus late;
and even this they only accept upon trust and faith. Accordingly
Goethe says in one of his letters, “Imitation is inborn in us; what
to imitate is not easily recognised. Rarely is what is excellent
found; still more rarely is it prized.” And Chamfort says: “Il en
est de la valeur des hommes comme de celle des diamans, qui à
une certaine mesure de grosseur, de pureté, de perfection, ont un
prix fixe et marqué, mais qui, par-delà cette mesure, restent sans
prix, et ne trouvent point d'acheteurs.” And Bacon of Verulam
has also expressed it: “Infimarum virtutum, apud vulgus, laus est,
mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus” (De augm. sc.,
L. vi. c. 3). Indeed, one might perhaps reply, Apud vulgus! But
I must then come to his assistance with Machiavelli's assurance:
“Nel mondo non è se non volgo;”12 as also Thilo (Ueber den
Ruhm) remarks, that to the vulgar herd there generally belongs
one more than each of us believes. It is a consequence of this
late recognition of the works of the man of genius that they are
rarely enjoyed by their contemporaries, and accordingly in the
freshness of colour which synchronism and presence imparts,
but, like figs and dates, much more in a dry than in a fresh state.

If, finally, we consider genius from the somatic side, we find it conditioned by several anatomical and physiological qualities,
which individually are seldom present in perfection, and still
more seldom perfect together, but which are yet all indispensably
required; so that this explains why genius only appears as a
perfectly isolated and almost portentous exception. The funda-
mental condition is an abnormal predominance of sensibility over
irritability and reproductive power; and what makes the matter
more difficult, this must take place in a male body. (Women
may have great talent, but no genius, for they always remain
subjective.) Similarly the cerebral system must be perfectly
separated from the ganglion system by complete isolation, so
that it stands in complete opposition to the latter; and thus the
brain pursues its parasitic life on the organism in a very decided,
isolated, powerful, and independent manner. Certainly it will
thereby very easily affect the rest of the organism injuriously,
and through its heightened life and ceaseless activity wear it out
prematurely, unless it is itself possessed of energetic vital force
and a good constitution: thus the latter belong to the conditions
of genius. Indeed even a good stomach is a condition on account
of the special and close agreement of this part with the brain.
But chiefly the brain must be of unusual development and mag-
nitude, especially broad and high. On the other hand, its depth
will be inferior, and the cerebrum will abnormally preponderate
in proportion to the cerebellum. Without doubt much depends
upon the configuration of the brain as a whole and in its parts; but
our knowledge is not yet sufficient to determine this accurately,
although we easily recognise the form of skull that indicates a
noble and lofty intelligence. The texture of the mass of the brain
must be of extreme fineness and perfection, and consist of the
purest, most concentrated, tenderest, and most excitable nerve-
substance; certainly the quantitative proportion of the white to
the grey matter has a decided influence, which, however, we [160]
are also unable as yet to specify. However, the report of the
158 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
post-mortem on the body of Byron13 shows that in his case the
white matter was in unusually large proportion to the grey, and
also that his brain weighed six pounds. Cuvier's brain weighed
five pounds; the normal weight is three pounds. In contrast to
the superior size of the brain, the spinal cord and nerves must
be unusually thin. A beautifully arched, high and broad skull of
thin bone must protect the brain without in any way cramping it.
This whole quality of the brain and nervous system is the inheri-
tance from the mother, to which we shall return in the following
book. But it is quite insufficient to produce the phenomenon of
genius if the inheritance from the father is not added, a lively,
passionate temperament, which exhibits itself somatically as un-
usual energy of the heart, and consequently of the circulation of
the blood, especially towards the head. For, in the first place,
that turgescence peculiar to the brain on account of which it
presses against its walls is increased by this; therefore it forces
itself out of any opening in these which has been occasioned
by some injury; and secondly, from the requisite strength of the
heart the brain receives that internal movement different from
its constant rising and sinking at every breath, which consists
in a shaking of its whole mass at every pulsation of the four
cerebral arteries, and the energy of which must correspond to the
here increased quantity of the brain, as this movement in general
is an indispensable condition of its activity. To this, therefore,
small stature and especially a short neck is favourable, because
by the shorter path the blood reaches the brain with more energy;
and on this account great minds have seldom large bodies. Yet
that shortness of the distance is not indispensable; for example,
Goethe was of more than middle height. 

If, however, the whole
condition connected with the circulation of the blood, and therefore coming from the father is wanting, the good quality of the brain coming from the mother, will at most produce a man of talent, a fine understanding, which the phlegmatic temperament
thus introduced supports; but a phlegmatic genius is impossible.
This condition coming from the father explains many faults of
temperament described above. But, on the other hand, if this
condition exists without the former, thus with an ordinarily or
even badly constructed brain, it gives vivacity without mind,
heat without light, hot-headed persons, men of unsupportable
restlessness and petulance. That of two brothers only one has
genius, and that one generally the elder, as, for example, in
Kant's case, is primarily to be explained from the fact that the
father was at the age of strength and passion only when he was
begotten; although also the other condition originating with the
mother may be spoiled by unfavourable circumstances.
I have further to add here a special remark on the childlike
character of the genius, i.e., on a certain resemblance which
exists between genius and the age of childhood. In childhood, as
in the case of genius, the cerebral and nervous system decidedly
preponderates, for its development hurries far in advance of that
of the rest of the organism; so that already at the seventh year
the brain has attained its full extension and mass. Therefore,
Bichat says: “Dans l'enfance le système nerveux, comparé au
musculaire, est proportionellement plus considérable que dans
tous les âges suivans, tandis que par la suite, la pluspart des
autres systèmes prédominent sur celui-ci. On sait que, pour bien
voir les nerfs, on choisit toujours les enfans” (De la vie et de la
mort, art. 8, § 6). On the other hand, the development of the
genital system begins latest, and irritability, reproduction, and
genital function are in full force only at the age of manhood,
and then, as a rule, they predominate over the brain function.
Hence it is explicable that children, in general, are so sensible,
reasonable, desirous of information, and teachable, nay, on the
whole, are more disposed and fitted for all theoretical occupation [162]
than grown-up people. They have, in consequence of that course
of development, more intellect than will, i.e., than inclinations,
160 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
desire, and passion. For intellect and brain are one, and so also
is the genital system one with the most vehement of all desires:
therefore I have called the latter the focus of the will. Just because
the fearful activity of this system still slumbers, while that of the
brain has already full play, childhood is the time of innocence
and happiness, the paradise of life, the lost Eden on which we
look longingly back through the whole remaining course of our
life. But the basis of that happiness is that in childhood our
whole existence lies much more in knowing than in willing—a
condition which is also supported from without by the novelty
of all objects. Hence in the morning sunshine of life the world
lies before us so fresh, so magically gleaming, so attractive.
The small desires, the weak inclinations, and trifling cares of
childhood are only a weak counterpoise to that predominance of
intellectual activity. The innocent and clear glance of children,
at which we revive ourselves, and which sometimes in particular
cases reaches the sublime contemplative expression with which
Raphael has glorified his cherubs, is to be explained from what
has been said. Accordingly the mental powers develop much
earlier than the needs they are destined to serve; and here, as
everywhere, nature proceeds very designedly. For in this time
of predominating intelligence the man collects a great store of
knowledge for future wants which at the time are foreign to
him. Therefore his intellect, now unceasingly active, eagerly
apprehends all phenomena, broods over them and stores them up
carefully for the coming time,—like the bees, who gather a great
deal more honey than they can consume, in anticipation of future
need. Certainly what a man acquires of insight and knowledge
up to the age of puberty is, taken as a whole, more than all
that he afterwards learns, however learned he may become;[163]
for it is the foundation of all human knowledge. Up till the
same time plasticity predominates in the child's body, and later,
by a metastasis, its forces throw themselves into the system of
generation; and thus with puberty the sexual passion appears, and now, little by little, the will gains the upper hand. 

Then childhood, which is prevailingly theoretical and desirous of learning,
is followed by the restless, now stormy, now melancholy, period
of youth, which afterwards passes into the vigorous and earnest
age of manhood. Just because that impulse pregnant with evil
is wanting in the child is its volition so adapted and subordi-
nated to knowledge, whence arises that character of innocence,
intelligence, and reasonableness which is peculiar to the age of
childhood. On what, then, the likeness between childhood and
genius depends I scarcely need to express further: upon the sur-
plus of the powers of knowledge over the needs of the will, and
the predominance of the purely intellectual activity which springs
from this. Really every child is to a certain extent a genius, and
the genius is to a certain extent a child. The relationship of the
two shows itself primarily in the naïveté and sublime simplicity
which is characteristic of true genius; and besides this it appears
in several traits, so that a certain childishness certainly belongs
to the character of the genius. In Riemer's “Mittheilungen über
Goethe” (vol. i. p. 184) it is related that Herder and others found
fault with Goethe, saying he was always a big child. Certainly
they were right in what they said, but they were not right in
finding fault with it. It has also been said of Mozart that all
his life he remained a child (Nissen's Biography of Mozart, p.
2 and 529). Schlichtegroll's “Nekrology” (for 1791, vol. ii. p.
109) says of him: “In his art he early became a man, but in all
other relations he always remained a child.” Every genius is even
for this reason a big child; he looks out into the world as into
something strange, a play, and therefore with purely objective
interest. Accordingly he has just as little as the child that dull [164]
gravity of ordinary men, who, since they are capable only of
subjective interests, always see in things mere motives for their
action. Whoever does not to a certain extent remain all his life
a big child, but becomes a grave, sober, thoroughly composed,
and reasonable man, may be a very useful and capable citizen of
162 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
this world; but never a genius. In fact, the genius is so because
that predominance of the sensible system and of intellectual
activity which is natural to childhood maintains itself in him in
an abnormal manner through his whole life, thus here becomes
perennial. A trace of this certainly shows itself in many ordinary
men up to the period of their youth; therefore, for example, in
many students a purely intellectual tendency and an eccentricity
suggestive of genius is unmistakable. But nature returns to her
track; they assume the chrysalis form and reappear at the age of
manhood, as incarnate Philistines, at whom we are startled when
we meet them again in later years. Upon all this that has been
expounded here depends Goethe's beautiful remark: “Children do
not perform what they promise; young people very seldom; and
if they do keep their word, the world does not keep its word with
them” (Wahlverwandtschaften, Pt. i. ch. 10)—the world which
afterwards bestows the crowns which it holds aloft for merit on
those who are the tools of its low aims or know how to deceive
it. In accordance with what has been said, as there is a mere
beauty of youth, which almost every one at some time possesses
(beauté du diable), so there is a mere intellectuality of youth,
a certain mental nature disposed and adapted for apprehending,
understanding, and learning, which every one has in childhood,
and some have still in youth, but which is afterwards lost, just
like that beauty. Only in the case of a very few, the chosen,
the one, like the other, lasts through the whole life; so that even
in old age a trace of it still remains visible: these are the truly
beautiful and the men of true genius.[165]

The predominance of the cerebral nervous system and of
intelligence in childhood, which is here under consideration,
together with the decline of it in riper age, receives important
illustration and confirmation from the fact that in the species of
animals which stands nearest to man, the apes, the same relation
is found in a striking degree. It has by degrees become certain
that the highly intelligent orang-outang is a young pongo, which when it has grown up loses the remarkable human look of its
countenance, and also its astonishing intelligence, because the
lower and brutal part of its face increases in size, the forehead
thereby recedes, large cristæ, muscular developments, give the
skull a brutish form, the activity of the nervous system sinks, and
in its place extraordinary muscular strength develops, which, as
it is sufficient for its preservation, makes the great intelligence
now superfluous. Especially important is what Fréd. Cuvier has
said in this reference, and Flourens has illustrated in a review
of the “Histoire Naturelle” of the former, which appeared in the
September number of the “Journal des Savans” of 1839, and
was also separately printed with some additions, under the title,
“Résumé analytique des observations de Fr. Cuvier sur l'instinct
et l'intelligence des animaux,” p. Flourens, 1841. It is there
said, p. 50: “L'intelligence de l'orang-outang, cette intelligence
si développée, et développée de si bonne heure, décroit avec
l'âge. L'orang-outang, lorsqu'il est jeune, nous étonne par sa
pénétration, par sa ruse, par son adresse; l'orang-outang, deve-
nu adulte, n'est plus qu'un animal grossier, brutal, intraitable.
Et il en est de tous les singes comme de l'orang-outang. Dans
tous, l'intelligence décroit à mesure que les forces s'accroissent.
L'animal qui a le plus d'intelligence, n'a toute cette intelligence
que dans le jeune âge.” Further, p. 87: “Les singes de tous les
genres offrent ce rapport inverse de l'âge et de l'intelligence.
Ainsi, par exemple, l'Entelle (espèce de guenon du sous-genre
des Semno-pithèques et l'un des singes vénérés dans la religion
des Brames) a, dans le jeune âge, le front large, le museau [166]
peu saillant, le crâne élevé, arrondi, etc. Avec l'âge le front
disparait, recule, le museau proémine; et le moral ne change pas
moins que le physique: l'apathie, la violence, le besoin de soli-
tude, remplacent la pénétration, la docilité, la confiance. ‹ Ces
différences sont si grandes, › dit Mr. Fréd. Cuvier, ‹ que dans
l'habitude où nous sommes de juger des actions des animaux par
les nôtres, nous prendrions le jeune animal pour un individu de l'âge, où toutes les qualités morales de l'espèce sont acquises,
et l'Entelle adulte pour un individu qui n'aurait encore que ses
forces physiques. Mais la nature n'en agit pas ainsi avec ces
animaux, qui ne doivent pas sortir de la sphère étroite, qui leur
est fixée, et à qui il suffit en quelque sorte de pouvoir veiller à leur
conservation. Pour cela l'intelligence était nécessaire, quand
la force n'existait pas, et quand celle-ci est acquise, toute autre
puissance perd de son utilité. ›” And p. 118: “La conservation
des espèces ne repose pas moins sur les qualités intellectuelles
des animaux, que sur leurs qualités organiques.” This last con-
firms my principle that the intellect, like the claws and teeth, is
nothing else than a weapon in the service of the will.
