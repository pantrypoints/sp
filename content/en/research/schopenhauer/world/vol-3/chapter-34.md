18 This chapter is connected with § 49 of the first volume.

Not merely philosophy but also the fine arts work at bottom
towards the solution of the problem of existence. For in every
mind that once gives itself up to the purely objective contemplation of nature a desire has been excited, however concealed and
unconscious it may be, to comprehend the true nature of things,
of life and existence. For this alone has interest for the intellect
as such, i.e., for the pure subject of knowledge which has become
free from the aims of the will; as for the subject which knows as
a mere individual the aims of the will alone have interest. 

On this account the result of the purely objective apprehension of things is an expression more of the nature of life and existence, more an answer to the question, “What is life?” 

Every genuine and successful work of art answers this question in its own way
with perfect correctness. But all the arts speak only the naive
and childish language of perception, not the abstract and serious
language of reflection; their answer is therefore a fleeting image:
not permanent and general knowledge. Thus for perception every
work of art answers that question, every painting, every statue,
every poem, every scene upon the stage: music also answers it;
and indeed more profoundly than all the rest, for in its language,
which is understood with absolute directness, but which is yet
untranslatable into that of the reason, the inner nature of all [177]
life and existence expresses itself. Thus all the other arts hold
up to the questioner a perceptible image, and say, “Look here,
this is life.” Their answer, however correct it may be, will yet
always afford merely a temporary, not a complete and final,
satisfaction. For they always give merely a fragment, an example
instead of the rule, not the whole, which can only be given in
the universality of the conception. For this, therefore, thus for reflection and in the abstract, to give an answer which just on that
account shall be permanent and suffice for always, is the task of
philosophy. However, we see here upon what the relationship of
philosophy to the fine arts rests, and can conclude from that to
what extent the capacity of both, although in its direction and in
secondary matters very different, is yet in its root the same.
Every work of art accordingly really aims at showing us
life and things as they are in truth, but cannot be directly dis-
cerned by every one through the mist of objective and subjective
contingencies. Art takes away this mist.
The works of the poets, sculptors, and representative artists
in general contain an unacknowledged treasure of profound wis-
dom; just because out of them the wisdom of the nature of things
itself speaks, whose utterances they merely interpret by illus-
trations and purer repetitions. On this account, however, every
one who reads the poem or looks at the picture must certainly
contribute out of his own means to bring that wisdom to light;
accordingly he comprehends only so much of it as his capacity
and culture admit of; as in the deep sea each sailor only lets
down the lead as far as the length of the line will allow. Before
a picture, as before a prince, every one must stand, waiting to
see whether and what it will speak to him; and, as in the case
of a prince, so here he must not himself address it, for then he
would only hear himself. It follows from all this that in the
works of the representative arts all truth is certainly contained,
yet only virtualiter or implicite; philosophy, on the other hand,
endeavours to supply the same truth actualiter and explicite, and[178]
therefore, in this sense, is related to art as wine to grapes. What
it promises to supply would be, as it were, an already realised
and clear gain, a firm and abiding possession; while that which
proceeds from the achievements and works of art is one which
has constantly to be reproduced anew. Therefore, however, it
makes demands, not only upon those who produce its works, but
also upon those who are to enjoy them which are discouraging and hard to comply with. Therefore its public remains small,
while that of art is large.

The co-operation of the beholder, which is referred to above,
as demanded for the enjoyment of a work of art, depends partly
upon the fact that every work of art can only produce its effect
through the medium of the fancy; therefore it must excite this,
and can never allow it to be left out of the play and remain
inactive. 

This is a condition of the æsthetic effect, and therefore a fundamental law of all fine arts. But it follows from this that, through the work of art, everything must not be directly
given to the senses, but rather only so much as is demanded
to lead the fancy on to the right path; something, and indeed
the ultimate thing, must always be left over for the fancy to do.
Even the author must always leave something over for the reader
to think; for Voltaire has very rightly said, “Le secret d'être
ennuyeux, c'est de tout dire.” But besides this, in art the best of
all is too spiritual to be given directly to the senses; it must be
born in the imagination of the beholder, although begotten by
the work of art. It depends upon this that the sketches of great
masters often effect more than their finished pictures; although
another advantage certainly contributes to this, namely, that they
are completed offhand in the moment of conception; while the
perfected painting is only produced through continued effort,
by means of skilful deliberation and persistent intention, for the
inspiration cannot last till it is completed. From the fundamental
æsthetical law we are speaking of, it is further to be explained why wax figures never produce an æsthetic effect, and therefore are not properly works of fine art, although it is just in them that the imitation of nature is able to reach its highest grade. 

For they leave nothing for the imagination to do. Sculpture gives
merely the form without the colour; painting gives the colour,
but the mere appearance of the form; thus both appeal to the
imagination of the beholder. The wax figure, on the other hand,
gives all, form and colour at once; whence arises the appearance of reality, and the imagination is left out of account. Poetry, on the contrary, appeals indeed to the imagination alone, which it
sets in action by means of mere words. 

An arbitrary playing with the means of art without a proper
knowledge of the end is, in every art, the fundamental character-
istic of the dabbler. Such a man shows himself in the pillars that
support nothing, aimless volutes, juttings and projections of bad
architecture, in the meaningless runs and figures, together with
the aimless noise of bad music, in the jingling of the rhymes of
senseless poetry, &c.
It follows from the preceding chapter, and from my whole
view of art, that its aim is the facilitating of the knowledge of the
Ideas of the world (in the Platonic sense, the only one which I
recognise for the word Idea). The Ideas, however, are essentially
something perceptible, which, therefore, in its fuller determina-
tions, is inexhaustible. The communication of such an Idea can
therefore only take place on the path of perception, which is
that of art. Whoever, therefore, is filled with the comprehension
of an Idea is justified if he chooses art as the medium of its
communication. The mere conception, on the other hand, is
something completely determinable, therefore exhaustible, and
distinctly thought, the whole content of which can be coldly
and dryly expressed in words. Now to desire to communicate
such a conception by means of a work of art is a very useless
circumlocution, indeed belongs to that playing with the means of[180]
art without knowledge of its end which has just been condemned.
Therefore a work of art which has proceeded from mere distinct
conceptions is always ungenuine.

If now, in considering a work of plastic art, or in reading a poem, or in hearing a piece of
music (which aims at describing something definite), we see,
through all the rich materials of art, the distinct, limited, cold,
dry conception shine out, and at last come to the front, the
conception which was the kernel of this work, the whole notion
of which consequently consisted in the distinct thinking of it, and accordingly is absolutely exhausted by its communication, we feel disgusted and indignant, for we see ourselves deceived and
cheated out of our interest and attention. We are only perfectly
satisfied by the impression of a work of art when it leaves something which, with all our thinking about it, we cannot bring down
to the distinctness of a conception. The mark of that hybrid origin
from mere conceptions is that the author of a work of art could,
before he set about it, give in distinct words what he intended
to present; for then it would have been possible to attain his
whole end through these words. Therefore it is an undertaking as
unworthy as it is absurd if, as has often been tried at the present
day, one seeks to reduce a poem of Shakspeare's or Goethe's to
the abstract truth which it was its aim to communicate. Certainly
the artist ought to think in the arranging of his work; but only
that thought which was perceived before it was thought has afterwards, in its communication, the power of animating or rousing, and thereby becomes imperishable. We shall not refrain from
observing here that certainly the work which is done at a stroke,
like the sketches of painters already referred to, the work which is
completed in the inspiration of its first conception, and as it were
unconsciously dashed off, like the melody which comes entirely
without reflection, and quite as if by inspiration, and finally, also
the lyrical poem proper, the mere song, in which the deeply felt
mood of the present, and the impression of the surroundings, [181]
as if involuntarily, pours itself forth in words, whose metre and
rhyme come about of their own accord—that all these, I say, have
the great advantage of being purely the work of the ecstasy of the
moment, the inspiration, the free movement of genius, without
any admixture of intention and reflection; hence they are through
and through delightful and enjoyable, without shell and kernel,
and their effect is much more inevitable than that of the greatest
works of art, of slower and more deliberate execution. 

In all the latter, thus in great historical paintings, in long epic poems,
great operas, &c., reflection, intention, and deliberate selection has had an important part; understanding, technical skill, and routine must here fill up the gaps which the conception and
inspiration of genius has left, and must mix with these all kinds
of necessary supplementary work as cement of the only really
genuinely brilliant parts. This explains why all such works, only
excepting the perfect masterpieces of the very greatest masters
(as, for example, “Hamlet,” “Faust,” the opera of “Don Juan”),
inevitably contain an admixture of something insipid and weari-
some, which in some measure hinders the enjoyment of them.
Proofs of this are the “Messiah,” “Gerusalemme liberata,” even
“Paradise Lost” and the “Æneid;” and Horace already makes the
bold remark, “Quandoque dormitat bonus Homerus.” But that
this is the case is the consequence of the limitation of human
powers in general.

The mother of the useful arts is necessity; that of the fine arts
superfluity. As their father, the former have understanding; the
latter genius, which is itself a kind of superfluity, that of the
powers of knowledge beyond the measure which is required for
the service of the will.
