20 This chapter is connected with §§ 44-50 of the first volume.


In sculpture beauty and grace are the principal things; but in painting expression, passion, and character predominate; therefore just so much of the claims of beauty must be neglected. 

For a perfect beauty of all forms, such as sculpture demands, would detract from the characteristic and weary by monotony.
Accordingly painting may also present ugly faces and emaciated figures; sculpture, on the other hand, demands beauty, although not always perfect, but, throughout, strength and fulness of the figures. Consequently a thin Christ upon the Cross, a dying St. Jerome, wasted by age and disease, like the masterpiece
of Domenichino, is a proper subject for painting; while, on the
contrary, the marble figure by Donatello, in the gallery at Florence, of John the Baptist, reduced to skin and bone by fasting, has, in spite of the masterly execution, a repulsive effect. 

From  this point of view sculpture seems suitable for the affirmation, painting for the negation, of the will to live, and from this it may be explained why sculpture was the art of the ancients, while painting has been the art of the Christian era. 

In connection with the exposition given in § 45 of the first volume, that the discovery, recognition, and retention of the type of human beauty depends to a certain extent upon an anticipation of it, and therefore in part has an a priori foundation, I find that I have yet to bring out clearly the fact that this anticipation
nevertheless requires experience, by which it may be stirred up;
analogous to the instinct of the brutes, which, although guiding
the action a priori, yet requires determination by motives in the
details of it.

Experience and reality present to the intellect of the artist human forms, which, in one part or another, are more or less true to nature, as if it were asking for his judgment concerning
them, and thus, after the Socratic method, call forth from that
obscure anticipation the distinct and definite knowledge of the
ideal. Therefore it assisted the Greek sculptors very much that
the climate and customs of their country gave them opportunity
the whole day of seeing half-naked forms, and in the gymnasium
entirely naked forms. In this way every limb presented its plastic
significance to criticism, and to comparison with the ideal which
lay undeveloped in their consciousness. Thus they constantly
exercised their judgment with regard to all forms and limbs,
down to their finest shades of difference; and thus, little by little,
their originally dull anticipation of the ideal of human beauty was
raised to such distinct consciousness that they became capable of
objectifying it in works of art. In an entirely analogous manner
some experience is useful and necessary to the poet for the repre-
sentation of characters. For although he does not work according
to experience and empirical data, but in accordance with the clear
consciousness of the nature of humanity, as he finds it within
himself, yet experience serves this consciousness as a pattern,
incites it and gives it practice. Accordingly his knowledge of
human nature and its varieties, although in the main it proceeds a
priori and by anticipation, yet first receives life, definiteness, and
compass through experience. But, supporting ourselves upon the
preceding book and chapter 44 in the following book, we can go
still deeper into the ground of that marvellous sense of beauty
of the Greeks which made them alone of all nations upon earth [195]
capable of discovering the true normal type of the human form,
and accordingly of setting up the pattern of beauty and grace for
the imitation of all ages, and we can say: The same thing which,
if it remains unseparated from the will, gives sexual instinct
with its discriminating selection, i.e., sexual love (which it is
well known was subject among the Greeks to great aberrations),
becomes, if, by the presence of an abnormally preponderating
192 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
intellect, it separates itself from the will and yet remains active,
the objective sense of beauty of the human form, which now
shows itself primarily as a critical artistic sense, but can rise to
the discovery and representation of the norm of all parts and
proportions; as was the case in Phidias, Praxiteles, Scopas, &c.
Then is fulfilled what Goethe makes the artist say—
“That I with mind divine
And human hand
May be able to form
What with my wife,
As animal, I can and must.”

And again, analogous to this, that which in the poet, if it
remained unseparated from the will, would give only worldly
prudence, becomes, if it frees itself from the will by abnor-
mal preponderance of the intellect, the capacity for objective,
dramatic representation.

Modern sculpture, whatever it may achieve, is still analogous
to modern Latin poetry, and, like this, is a child of imitation,
sprung from reminiscences. If it presumes to try to be original,
it at once goes astray, especially upon the bad path of forming
according to nature as it lies before it, instead of according to
the proportions of the ancients. Canova, Thorwaldsen, and many
others may be compared to Johannes Secundus and Owenus. 

It is the same with architecture, only there it is founded in the art
itself, the purely æsthetic part of which is of small compass, and
was already exhausted by the ancients; therefore the modern[196]
architect can only distinguish himself in the wise application of
it; and he ought to know that he removes himself from good taste
just so far as he departs from the style and pattern of the Greeks.
The art of the painter, considered only so far as it aims at
producing the appearance of reality, may ultimately be referred to
the fact that he understands how to separate purely what in seeing
is the mere sensation, thus the affection of the retina, i.e., the only directly given effect, from its cause, i.e., the objective external world, the perception of which first rises in the understanding
from this effect; whereby, if he has technical skill, he is in a
position to produce the same effect in the eye through an entirely
different cause, the patches of applied colour, from which then
in the understanding of the beholder the same perception again
arises through the unavoidable reference of the effect to the
ordinary cause.

If we consider how there lies something so entirely idiosyn-
cratic, so thoroughly original, in every human countenance, and
that it presents a whole which can only belong to a unity consist-
ing entirely of necessary parts by virtue of which we recognise
a known individual out of so many thousands, even after long
years, although the possible variations of human features, es-
pecially of one race, lie within very narrow limits, we must
doubt whether anything of such essential unity and such great
originality could ever proceed from any other source than from
the mysterious depths of the inner being of nature; but from
this it would follow that no artist could be capable of really
reproducing the original peculiarity of a human countenance,
or even of composing it according to nature from recollection.
Accordingly what he produced of this kind would always be
only a half true, nay, perhaps an impossible composition; for
how should he compose an actual physiognomical unity when
the principle of this unity is really unknown to him? Therefore,
in the case of every face which has merely been imagined by [197]
an artist, we must doubt whether it is in fact a possible face, and
whether nature, as the master of all masters, would not show it to
be a bungled production by pointing out complete contradictions
in it. This would, of course, lead to the principle that in historical
paintings only portraits ought to figure, which certainly would
then have to be selected with the greatest care and in some degree
idealised. It is well known that great artists have always gladly
painted from living models and introduced many portraits.

Although, as is explained in the text, the real end of painting,
as of art in general, is to make the comprehension of the (Pla-
tonic) Ideas of the nature of the world easier for us, whereby we
are at once thrown into the state of pure, i.e., will-less, knowing,
there yet belongs to it besides this an independent beauty of its
own, which is produced by the mere harmony of the colours, the
pleasingness of the grouping, the happy distribution of light and
shade, and the tone of the whole picture. This accompanying
subordinate kind of beauty furthers the condition of pure know-
ing, and is in painting what the diction, the metre, and rhyme are
in poetry; both are not what is essential, but what acts first and
immediately.

I have some further evidence to give in support of my judg-
ment given in the first volume, § 50, on the inadmissibleness
of allegory in painting. In the Borghese palace at Rome there
is the following picture by Michael Angelo Caravaggio: Jesus,
as a child of about ten years old, treads upon the head of a
serpent, but entirely without fear and with great calmness; and
His mother, who accompanies Him, remains quite as indifferent.
Close by stands St. Elizabeth, looking solemnly and tragically
up to heaven. Now what could be thought of this kyriological
hieroglyphic by a man who had never heard anything about the
seed of the woman that should bruise the head of the serpent?
At Florence, in the library of the palace Riccardi, we find the[198]
following allegory upon the ceiling, painted by Luca Giordano,
which is meant to signify that science frees the understanding
from the bonds of ignorance: the understanding is a strong man
bound with cords, which are just falling off; a nymph holds a
mirror in front of him, another hands him a large detached wing;
above sits science on a globe, and beside her, with a globe in her
hand, the naked truth. At Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart, there is a
picture which shows us time, as Saturn, cutting off with a pair of
shears the wings of Cupid. If this is meant to signify that when
we grow old love proves unstable, this no doubt has its truth.

The following may serve to strengthen my solution of the
problem as to why Laocoon does not cry out. One may practical-
ly convince oneself of the faulty effect of the representation of
shrieking by the works of the plastic and pictorial arts, which are
essentially dumb, by a picture of the slaughter of the innocents,
by Guido Reni, which is to be found in the Academy of Arts
at Bologna, and in which this great artist has committed the
mistake of painting six shrieking wide-open mouths. Let any
one who wants to have this more distinct think of a pantomimic
representation on the stage, and in one of the scenes an urgent
occasion for one of the players to shriek; if now the dancer who
is representing this part should express the shriek by standing for
a while with his mouth wide open, the loud laughter of the whole
house would bear witness to the absurdity of the thing. 

Accordingly, since the shrieking of Laocoon had to be avoided for
reasons which did not lie in the objects to be represented, but in
the nature of the representing art, the task thus arose for the artist
so to present this not-shrieking as to make it plausible to us that a
man in such a position should not shriek. He solves this problem
by representing the bite of the snake, not as having already taken
place, nor yet as still threatening, but as just happening now in
the side; for thereby the lower part of the body is contracted, and shrieking made impossible. This immediate but only subordinate reason was correctly discovered by Goethe, and is expounded
at the end of the eleventh book of his autobiography, and also
in the paper on Laocoon in the first part of the Propylæa; but
the ultimate, primary reason, which conditions this one, is that
which I have set forth. I cannot refrain from remarking that I
here stand in the same relation to Goethe as with reference to the
theory of colours. In the collection of the Duke of Aremberg at
Brussels there is an antique head of Laocoon which was found
later. However, the head in the world-renowned group is not a
restored one which follows from Goethe's special table of all the
restorations of this group, which is given at the end of the first volume of the Propylæa, and is also confirmed by the fact that the head which was found later resembles that of the group very
much. Thus we must assume that another antique repetition of
the group has existed to which the Aremberg head belonged. In
my opinion the latter excels both in beauty and expression that
of the group. It has the mouth decidedly wider open than in the
group, yet not really to the extent of shrieking.
