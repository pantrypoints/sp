21 This chapter is connected with § 51 of the first volume.


Poetry is the art of bringing the imagination into play through words.

How it brings this to pass I have shown in the first volume, § 51. 

This is confirmed by Wieland to Merck: 

“I have spent 2.5 days on a single stanza, in which the whole thing ultimately depended upon a single word which I wanted
and could not find. I revolved and turned about the thing and
my brain in all directions, because naturally, where a picture was
in question, I desired to bring the same definite vision, which
floated before my own mind into the mind of my reader also,
and for this all often depends, ut nosti, upon a single touch
or suggestion or reflex” (Briefe an Merck, edited by Wagner,
1835, p. 193). 

From the fact that the imagination of the reader is the material in which poetry exhibits its pictures, it has the
advantage that the fuller development of these pictures and their
finer touches, take place in the imagination of every one just as is
most suitable to his individuality, his sphere of knowledge, and
his humour, and therefore move him in the most lively manner;
instead of which plastic and pictorial art cannot so adapt itself,
but here one picture, one form, must satisfy all. And yet this
will always bear in some respect the stamp of the individuality
of the artist or of his model, as a subjective or accidental and [201]
inefficient addition; although always less so the more objective,
i.e., the more of a genius, the artist is. This, to some extent,
explains why works of poetry exercise a much stronger, deeper,
and more universal effect than pictures and statues; the latter,
for the most part, leave the common people quite cold; and, in general, the plastic arts are those which have the weakest effect. 

A remarkable proof of this is afforded by the frequent discovery
and disclosure of pictures by great masters in private houses and
all kinds of localities, where they have been hanging for many
generations, not buried and concealed, but merely unheeded, thus
without any effect. In my time (1823) there was even discovered
in Florence a Madonna of Raphael's, which had hung for a long
series of years on the wall of the servants' hall of a palace (in
the Quartiere di S. Spirito); and this happens among Italians,
the nation which is gifted beyond all others with the sense of
the beautiful. It shows how little direct and immediate effect
the works of plastic and pictorial art have, and that it requires
more culture and knowledge to prize them than the works of all
other arts. How unfailingly, on the contrary, a beautiful melody
that touches the heart makes its journey round the world, and an
excellent poem wanders from people to people. That the great
and rich devote their powerful support just to the plastic and
pictorial arts, and expend considerable sums upon their works
only; nay, at the present day, an idolatry, in the proper sense
of the term, gives the value of a large estate for a picture of a
celebrated old master—this depends principally upon the rarity
of the masterpieces, the possession of which therefore gratifies
pride; and then also upon the fact that the enjoyment of them
demands very little time and effort, and is ready at any moment,
for a moment; while poetry and even music make incomparably
harder conditions. Corresponding to this, the plastic and pictorial
arts may be dispensed with; whole nations—for example, the
Mohammedan peoples—are without them, but no people is[202]
without music and poetry.

But the intention with which the poet sets our imagination in
motion is to reveal to us the Ideas, i.e., to show us by an example
what life and what the world is. The first condition of this is that
he himself has known it; according as his knowledge has been
profound or superficial so will his poem be. Therefore, as there are innumerable degrees of profoundness and clearness in the
comprehension of the nature of things, so are there of poets. Each
of these, however, must regard himself as excellent so far as he
has correctly represented what he knew, and his picture answers
to his original: he must make himself equal with the best, for even
in the best picture he does not recognise more than in his own,
that is, as much as he sees in nature itself; for his glance cannot
now penetrate deeper. But the best himself recognises himself
as such in the fact that he sees how superficial was the view of
the others, how much lay beyond it which they were not able to
repeat, because they did not see it, and how much further his own
glance and picture reaches. If he understood the superficial poets
as little as they do him, then he would necessarily despair; for
just because it requires an extraordinary man to do him justice,
but the inferior poets can just as little esteem him as he can them,
he also has long to live upon his own approval before that of
the world follows it. Meanwhile he is deprived even of his own
approval, for he is expected to be very modest. It is, however,
as impossible that he who has merit, and knows what it costs,
should himself be blind to it, as that a man who is six feet high
should not observe that he rises above others. If from the base
of the tower to the summit is 300 feet, then certainly it is just
as much from the summit to the base. Horace, Lucretius, Ovid,
and almost all the ancients have spoken proudly of themselves,
and also Dante, Shakspeare, Bacon of Verulam, and many more.
That one can be a great man without observing anything of it is an
absurdity of which only hopeless incapacity can persuade itself, [203]
in order that it may regard the feeling of its own insignificance as
modesty. An Englishman has wittily and correctly observed that
merit and modesty have nothing in common except the initial
letter.22 I have always a suspicion about modest celebrities that
22 Lichtenberg (“Vermischte Schriften,” new edition, Göttingen, 1884, vol. iii.
p. 19) quotes Stanislaus Leszczynski as having said, “La modestie devroit être
la vertu de ceux, a qui les autres manquent.”
200 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
they may very well be right; and Corneille says directly—
“La fausse humilité ne met plus en crédit:
Je sçais ce que je vaux, et crois ce qu'on m'en dit.”
Finally, Goethe has frankly said, “Only good-for-nothings are
modest.” But the assertion would be still more certain that those
who so eagerly demand modesty from others, urge modesty, un-
ceasingly cry, “Only be modest, for God's sake, only be modest!”
are positively good-for-nothings, i.e., persons entirely without
merit, manufactures of nature, ordinary members of the great
mass of humanity. For he who himself has merit also concedes
merit—understands himself truly and really. But he who himself
lacks all excellence and merit wishes there was no such thing: the
sight of it in others stretches him upon the rack; pale, green, and
yellow envy consumes his heart: he would like to annihilate and
destroy all those who are personally favoured; but if unfortunate-
ly he must let them live, it must only be under the condition that
they conceal, entirely deny, nay, abjure their advantages. This,
then, is the root of the frequent eulogising of modesty. And if the
deliverers of these eulogies have the opportunity of suppressing
merit as it arises, or at least of hindering it from showing itself
or being known, who can doubt that they will do it? For this is
the practice of their theory.

The poet always brings before
us only the particular, the individual, what he has known, and[204]
wishes by his work to make us know, is the (Platonic) Idea, the
whole species; therefore in his images, as it were, the type of
human characters and situations will be impressed. The narrative
and also the dramatic poet takes the whole particular from life,
and describes it accurately in its individuality, but yet reveals in
this way the whole of human existence; for although he seems
to have to do with the particular, in truth he is concerned with
that which is everywhere and at all times. Hence it arises that
Chapter XXXVII. On The Æsthetics Of Poetry. 201
sentences, especially of the dramatic poets, even without being
general apophthegms, find frequent application in actual life. Po-
etry is related to philosophy as experience is related to empirical
science. Experience makes us acquainted with the phenomenon
in the particular and by means of examples, science embraces
the whole of phenomena by means of general conceptions. So
poetry seeks to make us acquainted with the (Platonic) Ideas
through the particular and by means of examples. Philosophy
aims at teaching, as a whole and in general, the inner nature of
things which expresses itself in these. One sees even here that
poetry bears more the character of youth, philosophy that of old
age. In fact, the gift of poetry really only flourishes in youth; and
also the susceptibility for poetry is often passionate in youth: the
youth delights in verses as such, and is often contented with small
ware. This inclination gradually diminishes with years, and in
old age one prefers prose. By that poetical tendency of youth the
sense of the real is then easily spoiled. For poetry differs from
reality by the fact that in it life flows past us, interesting and yet
painless; while in reality, on the contrary, so long as it is painless
it is uninteresting, and as soon as it becomes interesting, it does
not remain without pain. The youth who has been initiated into
poetry earlier than into reality now desires from the latter what
only the former can achieve; this is a principal source of the
discomfort which oppresses the most gifted youths. [205]
Metre and rhyme are a fetter, but also a veil which the poet
throws round him, and under which he is permitted to speak as he
otherwise dared not do; and that is what gives us pleasure. He is
only half responsible for all that he says; metre and rhyme must
answer for the other half. Metre, or measure, as mere rhythm,
has its existence only in time, which is a pure perception a priori,
thus, to use Kant's language, belongs merely to pure sensibility;
rhyme, on the other hand, is an affair of sensation, in the organ
of hearing, thus of empirical sensibility. 

Therefore rhythm is
a much nobler and more worthy expedient than rhyme, which the ancients accordingly despised, and which found its origin
in those imperfect languages which arose from the corruption
of earlier ones and in barbarous times. The poorness of French
poetry depends principally upon the fact that it is confined to
rhyme alone without metre, and it is increased by the fact that in
order to conceal its want of means it has increased the difficulty
of rhyming by a number of pedantic laws, such as, for example,
that only syllables which are written the same way rhyme, as if
it were for the eye and not for the ear that the hiatus is forbidden;
that a number of words must not occur; and many such, to
all of which the new school of French poetry seeks to put an
end. In no language, however, at least on me, does the rhyme
make such a pleasing and powerful impression as in Latin; the
rhymed Latin poems of the Middle Ages have a peculiar charm.
This must be explained from the fact that the Latin language is
incomparably more perfect, more beautiful and noble, than any
modern language, and now moves so gracefully in the ornaments
and spangles which really belong to the latter, and which it itself
originally despised.

To serious consideration it might almost appear as high treason
against our reason that even the slightest violence should be done
to a thought or its correct and pure expression, with the childish
intention that after some syllables the same sound of word should[206]
be heard, or even that these syllables themselves should present
a kind of rhythmical beat. But without such violence very few
verses would be made; for it must be attributed to this that in
foreign languages verses are much more difficult to understand
than prose. If we could see into the secret workshops of the poets,
we would find that the thought is sought for the rhyme ten times
oftener than the rhyme for the thought; and even when the latter
is the case, it is not easily accomplished without pliability on the
part of the thought. But the art of verse bids defiance to these
considerations, and, moreover, has all ages and peoples upon its
side, so great is the power which metre and rhyme exercise upon the feeling, and so effective the mysterious lenocinium which belongs to them. 

I would explain this from the fact that a happily
rhymed verse, by its indescribably emphatic effect, raises the
feeling as if the thought expressed in it lay already predestined,
nay, performed in the language, and the poet has only had to
find it out. Even trivial thoughts receive from rhythm and rhyme
a touch of importance; cut a figure in this attire, as among
girls plain faces attract the eye by finery. Nay, even distorted
and false thoughts gain through versification an appearance of
truth. On the other hand, even famous passages from famous
poets shrink together and become insignificant when they are
reproduced accurately in prose. If only the true is beautiful, and
the dearest ornament of truth is nakedness, then a thought which
appears true and beautiful in prose will have more true worth
than one which affects us in the same way in verse. Now it
is very striking, and well worth investigating, that such trifling,
nay, apparently childish, means as metre and rhyme produce
so powerful an effect. I explain it to myself in the following
manner: That which is given directly to the sense of hearing,
thus the mere sound of the words, receives from rhythm and
rhyme a certain completeness and significance in itself for it [207]
thereby becomes a kind of music; therefore it seems now to exist
for its own sake, and no longer as a mere means, mere signs
of something signified, the sense of the words. To please the
ear with its sound seems to be its whole end, and therefore with
this everything seems to be attained and all claims satisfied. But
that it further contains a meaning, expresses a thought, presents
itself now as an unexpected addition, like words to music—as an
unexpected present which agreeably surprises us—and therefore,
since we made no demands of this kind, very easily satisfies
us; and if indeed this thought is such that, in itself, thus said in
prose, it would also be significant, then we are enchanted. I can
remember, in my early childhood, that I had delighted myself for
a long time with the agreeable sound of verse before I made the discovery that it all also contained meaning and thoughts. 

Accordingly there is also, in all languages, a mere doggerel poetry
almost entirely devoid of meaning. Davis, the Sinologist, in the
preface to his translation of the “Laou-sang-urh,” or “An Heir
in Old Age” (London, 1817), observes that the Chinese dramas
partly consist of verses which are sung, and adds: “The meaning
of them is often obscure, and, according to the statements of the
Chinese themselves, the end of these verses is especially to flatter
the ear, and the sense is neglected, and even entirely sacrificed
to the harmony.” Who is not reminded here of the choruses of
many Greek tragedies which are often so hard to make out?
The sign by which one most immediately recognises the gen-
uine poet, both of the higher and lower species, is the unforced
nature of his rhymes. They have appeared of themselves as if by
divine arrangement; his thoughts come to him already in rhyme.
The homely, prosaic man on the contrary, seeks the rhyme for
the thought; the bungler seeks the thought for the rhyme. Very
often one can find out from a couple of rhymed verses which of
the two had the thought and which had the rhyme as its father.[208]
The art consists in concealing the latter, so that such lines may
not appear almost as mere stuffed out boutsrimés.

According to my feeling (proofs cannot here be given) rhyme
is from its nature binary: its effect is limited to one single recur-
rence of the same sound, and is not strengthened by more frequent
repetition. Thus whenever a final syllable has received the one
of the same sound its effect is exhausted; the third recurrence
of the note acts merely as a second rhyme which accidentally
hits upon the same sound, but without heightening the effect; it
links itself on to the existing rhyme, yet without combining with
it to produce a stronger impression. For the first note does not
sound through the second on to the third: therefore this is an
æsthetic pleonasm, a double courage which is of no use. Least of
all, therefore, do such accumulations of rhymes merit the heavy
sacrifices which they cost in the octave rhyme, the terza rima, and the sonnet, and which are the cause of the mental torture
under which we sometimes read such productions, for poetical
pleasure is impossible under the condition of racking our brains.
That the great poetical mind sometimes overcomes even these
forms, and moves in them with ease and grace, does not extend
to a recommendation of the forms themselves, for in themselves
they are as ineffectual as they are difficult. And even in good
poets, when they make use of these forms, we frequently see the
conflict between the rhyme and the thought, in which now one
and now the other gains the victory; thus either the thought is
stunted for the sake of the rhyme, or the rhyme has to be satisfied
with a weak à peu près. Since this is so, I do not regard it
as an evidence of ignorance, but as a proof of good taste, that
Shakspeare in his sonnets has given different rhymes to each
quatraine. At any rate, their acoustic effect is not in the least
diminished by it, and the thought obtains its rights far more than
it could have done if it had had to be laced up in the customary
Spanish boots.

It is a disadvantage for the poetry of a language if it has many
words which cannot be used in prose, and, on the other hand,
dare not use certain words of prose. The former is mostly the
case in Latin and Italian poetry, and the latter in French, where it
has recently been very aptly called, “La bégeulerie de la langue
française;” both are to be found less in English, and least in
German. For such words belonging exclusively to poetry remain
foreign to our heart, do not speak to us directly, and therefore
leave us cold. They are a conventional language of poetry, and as
it were mere painted sensations instead of real ones: they exclude
genuine feeling.

The distinction, so often discussed in our own day, between
classic and romantic poetry seems to me ultimately to depend
upon the fact that the former knows no other motives than those
which are purely human, actual, and natural; the latter, on the
other hand, also treats artificial conventional, and imaginary motives as efficient. To such belong the motives which spring from the Christian mythus, also from the chivalrous over-strained
fantastical law of honour, further from the absurd and ludicrous
Germano-Christian veneration of women, and lastly from doting
and mooning hyperphysical amorousness. But even in the best
poets of the romantic class, e.g., in Calderon, we can see to
what ridiculous distortions of human relations and human nature
these motives lead. Not to speak of the Autos, I merely refer
to such pieces as “No siempre el peor es cierto” (The worst is
not always certain), and “El postrero duelo en España” (The last
duel in Spain), and similar comedies en capa y espada: with the
elements mentioned there is here further associated the scholas-
tic subtility so often appearing in the conversation which at that
time belonged to the mental culture of the higher classes. How
decidedly advantageous, on the contrary, is the position of the
poetry of the ancients, which always remains true to nature; and
the result is that classical poetry has an unconditional, romantic
poetry only a conditional, truth and correctness; analogous to[210]
Greek and Gothic architecture. Yet, on the other hand, we must
remark here that all dramatic or narrative poems which transfer
their scene to ancient Greece or Rome lose by this from the
fact that our knowledge of antiquity, especially in what concerns
the details of life, is insufficient, fragmentary, and not drawn
from perception. This obliges the poet to avoid much and to
content himself with generalities, whereby he becomes abstract,
and his work loses that concreteness and individualisation which
is throughout essential to poetry. It is this which gives all such
works the peculiar appearance of emptiness and tediousness.
Only Shakspeare's works of this kind are free from it; because
without hesitation he has presented, under the names of Greeks
and Romans, Englishmen of his own time.

It has been objected to many masterpieces of lyrical poetry,
especially some Odes of Horace (see, for example, the second
of the third book) and several of Goethe's songs (for example, “The Shepherd's Lament”), that they lack proper connection and
are full of gaps in the thought. But here the logical connection is
intentionally neglected, in order that the unity of the fundamental
sensation and mood may take its place, which comes out more
clearly just by the fact that it passes like a thread through the
separate pearls, and brings about the quick changes of the objects
of contemplation, in the same way as in music the transition from
one key to another is brought about by the chord of the seventh,
through which the still sounding fundamental note becomes the
dominant of the new key. Most distinctly, even exaggeratedly,
the quality here described is found in the Canzone of Petrarch
which begins, “Mai non vo' più cantar, com' io soleva.”
Accordingly, as in the lyrical poem the subjective element
predominates, so in the drama, on the contrary, the objective
element is alone and exclusively present. Between the two epic [211]
poetry in all its forms and modifications, from the narrative ro-
mance to the epos proper, has a broad middle path. For although
in the main it is objective, yet it contains a subjective element,
appearing now more and now less, which finds its expression
in the tone, in the form of the delivery, and also in scattered
reflections. We do not so entirely lose sight of the poet as in the
drama.

The end of the drama in general is to show us in an example
what is the nature and existence of man. The sad or the bright
side of these can be turned to us in it, or their transitions into
each other. But the expression, “nature and existence of man,”
already contains the germ of the controversy whether the nature,
i.e., the character, or the existence, i.e., the fate, the adventures,
the action, is the principal thing. Moreover, the two have grown
so firmly together that although they can certainly be separated
in conception, they cannot be separated in the representation of
them. For only the circumstances, the fate, the events, make
the character manifest its nature, and only from the character
does the action arise from which the events proceed. Certainly,
208 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
in the representation, the one or the other may be made more
prominent; and in this respect the piece which centres in the
characters and the piece which centres in the plot are the two
extremes.
The common end of the drama and the epic, to exhibit, in
significant characters placed in significant situations, the extraor-
dinary actions brought about by both, will be most completely
attained by the poet if he first introduces the characters to us in
a state of peace, in which merely their general colour becomes
visible, and allows a motive to enter which produces an action,
out of which a new and stronger motive arises, which again calls
forth a more significant action, which, in its turn, begets new
and even stronger motives, whereby, then, in the time suitable to
the form of the poem, the most passionate excitement takes the[212]
place of the original peace, and in this now the important actions
occur in which the qualities of the characters which have hitherto
slumbered are brought clearly to light, together with the course
of the world.
Great poets transform themselves into each of the persons to
be represented, and speak out of each of them like ventriloquists;
now out of the hero, and immediately afterwards out of the
young and innocent maiden, with equal truth and naturalness: so
Shakspeare and Goethe. Poets of the second rank transform the
principal person to be represented into themselves. This is what
Byron does; and then the other persons often remain lifeless,
as is the case even with the principal persons in the works of
mediocre poets.

Our pleasure in tragedy belongs, not to the sense of the beau-
tiful, but to that of the sublime; nay, it is the highest grade of
this feeling. For, as at the sight of the sublime in nature we
turn away from the interests of the will, in order to be purely
perceptive, so in the tragic catastrophe we turn away even from
the will to live. In tragedy the terrible side of life is presented
to us, the wail of humanity, the reign of chance and error, the fall of the just, the triumph of the wicked; thus the aspect of the
world which directly strives against our will is brought before
our eyes. At this sight we feel ourselves challenged to turn away
our will from life, no longer to will it or love it. But just in this
way we become conscious that then there still remains something
over to us, which we absolutely cannot know positively, but only
negatively, as that which does not will life. As the chord of
the seventh demands the fundamental chord; as the colour red
demands green, and even produces it in the eye; so every tragedy
demands an entirely different kind of existence, another world,
the knowledge of which can only be given us indirectly just as
here by such a demand. In the moment of the tragic catastrophe
the conviction becomes more distinct to us than ever that life [213]
is a bad dream from which we have to awake. So far the effect
of the tragedy is analogous to that of the dynamical sublime, for
like this it lifts us above the will and its interests, and puts us
in such a mood that we find pleasure in the sight of what tends
directly against it. What gives to all tragedy, in whatever form
it may appear, the peculiar tendency towards the sublime is the
awakening of the knowledge that the world, life, can afford us no
true pleasure, and consequently is not worthy of our attachment.
In this consists the tragic spirit: it therefore leads to resignation.
I admit that in ancient tragedy this spirit of resignation seldom
appears and is expressed directly. Œdipus Colonus certainly dies
resigned and willing; yet he is comforted by the revenge on his
country. Iphigenia at Aulis is very willing to die; yet it is the
thought of the welfare of Greece that comforts her, and occasions
the change of her mind, on account of which she willingly accepts
the death which at first she sought to avoid by any means. Cas-
sandra, in the Agamemnon of the great Æschylus, dies willingly,
±¡∫μπƒ… ≤πø¬ (1306); but she also is comforted by the thought
of revenge. Hercules, in the Trachiniæ, submits to necessity,
and dies composed, but not resigned. So also the Hippolytus
of Euripides, in whose case it surprises us that Artemis, who
210 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
appears to comfort him, promises him temples and fame, but
never points him to an existence beyond life, and leaves him in
death, as all gods forsake the dying:—in Christianity they come
to him; and so also in Brahmanism and Buddhism, although
in the latter the gods are really exotic. Thus Hippolytus, like
almost all the tragic heroes of the ancients, shows submission
to inevitable fate and the inflexible will of the gods, but no
surrender of the will to live itself. As the Stoic equanimity is
fundamentally distinguished from Christian resignation by the
fact that it teaches only patient endurance and composed expec-
tation of unalterably necessary evil, while Christianity teaches[214]
renunciation, surrender of the will; so also the tragic heroes
of the ancients show resolute subjection under the unavoidable
blows of fate, while Christian tragedy, on the contrary, shows the
surrender of the whole will to live, joyful forsaking of the world
in the consciousness of its worthlessness and vanity. But I am
also entirely of opinion that modern tragedy stands higher than
that of the ancients. Shakspeare is much greater than Sophocles;
in comparison with Goethe's Iphigenia one might find that of
Euripides almost crude and vulgar. The Bacchæ of Euripides is
a revolting composition in favour of the heathen priests. Many
ancient pieces have no tragic tendency at all, like the Alcestis
and Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides; some have disagreeable,
or even disgusting motives, like the Antigone and Philocteles.
Almost all show the human race under the fearful rule of chance
and error, but not the resignation which is occasioned by it, and
delivers from it. All because the ancients had not yet attained
to the summit and goal of tragedy, or indeed of the view of life
itself.

Although, then, the ancients displayed little of the spirit of
resignation, the turning away of the will from life, in their tragic
heroes themselves, as their frame of mind, yet the peculiar ten-
dency and effect of tragedy remains the awakening of that spirit
in the beholder, the calling up of that frame of mind, even though
Chapter XXXVII. On The Æsthetics Of Poetry. 211
only temporarily. The horrors upon the stage hold up to him
the bitterness and worthlessness of life, thus the vanity of all its
struggle. The effect of this impression must be that he becomes
conscious, if only in obscure feeling, that it is better to tear his
heart free from life, to turn his will from it, to love not the world
nor life; whereby then in his deepest soul, the consciousness
is aroused that for another kind of willing there must also be
another existence. For if this were not so, then the tendency of
tragedy would not be this rising above all the ends and good [215]
things of life, this turning away from it and its seductions, and
the turning towards another kind of existence, which already lies
in this, although an existence which is for us quite inconceivable.
How would it, then, in general, be possible that the exhibition
of the most terrible side of life, brought before our eyes in the
most glaring light, could act upon us beneficently, and afford
us a lofty satisfaction? Fear and sympathy, in the excitement of
which Aristotle places the ultimate end of tragedy, certainly do
not in themselves belong to the agreeable sensations: therefore
they cannot be the end, but only the means. Thus the summons to
turn away the will from life remains the true tendency of tragedy,
the ultimate end of the intentional exhibition of the suffering
of humanity, and is so accordingly even where this resigned
exaltation of the mind is not shown in the hero himself, but is
merely excited in the spectator by the sight of great, unmerited,
nay, even merited suffering. Many of the moderns also are, like
the ancients, satisfied with throwing the spectator into the mood
which has been described, by the objective representation of
human misfortune as a whole; while others exhibit this through
the change of the frame of mind of the hero himself, effected
by suffering. 

The former give, as it were, only the premisses,
and leave the conclusion to the spectator; while the latter give
the conclusion, or the moral of the fable, also, as the change of
the frame of mind of the hero, and even also as reflection, in the
mouth of the chorus, as, for example, Schiller in “The Bride of Messina:” “Life is not the highest good.” Let me remark here that the genuine tragic effect of the catastrophe, thus the resignation
and exaltation of the mind of the hero which is brought about by
it, seldom appears so purely motived and so distinctly expressed
as in the opera of “Norma,” where it comes in in the duet, “Qual
cor tradisti, qual cor perdesti,” in which the change of the will is
distinctly indicated by the quietness which is suddenly introduced
into the music. In general, this piece—regarded apart altogether[216]
from its excellent music, and also from the diction which can
only be that of a libretto, and considered only according to its
motives and its inner economy—is a highly perfect tragedy, a
true pattern of tragic disposition of the motives, tragic progress
of the action, and tragic development, together with the effect of
these upon the frame of mind of the hero, raising it above the
world, and which is then also communicated to the spectator;
indeed the effect attained here is the less delusive and the more
indicative of the true nature of tragedy that no Christians, nor
even Christian ideas, appear in it.
The neglect of the unity of time and place with which the
moderns are so often reproached is only a fault when it goes so
far that it destroys the unity of the action; for then there only
remains the unity of the principal character, as, for example, in
Shakspeare's “Henry VIII.” But even the unity of the action does
not need to go so far that the same thing is spoken of throughout,
as in the French tragedies which in general observe this so strictly
that the course of the drama is like a geometrical line without
breadth. There it is constantly a case of “Only get on! Pensez
à votre affaire!” and the thing is expedited and hurried on in
a thoroughly business fashion, and no one detains himself with
irrelevances which do not belong to it, or looks to the right or
the left. 

The Shakspearian tragedy, on the other hand, is like a
line which has also breadth: it takes time, exspatiatur: speeches
and even whole scenes occur which do not advance the action,
indeed do not properly concern it, by which, however, we get to know the characters or their circumstances more fully, and then understand the action also more thoroughly. This certainly
remains the principal thing, yet not so exclusively that we forget
that in the last instance what is aimed at is the representation of
human nature and existence generally.

The dramatic or epic poet ought to know that he is fate, [217]
and should therefore be inexorable, as it is; also that he is the
mirror of the human race, and should therefore represent very
many bad and sometimes profligate characters, and also many
fools, buffoons, and eccentric persons; then also, now and again,
a reasonable, a prudent, an honest, or a good man, and only as
the rarest exception a truly magnanimous man. In the whole of
Homer there is in my opinion no really magnanimous character
presented, although many good and honest. In the whole of
Shakspeare there may be perhaps a couple of noble, though by
no means transcendently noble, characters to be found; perhaps
Cordelia, Coriolanus—hardly more; on the other hand, his works
swarm with the species indicated above. But Iffland's and Kotze-
bue's pieces have many magnanimous characters; while Goldoni
has done as I recommended above, whereby he shows that he
stands higher. On the other hand, Schiller's “Minna von Barn-
helm” labours under too much and too universal magnanimity;
but so much magnanimity as the one Marquis Posa displays is
not to be found in the whole of Goethe's works together. There
is, however, a small German piece called “Duty for Duty's Sake”
(a title which sounds as if it had been taken from the Critique of
Practical Reason), which has only three characters, and yet all
the three are of most transcendent magnanimity.

The Greeks have taken for their heroes only royal persons; and
so also for the most part have the moderns. Certainly not because
the rank gives more worth to him who is acting or suffering; and
since the whole thing is just to set human passions in play, the
relative value of the objects by which this happens is indifferent,
and peasant huts achieve as much as kingdoms. Moreover, civic tragedy is by no means to be unconditionally rejected. Persons
of great power and consideration are yet the best adapted for
tragedy on this account, that the misfortune in which we ought to
recognise the fate of humanity must have a sufficient magnitude
to appear terrible to the spectator, whoever he may be. Euripides[218]
himself says, “∆μ≈, ∆μ≈, ƒ± ºμ≥±ª±, ºμ≥±ª± ∫±π ¿±√«μπ ∫±∫±”
(Stob. Flor., vol. ii. p. 299). Now the circumstances which
plunge a citizen family into want and despair are in the eyes of
the great or rich, for the most part, very insignificant, and capable
of being removed by human assistance, nay, sometimes even by
a trifle: such spectators, therefore, cannot be tragically affected
by them. On the other hand, the misfortunes of the great and
powerful are unconditionally terrible, and also accessible to no
help from without; for kings must help themselves by their own
power, or fall. To this we have to add that the fall is greatest
from a height. Accordingly persons of the rank of citizens lack
height to fall from.

If now we have found the tendency and ultimate intention
of tragedy to be a turning to resignation, to the denial of the
will to live, we shall easily recognise in its opposite, comedy,
the incitement to the continued assertion of the will. It is true
the comedy, like every representation of human life, without
exception, must bring before our eyes suffering and adversity;
but it presents it to us as passing, resolving itself into joy, in gen-
eral mingled with success, victory, and hopes, which in the end
preponderate; moreover, it brings out the inexhaustible material
for laughter of which life, and even its adversities themselves are
filled, and which under all circumstances ought to keep us in a
good humour. 

Thus it declares, in the result, that life as a whole
is thoroughly good, and especially is always amusing. Certainly
it must hasten to drop the curtain at the moment of joy, so that
we may not see what comes after; while the tragedy, as a rule,
so ends that nothing can come after. And moreover, if once we
contemplate this burlesque side of life somewhat seriously, as it shows itself in the naïve utterances and gestures which trifling embarrassment, personal fear, momentary anger, secret envy,
and many similar emotions force upon the forms of the real life
that mirrors itself here, forms which deviate considerably from [219]
the type of beauty, then from this side also, thus in an unexpected
manner, the reflective spectator may become convinced that the
existence and action of such beings cannot itself be an end; that,
on the contrary, they can only have attained to existence by an
error, and that what so exhibits itself is something which had
better not be.
