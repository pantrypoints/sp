<!-- The supplements to this fourth book would be very considerable
if it were not that two of its principal subjects which stand
specially in need of being supplemented— -->


Two Scandinavian Academies have asked prize questions on:

- the freedom of the will
- the foundation of ethics

I have answered this in 1841 in my “The 2 Fundamental Problems of Ethics.”

I assume an acquaintance on the part of my readers with the work which has just
been mentioned, just as unconditionally as in the supplements to
the second book I have assumed it with regard to the work “On
the Will in Nature.” 

In general I make the demand that whoever
wishes to make himself acquainted with my philosophy shall read
every line of me. For I am no voluminous writer, no fabricator
of compendiums, no earner of pecuniary rewards, not one whose
writings aim at the approbation of a minister; in a word, not one
whose pen is under the influence of personal ends. I strive after
nothing but the truth, and write as the ancients wrote, with the
sole intention of preserving my thoughts, so that they may be
for the benefit of those who understand how to meditate upon
them and prize them. Therefore I have written little, but that [248]
little with reflection and at long intervals, and accordingly I have
also confined within the smallest possible limits those repetitions
which in philosophical works are sometimes unavoidable on
account of the connection, and from which no single philosopher
is free; so that by far the most of what I have to say is only to
be found in one place. On this account, then, whoever wishes to
learn from me and understand me must leave nothing unread that
I have written. Yet one can judge me and criticise me without
this, as experience has shown; and to this also I further wish
much pleasure.

Meanwhile the space gained by the said elimination of two
important subjects will be very welcome to us. For since those
explanations, which every man has more at heart than anything
else, and which therefore in every system, as ultimate results,
form the apex of its pyramid, are also crowded together in my
last book, a larger space will gladly be granted to every firmer
proof or more accurate account of these. Besides this we have
been able to discuss here, as belonging to the doctrine of the
“assertion of the will to live,” a question which in our fourth
book itself remained untouched, as it was also entirely neglected
by all philosophers before me: it is the inner significance and real
nature of the sexual love, which sometimes rises to a vehement
passion—a subject which it would not have been paradoxical to
take up in the ethical part of philosophy if its importance had
been known.
