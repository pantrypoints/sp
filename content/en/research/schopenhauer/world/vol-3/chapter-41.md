This chapter is connected with § 54 of the first volume.

Death is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy.

Socrates has defined the latter as ....

Without death, men would scarcely philosophise. 

This is why I put the topic of death at the beginning of the last, most serious, and most important of our books.

The brute lives without a proper knowledge of death; therefore the individual brute enjoys directly the absolute imperishableness of the species, for it is only conscious of itself as endless. In the case of men the terrifying certainty of death necessarily entered with reason. But as everywhere in nature with every evil a means of cure, or at least some compensation, is given, the same reflec- tion which introduces the knowledge of death also assists us to metaphysical points of view, which comfort us concerning it, and of which the brute has no need and is incapable. All religious and philosophical systems are principally directed to this end, and are thus primarily the antidote to the certainty of death, which the reflective reason produces out of its own means. Yet the degree in which they attain this end is very different, and certainly one religion or philosophy will, far more than the others, enable men to look death in the face with a quiet glance. Brahmanism and [250] Buddhism, which teach man to regard himself as himself, the original being, the Brahm, to which all coming into being and passing away is essentially foreign, will achieve much more in this respect than such as teach that man is made out of nothing, and actually begins at birth his existence derived from another.

Answering to this we find in India a confidence and a contempt for death of which one has no conception in Europe. 

It is, in fact, a hazardous thing to force upon a man, by early imprinting them, weak and untenable conceptions in this important regard, and thereby making him for ever incapable of taking up correct
and stable ones. For example, to teach him that he recently came
out of nothing, and consequently through an eternity has been
nothing, but yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the
same as to teach him that although he is through and through
the work of another, yet he will be held responsible through
all eternity for his actions.

If, then, when the mind ripens and
reflection appears, the untenable nature of such doctrines forces
itself upon him, he has nothing better to put in its place, nay,
is no longer capable of understanding anything better, and thus
loses the comfort which nature had destined for him also, as a
compensation for the certainty of death. In consequence of such
a process, we see even now in England (1844), among ruined
factory hands, the Socialists, and in Germany, among ruined
students, the young Hegelians, sink to the absolutely physical
point of view, which leads to the result: edite, bibite, post mortem
nulla voluptas, and so far may be defined as bestialism.

However, after all that has been taught concerning death, it
cannot be denied that, at least in Europe, the opinion of men,
nay, often even of the same individual, very frequently vacillates
between the conception of death as absolute annihilation and the
assumption that we are, as it were, with skin and hair, immortal.
Both are equally false: but we have not so much to find a correct
mean as rather to gain the higher point of view from which such[251]
notions disappear of themselves.

In these considerations I shall first of all start from the purely
empirical standpoint. Here there primarily lies before us the
undeniable fact that, according to the natural consciousness, man
not only fears death for his own person more than anything else,
but also weeps violently over the death of those that belong to
him, and indeed clearly not egotistically, for his own loss, but out of sympathy for the great misfortune that has befallen them.

Therefore he also censures those who in such a case neither weep
nor show sadness as hard-hearted and unloving. It is parallel
with this that revenge, in its highest degree, seeks the death of
the adversary as the greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions
change with time and place; but the voice of nature remains
always and everywhere the same, and is therefore to be heeded
before everything else. Now here it seems distinctly to say that
death is a great evil. In the language of nature death means
annihilation. And that death is a serious matter may be concluded
from the fact that, as every one knows, life is no joke. We must
indeed deserve nothing better than these two.

The fear of death is independent of all knowledge; for
the brute has it, although it does not know death. Everything that
is born brings it with it into the world. But this fear of death is
a priori only the reverse side of the will to live, which indeed
we all are. Therefore in every brute the fear of its destruction
is inborn, like the care for its maintenance. Thus it is the fear
of death, and not the mere avoidance of pain, which shows
itself in the anxious carefulness with which the brute seeks to
protect itself, and still more its brood, from everything that might
become dangerous. Why does the brute flee, trembling, and seek
to conceal itself? Because it is simply the will to live, but, as
such, is forfeited to death, and wishes to gain time. 

Such also, by nature, is man. The greatest evil, the worst that can anywhere [252]
threaten, is death; the greatest fear is the fear of death. Nothing
excites us so irresistibly to the most lively interest as danger to
the life of others; nothing is so shocking as an execution. Now
the boundless attachment to life which appears here cannot have
sprung from knowledge and reflection; to these it rather appears
foolish, for the objective worth of life is very uncertain, and at
least it remains doubtful whether it is preferable to not being,
nay, if experience and reflection come to be expressed, not being
must certainly win. If one knocked on the graves, and asked the dead whether they wished to rise again, they would shake their
heads. 

Such is the opinion of Socrates in “Plato's Apology,” and
even the gay and amiable Voltaire cannot help saying, “On aime
la vie; mais le néant ne laisse pas d'avoir du bon;” and again,
“Je ne sais pas ce que c'est que la vie éternelle, mais celle-ci
est une mauvaise plaisanterie.” Besides, life must in any case
soon end; so that the few years which perhaps one has yet to
be vanish entirely before the endless time when one will be no
more. Accordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be
so anxious about this span of time, to tremble so much if our
own life or that of another is in danger, and to compose tragedies
the horror of which has its strength in the fear of death. That
powerful attachment to life is therefore irrational and blind; it
can only be explained from the fact that our whole inner nature
is itself will to live, to which, therefore, life must appear as
the highest good, however embittered, short, and uncertain it
may always be; and that that will, in itself and originally, is
unconscious and blind. 

Knowledge, on the contrary, far from being the source of that attachment to life, even works against
it, for it discloses the worthlessness of life, and thus combats the
fear of death. When it conquers, and accordingly the man faces
death courageously and composedly, this is honoured as great
and noble, thus we hail then the triumph of knowledge over the
blind will to live, which is yet the kernel of our own being. 

In the same way we despise him in whom knowledge is defeated in that conflict, and who therefore clings unconditionally to life, struggles to the utmost against approaching death, and receives
it with despair.

And yet in him it is only the most original being of ourselves and of nature that expresses itself. We may
here ask, in passing, how could this boundless love of life and
endeavour to maintain it in every way as long as possible be regarded as base, contemptible, and by the adherents of every
religion as unworthy of this, if it were the gift of good gods, to be
recognised with thankfulness? 

How could it then seem great and noble to esteem it lightly? 
Meanwhile, what is confirmed by these considerations is:

1. The will to live is the inmost nature of man
2. In itself it is unconscious and blind
3. Knowledge is an adventitious principle, which is originally foreign to the will
4. Knowledge conflicts with the will, and that our judgment applauds the victory of knowledge over the will.

If what makes death seem so terrible to us were the thought of
not being, we would necessarily think with equal horror of the
time when as yet we were not. For it is irrefutably certain that
not being after death cannot be different from not being before
birth, and consequently is also no more deplorable.
