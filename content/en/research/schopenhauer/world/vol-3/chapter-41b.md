A whole eternity has run its course while as yet we were not, but that
by no means disturbs us. 

On the other hand, we find it hard,
nay, unendurable, that after the momentary intermezzo of an
ephemeral existence, a second eternity should follow in which
we shall no longer be. 

Should, then, this thirst for existence
have arisen because we have now tasted it and have found it so
delightful? As was already briefly explained above, certainly
not; far sooner could the experience gained have awakened an [254]
infinite longing for the lost paradise of non-existence. To the
hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always added
that of a “better world”—a sign that the present world is not
much good. Notwithstanding all this, the question as to our state
after death has certainly been discussed, in books and verbally,
ten thousand times oftener than the question as to our state before
birth. Yet theoretically the one is just as near at hand and as
fair a problem as the other; and besides, whoever had answered
the one would soon see to the bottom of the other. 

We have fine declamations about how shocking it would be to think that
the mind of man, which embraces the world, and has so many very excellent thoughts, should sink with him into the grave;
but we hear nothing about this mind having allowed a whole
eternity to pass before it came into being with these its qualities,
and how the world must have had to do without it all that time.

Yet no question presents itself more naturally to knowledge,
uncorrupted by the will, than this: An infinite time has passed
before my birth; what was I during this time? Metaphysically,
it might perhaps be answered, “I was always I; that is, all who
during that time said I, were just I.” But let us look away from
this to our present entirely empirical point of view, and assume
that I did not exist at all. Then I can console myself as to the
infinite time after my death, when I shall not be, with the infinite
time when I already was not, as a well-accustomed, and indeed
very comfortable, state. For the eternity a parte post without me
can be just as little fearful as the eternity a parte ante without
me, since the two are distinguished by nothing except by the
interposition of an ephemeral dream of life. All proofs, also, for
continued existence after death may just as well be applied in
partem ante, where they then demonstrate existence before life,
in the assumption of which the Hindus and Buddhists therefore
show themselves very consistent. Kant's ideality of time alone[255]
solves all these riddles. But we are not speaking of that now.

This, however, results from what has been said, that to mourn for the time when one will be no more is just as absurd as it would be to mourn over the time when as yet one was not; for it is all
the same whether the time which our existence does not fill is
related to that which it does fill, as future or as past.

But, also, regarded entirely apart from these temporal considerations, it is in and for itself absurd to look upon not being as an evil; for every evil, as every good, presupposes existence,
nay, even consciousness: but the latter ceases with life, as also in
sleep and in a swoon; therefore the absence of it is well known
to us, and trusted, as containing no evil at all: its entrance, how-
ever, is always an affair of a moment. 

From this point of view Epicurus considered death, and therefore quite rightly said, “A
∏±Ω±ƒø¬ º∑¥μΩ ¿¡ø¬ !º±¬” (Death does not concern us); with the
explanation that when we are death is not, and when death is we
are not (Diog. Laert., x. 27). To have lost what cannot be missed
is clearly no evil. Therefore ceasing to be ought to disturb us
as little as not having been. Accordingly from the standpoint of
knowledge there appears absolutely no reason to fear death. 

But consciousness consists in knowing; therefore, for consciousness death is no evil. Moreover, it is really not this knowing part of
our ego that fears death, but the fuga mortis proceeds entirely and
alone from the blind will, of which everything living is filled. To
this, however, as was already mentioned above, it is essential,
just because it is will to live, whose whole nature consists in
the effort after life and existence, and which is not originally
endowed with knowledge, but only in consequence of its objec-
tification in animal individuals. If now the will, by means of
knowledge, beholds death as the end of the phenomenon with
which it has identified itself, and to which, therefore, it sees itself
limited, its whole nature struggles against it with all its might.
Whether now it has really something to fear from death we will [256]
investigate further on, and will then remember the real source
of the fear of death, which has been shown here along with the
requisite distinction of the willing and the knowing part of our
nature.

Corresponding to this, then, what makes death so terrible to
us is not so much the end of life—for this can appear to no
one specially worthy of regret—but rather the destruction of the
organism; really because this is the will itself exhibiting itself
as body. But we only really feel this destruction in the evils of
disease or of old age; death itself, on the other hand, consists
for the subject only in the moment when consciousness vanishes
because the activity of the brain ceases. The extension of the
stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which follows
this is really already an event after death. 

Thus death, in a subjective regard, concerns the consciousness alone. Now what the
vanishing of this may be every one can to a certain extent judge
of from going to sleep; but it is still better known to whoever
has really fainted, for in this the transition is not so gradual, nor
accompanied by dreams, but first the power of sight leaves us,
still fully conscious, and then immediately the most profound
unconsciousness enters; the sensation that accompanies it, so far
as it goes, is anything but disagreeable; and without doubt, as
sleep is the brother of death, so the swoon is its twin-brother.
Even violent death cannot be painful, for even severe wounds are
not felt at all till some time afterwards, often not till the outward
signs of them are observed. If they are rapidly mortal, conscious-
ness will vanish before this discovery; if they result in death later,
then it is the same as with other illnesses. All those also who have
lost consciousness in water, or from charcoal fumes, or through
hanging are well known to say that it happened without pain.

Now, finally, the death which is properly in accordance with
nature, death from old age, euthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and
sinking out of existence in an imperceptible manner. Little by[257]
little in old age, the passions and desires, with the susceptibility
for their objects, are extinguished; the emotions no longer find
anything to excite them; for the power of presenting ideas to the
mind always becomes weaker, its images fainter; the impressions
no longer cleave to us, but pass over without leaving a trace, the
days roll ever faster, events lose their significance, everything
grows pale. The old man stricken in years totters about or rests
in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost of his former self. What
remains there for death to destroy? One day a sleep is his last,
and his dreams are ——. They are the dreams which Hamlet
inquires after in the famous soliloquy. I believe we dream them
even now.
I have here also to remark that the maintenance of the life
process, although it has a metaphysical basis, does not go on
without resistance, and consequently not without effort. It is this to which the organism yields every night, on account of which it then suspends the brain function and diminishes certain secretions, the respiration, the pulse, and the development of heat. 

From this we may conclude that the entire ceasing of the life
process must be a wonderful relief to its motive force; perhaps
this has some share in the expression of sweet contentment on
the faces of most dead persons. In general the moment of death
may be like the moment of awaking from a heavy dream that has
oppressed us like a nightmare.

Up to this point the result we have arrived at is that death, however much it may be feared, can yet really be no evil. But
often it even appears as a good thing, as something wished for,
as a friend. All that have met with insuperable obstacles to their
existence or their efforts, that suffer from incurable diseases or
inconsolable griefs, have as a last refuge, which generally opens
to them of its own accord, the return into the womb of nature,
from which they arose for a short time, enticed by the hope of
more favourable conditions of existence than have fallen to their lot, and the same path out of which constantly remains open. 

That return is the cessio bonorum of life. Yet even here it is only
entered upon after a physical and moral conflict: so hard does
one struggle against returning to the place from which one came
out so lightly and readily, to an existence which has so much
suffering and so little pleasure to offer. The Hindus give the god
of death, Yama, two faces; one very fearful and terrible, and one
very cheerful and benevolent. This partly explains itself from the
reflections we have just made.
