<!-- At the empirical point of view at which we still stand, the
following consideration is one which presents itself of its own
accord, and therefore deserves to be accurately defined by illustration, and thereby referred to its proper limits.  -->

The sight of a dead body shows me that sensibility, irritability, circulation of the blood, reproduction, &c., have here ceased. 

I conclude from this with certainty that what actuated these hitherto, which was yet always something unknown to me, now actuates them no longer, thus has departed from them. But if I should now wish
to add that this must have been just what I have known only as consciousness, consequently as intelligence (soul), this would be not only an unjustified but clearly a false conclusion. 

For consciousness has always showed itself to me not as the cause, but as the product and result of the organised life, for it rose and sank in consequence of this in the different periods of life, in health and sickness, in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &c., thus always appeared as effect, never as cause of the organised life, always showed itself as something which arises and passes away, and again arises, so long as the conditions of this still exist, but not apart from them. 

Nay, I may also have seen that the complete derangement of consciousness, madness, far from dragging down with it and depressing the other forces, or indeed endangering life, heightens these very much, especially irritability or muscular force, and rather lengthens than shortens life, if other causes do not come in. 

Then, also: I knew individuality as a quality of everything organised, and therefore, if this is a
self-conscious organism, also of consciousness. But there exists
no occasion now to conclude that individuality was inherent in
that vanished principle, which imparts life, and is completely
unknown to me; all the less so as I see that everywhere in nature
each particular phenomenon is the work of a general force which
is active in thousands of similar phenomena. 

But, on the other hand, there is just as little occasion to conclude that because the
organised life has ceased here that force which hitherto actuated
it has also become nothing; as little as to infer the death of the
spinner from the stopping of the spinning-wheel. If a pendulum,
by finding its centre of gravity, at last comes to rest, and thus
its individual apparent life has ceased, no one will imagine that
gravitation is now annihilated; but every one comprehends that,
after as before, it is active in innumerable phenomena. 

Certainly it might be urged against this comparison, that here also, in this pendulum, gravitation has not ceased to be active, but only to manifest its activity palpably; whoever insists on this may think,
instead, of an electrical body, in which, after its discharge, electricity has actually ceased to be active. I only wished to show in this that we ourselves recognise in the lowest forces of nature an
eternity and ubiquity with regard to which the transitory nature
of their fleeting phenomena never makes us err for a moment.

So much the less, then, should it come into our mind to regard the ceasing of life as the annihilation of the living principle, and consequently death as the entire destruction of the man. Because
the strong arm which, three thousand years ago, bent the bow of Ulysses is no more, no reflective and well-regulated understanding will regard the force which acted so energetically in it as entirely annihilated, and therefore, upon further reflection, will also not assume that the force which bends the bow to-day first
began with this arm. 

The thought lies far nearer us, that the force which earlier actuated the life which now has vanished is the same which is active in the life which now flourishes: nay, this is almost inevitable. Certainly, however, we know that, as
was explained in the second book, only that is perishable which
is involved in the causal series; but only the states and forms
are so involved. On the other hand, untouched by the change
of these which is introduced by causes, there remain on the one
side matter, and on the other side natural forces: for both are the
presupposition of all these changes. 

But the principle of our life we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force of nature, until
perhaps a more profound investigation has brought us to know
what it is in itself. Thus, taken simply as a force of nature, the
vital force remains entirely undisturbed by the change of forms
and states, which the bond of cause and effect introduces and
carries off again, and which alone are subject to the process
of coming into being and passing away, as it lies before us
in experience. Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true
being can be proved with certainty. 

But it is true this will not satisfy the claims which are wont to be made upon proofs of our
continued existence after death, nor insure the consolation which
is expected from such proofs. However, it is always something;
and whoever fears death as an absolute annihilation cannot afford
to despise the perfect certainty that the inmost principle of his
life remains untouched by it. Nay, the paradox might be set up,
that that second thing also which, just like the forces of nature,
remains untouched by the continual change under the guidance
of causality, thus matter, by its absolute permanence, insures us
indestructibility, by virtue of which whoever was incapable of
comprehending any other might yet confidently trust in a certain
imperishableness. “What!” it will be said, “the permanence of the
mere dust, of the crude matter, is to be regarded as a continuance
of our being?” Oh! do you know this dust, then? 

Do you know what it is and what it can do? Learn to know it before
you despise it. This matter which now lies there as dust and
ashes will soon, dissolved in water, form itself as a crystal, will
shine as metal, will then emit electric sparks, will by means of
its galvanic intensity manifest a force which, decomposing the
closest combinations, reduces earths to metals; nay, it will, of
its own accord, form itself into plants and animals, and from its
mysterious womb develop that life for the loss of which you, in
your narrowness, are so painfully anxious. Is it, then, absolutely
nothing to continue to exist as such matter? Nay, I seriously
assert that even this permanence of matter affords evidence of the
indestructibility of our true nature, though only as in an image or
simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see this we only need to
call to mind the explanation of matter given in chapter 24, from
which it resulted that mere formless matter—this basis of the
world of experience which is never perceived for itself alone, but
assumed as constantly remaining—is the immediate reflection,
the visibility in general, of the thing in itself, thus of the will.

Therefore, whatever absolutely pertains to the will as such holds
good also of matter, and it reflects the true eternal nature of the will under the image of temporal imperishableness. 

Nature does not lie idle. And so no view which has sprung from a purely objective comprehension of it, and been logically
thought out, can be absolutely false, but at the most only very
one-sided and imperfect. Such, however, is, indisputably, con-
sistent materialism; for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as
the absolute idealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in
general every philosophical point of view which has proceeded
from a correct apperçu, and been honestly carried out. Only they
are all exceedingly one-sided comprehensions, and therefore, in
spite of their opposition, they are all true, each from a definite
point of view; but as soon as one has risen above this point of
view, then they only appear as relatively and conditionally true. [262]
The highest standpoint alone, from which one surveys them all
and knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, in
their falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this is in
general attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown above,
that in the very crude, and therefore very old, point of view of
materialism proper the indestructibility of our true nature in itself
is represented, as by a mere shadow of it, the imperishableness of
matter; as in the already higher naturalism of an absolute physics
it is represented by the ubiquity and eternity of the natural forces,
among which the vital force is at least to be counted. Thus
even these crude points of view contain the assertion that the
living being suffers no absolute annihilation through death, but
continues to exist in and with the whole of nature.

The considerations which have brought us to this point, and to which the further explanations link themselves on, started from the remarkable fear of death which fills all living beings. 

But now we will change the standpoint and consider how, in contrast to the individual beings, the whole of nature bears itself with reference to death. In doing this, however, we still always remain upon the ground of experience.
