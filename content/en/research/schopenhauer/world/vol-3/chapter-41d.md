The highest game of chance is that for death and life.

Every decision about this we watch with the utmost excitement, interest, and fear; for in our eyes all in all
is at stake. On the other hand, nature, which never lies, but is
always straightforward and open, speaks quite differently upon
this theme, speaks like Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. 

What it says is: The death or the life of the individual is of no signif-
icance. It expresses this by the fact that it exposes the life of
every brute, and even of man, to the most insignificant accidents
without coming to the rescue. 

Consider the insect on your path; a slight, unconscious turning of your step is decisive as to its
life or death. Look at the wood-snail, without any means of
flight, of defence, of deception, of concealment, a ready prey[263]
for all. Look at the fish carelessly playing in the still open net;
the frog restrained by its laziness from the flight which might
save it; the bird that does not know of the falcon that soars
above it; the sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from
the thicket. All these, provided with little foresight, go about
guilelessly among the dangers that threaten their existence every
moment. 

Since now nature exposes its organisms, constructed
with such inimitable skill, not only to the predatory instincts of
the stronger, but also to the blindest chance, to the humour of
every fool, the mischievousness of every child without reserve,
it declares that the annihilation of these individuals is indifferent
to it, does it no harm, has no significance, and that in these cases
the effect is of no more importance than the cause. 

It says this
very distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no comments
on its utterances, but rather expresses them in the laconic style
of an oracle. If now the all-mother sends forth her children
without protection to a thousand threatening dangers, this can
only be because she knows that if they fall they fall back into
her womb, where they are safe; therefore their fall is a mere jest.
Nature does not act otherwise with man than with the brutes.
Therefore its declaration extends also to man: the life and death
of the individual are indifferent to it. 

Accordingly, in a certain sense, they ought also to be indifferent to us, for we ourselves are
indeed nature. Certainly, if only we saw deep enough, we would
agree with nature, and regard life and death as indifferently as it
does. Meanwhile, by means of reflection, we must attribute that
carelessness and indifference of nature towards the life of the
individuals to the fact that the destruction of such a phenomenon
does not in the least affect its true and proper nature.

If we further ponder the fact, that not only, as we have just
seen, are life and death dependent upon the most trifling accidents, but that the existence of the organised being in general is an ephemeral one, that animal and plant arise to-day and pass away to-morrow, and birth and death follow in quick succession, while to the unorganised things which stand so much lower an
incomparably longer duration is assured, and an infinite duration
to the absolutely formless matter alone, to which, indeed, we
attribute this a priori,—then, I think, the thought must follow of
its own accord, even from the purely empirical, but objective and
unprejudiced comprehension of such an order of things, that this
is only a superficial phenomenon, that such a constant arising
and passing away can by no means touch the root of things, but
can only be relative, nay, only apparent, in which the true inner
nature of that thing is not included, the nature which everywhere
evades our glance and is thoroughly mysterious, but rather that
this continues to exist undisturbed by it; although we can neither
apprehend nor conceive the manner in which this happens, and
must therefore think of it only generally as a kind of tour de
passe-passe which took place there. 

For that, while what is most
imperfect, the lowest, the unorganised, continues to exist unas-
sailed, it is just the most perfect beings, the living creatures, with
their infinitely complicated and inconceivably ingenious organ-
isations, which constantly arise, new from the very foundation,
and after a brief span of time absolutely pass into nothingness, to
make room for other new ones like them coming into existence
out of nothing—this is something so obviously absurd that it can never be the true order of things, but rather a mere veil which conceals this, or, more accurately, a phenomenon conditioned
by the nature of our intellect. Nay, the whole being and not
being itself of these individuals, in relation to which death and
life are opposites, can only be relative. 

Thus the language of nature, in which it is given us as absolute, cannot be the true and
ultimate expression of the nature of things and of the order of the
world, but indeed only a patois du pays, i.e., something merely
relatively true,—something to be understood cum grano salis, or, to speak properly, something conditioned by our intellect; I say, an immediate, intuitive conviction of the kind which I have
tried to describe in words will press itself upon every one; i.e.,
certainly only upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly
ordinary species, which is absolutely only capable of knowing
the particular simply and solely as such, which is strictly limited
to the knowledge of individuals, after the manner of the intellect
of the brutes. Whoever, on the other hand, by means of a capacity
of an only somewhat higher power, even just begins to see in
the individual beings their universal, their Ideas, will also, to
a certain extent, participate in that conviction, and that indeed
as an immediate, and therefore certain, conviction. In fact, it
is also only small, limited minds that fear death quite seriously
as their annihilation, and persons of decidedly superior capacity
are completely free from such terrors.

Plato rightly bases the whole of philosophy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas,
i.e., upon the perception of the universal in the particular. But
the conviction here described, which proceeds directly from the
comprehension of nature, must have been exceedingly vivid in
those sublime authors of the Upanishads of the Vedas, who can
scarcely be thought of as mere men, for it speaks to us so forcibly
out of an innumerable number of their utterances that we must
ascribe this immediate illumination of their mind to the fact that
these wise men, standing nearer the origin of our race in time,
comprehended the nature of things more clearly and profoundly than the already deteriorated race, Aπøπ Ω≈Ω ≤¡øƒøπ μπ√πΩ, is able to do. 

But certainly their comprehension is assisted by the natural
world of India, which is endowed with life in a very different
degree from our northern world. However, thorough reflection,
as pursued by Kant's great mind, leads by another path to the
same result, for it teaches us that our intellect, in which that
phenomenal world which changes so fast exhibits itself, does [266]
not comprehend the true ultimate nature of things, but merely
its phenomenal manifestation, and indeed, as I add, because it is
originally only destined to present the motives to our will, i.e., to
be serviceable to it in the pursuit of its paltry ends.

Let us, however, carry our objective and unprejudiced consideration of nature still further. If I kill a living creature, whether a dog, a bird, a frog, or even only an insect, it is really inconceivable that this being, or rather the original force by virtue of which such a marvellous phenomenon exhibited itself just the moment before, in its full energy and love of life, should have been annihilated by my wicked or thoughtless act. And again,
on the other hand, the millions of animals of every kind which
come into existence every moment, in infinite variety, full of
force and activity, can never, before the act of their generation,
have been nothing at all, and have attained from nothing to an absolute beginning. If now in this way I see one of these
withdraw itself from my sight, without me knowing where it goes, and another appear without me knowing whence it comes;
if, moreover, both have the same form, the same nature, the same
character, and only not the same matter, which yet during their
existence they continually throw off and renew; then certainly
the assumption, that that which vanishes and that which appears
in its place are one and the same, which has only experienced
a slight alteration, a renewal of the form of its existence, and
that consequently death is for the species what sleep is for the
individual; this assumption, I say, lies so close at hand that it
is impossible not to light upon it, unless the mind, perverted in early youth by the imprinting of false views, hurries it out
of the way, even from a distance, with superstitious fear. 

But the opposite assumption that the birth of an animal is an arising out of nothing, and accordingly that its death is its absolute annihilation, and this with the further addition that man, who has also originated out of nothing, has yet an individual, endless existence, and indeed a conscious existence, while the dog, the ape, the elephant, are annihilated by death, is really something against which the healthy mind revolts and which it must regard as absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the comparison of the results of a system with the utterances of the healthy mind is supposed to be a touchstone of its truth, I wish the adherents of the system which was handed down from Descartes to the pre-Kantian eclectics, nay, which even now is still the prevailing view of the great majority of cultured people in Europe, would apply this touchstone here.
