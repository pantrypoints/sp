Throughout and everywhere the true symbol of nature is the circle, because it is the schema or type of recurrence. This is, in fact, the most universal form in nature, which it carries out in everything, from the course of the stars down to the death and the genesis of organised beings, and by which alone, in the ceaseless stream of time, and its content, a permanent existence, i.e., a nature, becomes possible.

If in autumn we consider the little world of insects, and see how one prepares its bed to sleep the long, rigid winter-sleep; another spins its cocoon to pass the winter as a chrysalis, and awake in spring rejuvenated and perfected; and, finally, how most of them, intending themselves to rest in the arms of death, merely arrange with care the suitable place for their egg, in order to issue forth again from it some day renewed;—this is nature's great doctrine of immortality, which seeks to teach us that there is no radical difference between sleep and death, but the one endangers existence just as little as the other.

The care with which the insect prepares a cell, or hole, or nest, deposits its egg in it, together with food for the larva that will come out of it in the following spring, and then quietly dies, is just like the care
with which in the evening a man lays ready his clothes and his
breakfast for the next morning, and then quietly goes to sleep;
and at bottom it could not take place at all if it were not that the [268]
insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and according to its true
nature, just as much identical with the one which is hatched out
in the spring as the man who lies down to sleep is identical with
the man who rises from it.

If now, after these considerations, we return to ourselves and
our own species, then cast our glance forward far into the future,
and seek to present to our minds the future generations, with the
millions of their individuals in the strange form of their customs
and pursuits, and then interpose with the question: Whence will
all these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile womb
of that nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still conceals the
coming races? 

Would not the smiling and true answer to this be, Where else should they be than there where alone the real
always was and will be, in the present and its content?—thus
with thee, the foolish questioner, who in this mistaking of his
own nature is like the leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn
and about to fall, complains at its destruction, and will not be
consoled by looking forward to the fresh green which will clothe
the tree in spring, but says lamenting, “I am not these! These are
quite different leaves!” Oh, foolish leaf! Whither wilt thou? And
whence should others come? Where is the nothing whose abyss
thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so filled
with thirst for existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious,
germinating force of the tree, which, constantly one and the same
in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by all arising and
passing away. And now, ø1∑ ¿μ¡ ∆≈ªª…Ω ≥μΩμ∑, ƒøπ∑¥μ ∫±π

Whether
the fly which now buzzes round me goes to sleep in the evening,
and buzzes again tomorrow, or dies in the evening, and in spring another fly buzzes which has sprung from its egg: that is in itself
the same thing; but therefore the knowledge which exhibits this
as two fundamentally different things is not unconditioned, but[269]
relative, a knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the thing in
itself. In the morning the fly exists again; it also exists again in
the spring. What distinguishes for it the winter from the night? In
Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. § 275, we read, “Till ten o'clock
in the morning no Cercaria ephemera (one of the infusoria) is to
be seen (in the infusion), and at twelve the whole water swarms
with them. In the evening they die, and the next morning they
again appear anew.” So it was observed by Nitzsch six days
running.

So everything lingers but a moment, and hastens on to death.
The plant and the insect die at the end of the summer, the brute
and the man after a few years: death reaps unweariedly. Yet
notwithstanding this, nay, as if this were not so at all, every-
thing is always there and in its place, just as if everything were
imperishable. The plant always thrives and blooms, the insect
hums, the brute and the man exist in unwasted youth, and the
cherries that have already been enjoyed a thousand times we
have again before us every summer. The nations also exist as
immortal individuals, although sometimes their names change;
even their action, what they do and suffer, is always the same;
although history always pretends to relate something different:
for it is like the kaleidoscope, which at every turn shows a new
figure, while we really always have the same thing before our
eyes. What then presses itself more irresistibly upon us than the
thought that that arising and passing away does not concern the
real nature of things, but this remains untouched by it, thus is im-
perishable, and therefore all and each that wills to exist actually
exists continuously and without end. Accordingly at every given
point of time all species of animals, from the gnat to the elephant,
exist together complete. They have already renewed themselves
many thousand times, and withal have remained the same. 

They know nothing of others like them, who have lived before them, [270]
or will live after them; it is the species which always lives, and
in the consciousness of the imperishable nature of the species
and their identity with it the individuals cheerfully exist. The
will to live manifests itself in an endless present, because this is
the form of the life of the species, which, therefore, never grows
old, but remains always young. Death is for it what sleep is for
the individual, or what winking is for the eye, by the absence of
which the Indian gods are known, if they appear in human form.
As through the entrance of night the world vanishes, but yet does
not for a moment cease to exist, so man and brute apparently
pass away through death, and yet their true nature continues, just
as undisturbed by it. Let us now think of that alternation of death
and birth as infinitely rapid vibrations, and we have before us
the enduring objectification of the will, the permanent Ideas of
being, fixed like the rainbow on the waterfall. This is temporal
immortality. In consequence of this, notwithstanding thousands
of years of death and decay, nothing has been lost, not an atom
of the matter, still less anything of the inner being, that exhibits
itself as nature. Therefore every moment we can cheerfully cry,
“In spite of time, death, and decay, we are still all together!”
Perhaps we would have to except whoever had once said from
the bottom of his heart, with regard to this game, “I want no
more.” But this is not yet the place to speak of this.
But we have certainly to draw attention to the fact that the
pain of birth and the bitterness of death are the two constant
conditions under which the will to live maintains itself in its
objectification, i.e., our inner nature, untouched by the course
of time and the death of races, exists in an everlasting present,
and enjoys the fruit of the assertion of the will to live. This is
analogous to the fact that we can only be awake during the day
on condition that we sleep during the night; indeed the latter is
the commentary which nature offers us for the understanding of [271]
264 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
that difficult passage.29
For the substratum, or the content, ¿ª∑¡…º±, or the material of
the present, is through all time really the same. The impossibility
of knowing this identity directly is just time, a form and limitation
of our intellect. That on account of it, for example, the future
event is not yet, depends upon an illusion of which we become
conscious when that event has come. That the essential form
of our intellect introduces such an illusion explains and justifies
itself from the fact that the intellect has come forth from the
hands of nature by no means for the apprehension of the nature
of things, but merely for the apprehension of motives, thus for
the service of an individual and temporal phenomenon of will.30
Whoever comprehends the reflections which here occupy us
will also understand the true meaning of the paradoxical doctrine
of the Eleatics, that there is no arising and passing away, but the
whole remains immovable: “†±¡ºμΩπ¥∑¬ ∫±π úμªπ√√ø¬ ±Ω√¡ø≈Ω
≥μΩμ√πΩ ∫±π ∆∏ø¡±Ω, ¥π± ƒø ΩøºπæμπΩ ƒø ¿±Ω ±∫πΩ∑ƒøΩ” (Par-
menides et Melissus ortum et interitum tollebant, quoniam nihil
moveri putabant), Stob. Ecl., i. 21. Light is also thrown here
upon the beautiful passage of Empedocles which Plutarch has
preserved for us in the book, “Adversus Coloten,” c. 12:—[272]

<!-- 29 The suspension of the animal functions is sleep, that of the organic functions
is death. -->

30 There is only one present, and this is always: for it is the sole form of actual existence. One must attain to the insight that the past is not in itself different from the present, but only in our apprehension, which has time as its form, on account of which alone the present exhibits itself as different from the past. To assist this insight, imagine all the events and scenes of human life, bad and good, fortunate and unfortunate, pleasing and terrible, as they successively present themselves in the course of time and difference of places, in the most checkered multifariousness and variety, as at once and together, and always present in the Nunc stans, while it is only apparently that now this and now that is; then what the objectification of the will to live really means will be understood. Our pleasure also in genre painting depends principally upon the fact that it fixes the fleeting scenes of life. The dogma of metempsychosis has proceeded from the feeling of the truth which has just been expressed.

The very remarkable and, in its place, astonishing passage in
Diderot's “Jacques le fataliste,” deserves not less to be mentioned
here: 

<!-- “Un château immense, au frontispice duquel on lisait: ‹ Je
n'appartiens à personne, et j'appartiens à tout le monde: vous y
étiez avant que d'y entrer, vous y serez encore, quand vous en
sortirez ›.” -->
