When man is begotten, he arises out of nothing. He becomes nothing through death.

<!-- But really to learn to know this “nothing” would be very interesting; for it only requires moderate acuteness to see that this empirical nothing is by no means absolute, i.e., such as would in every sense be nothing. We are already led to this insight by the observation that all qualities of the parents recur in the children, thus have overcome death. Of this, however, I will speak in a special chapter. -->

There is no greater contrast than that between the ceaseless flight of time, which carries its whole content with it, and the rigid immobility of what is actually present, which at all times is one and the same. 

And if from this point of view we watch in a purely objective manner the immediate events of life, the Nunc stans becomes clear and visible to us in the centre of the wheel of time.

To the eye of a being of incomparably longer life, which at
one glance comprehended the human race in its whole duration,
the constant alternation of birth and death would present itself
as a continuous vibration, and accordingly it would not occur
to it at all to see in this an ever new arising out of nothing and
passing into nothing; but just as to our sight the quickly revolving
spark appears as a continuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring
as a permanent triangle, the vibrating cord as a spindle, so to
this eye the species would appear as that which has being and
permanence, death and life as vibrations.

We will have false conceptions of the indestructibility of our
true nature by death, so long as we do not make up our minds to
study it primarily in the brutes, but claim for ourselves alone a
class apart from them, under the boastful name of immortality.
But it is this pretension alone, and the narrowness of view from
which it proceeds, on account of which most men struggle so
obstinately against the recognition of the obvious truth that we
are essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the brutes;
nay, that they recoil at every hint of our relationship with these.
But it is this denial of the truth which more than anything else
closes against them the path to real knowledge of the indestruc-
tibility of our nature. For if we seek anything upon a wrong
path, we have just on that account forsaken the right path, and
upon the path we follow we will never attain to anything in the
end but late disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not according
to preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of all, learn
to recognise in the aspect of every young animal the existence
of the species that never grows old, which, as a reflection of its
eternal youth, imparts to every individual a temporary youth, and
lets it come forth as new and fresh as if the world were of to-day.
Let one ask himself honestly whether the swallow of this year's
spring is absolutely a different one from the swallow of the first spring, and whether really between the two the miracle of the creation out of nothing has repeated itself millions of times, in
order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation.

I know well that if I seriously assured any one that the cat which
now plays in the yard is still the same one which made the same
springs and played the same tricks there three hundred years ago,
he would think I was mad; but I also know that it is much madder
to believe that the cat of to-day is through and through and in its
whole nature quite a different one from the cat of three hundred
years ago. One only requires truly and seriously to sink oneself
in the contemplation of one of these higher vertebrates in order to
become distinctly conscious that this unfathomable nature, taken
as a whole, as it exists there, cannot possibly become nothing;
and yet, on the other hand, one knows its transitoriness. This
depends upon the fact that in this animal the infinite nature of
its Idea (species) is imprinted in the finiteness of the individual.

For in a certain sense it is of course true that in the individual
we always have before us another being—in the sense which
depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, in which are
also included time and space, which constitute the principium
individuationis. But in another sense it is not true—in the sense
in which reality belongs to the permanent forms of things, the
Ideas alone, and which was so clearly evident to Plato that it
became his fundamental thought, the centre of his philosophy;
and he made the comprehension of it the criterion of capacity for
philosophising in general.

As the scattered drops of the roaring waterfall change with
lightning rapidity, while the rainbow, whose supporter they are,
remains immovably at rest, quite untouched by that ceaseless
change, so every Idea, i.e., every species of living creature re-
mains quite untouched by the continual change of its individuals.
But it is the Idea, or the species in which the will to live is
really rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also the will [275]
is only truly concerned in the continuance of the species. 

For example, the lions which are born and die are like the drops of
the waterfall; but the leonitas, the Idea or form of the lion, is like
the unshaken rainbow upon it. Therefore Plato attributed true
being to the Ideas alone, i.e., to the species; to the individuals
only a ceaseless arising and passing away. From the profound
consciousness of his imperishable nature really springs also the
confidence and peace of mind with which every brute, and even
human individual, moves unconcernedly along amid a host of
chances, which may annihilate it any moment, and, moreover,
moves straight on to death: out of its eyes, however, there shines
the peace of the species, which that death does not affect, and
does not concern. Even to man this peace could not be imparted by uncertain and changing dogmas. But, as was said, the
contemplation of every animal teaches that death is no obstacle
to the kernel of life, to the will in its manifestation. 

What an unfathomable mystery lies, then, in every animal! Look at the
nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully and peacefully he
lives! Many thousands of dogs have had to die before it came to
this one's turn to live. But the death of these thousands has not
affected the Idea of the dog; it has not been in the least disturbed
by all that dying. Therefore the dog exists as fresh and endowed
with primitive force as if this were its first day and none could
ever be its last; and out of its eyes there shines the indestructible
principle in it, the archæus. What, then, has died during those
thousands of years? Not the dog—it stands unscathed before us;
merely its shadow, its image in our form of knowledge, which
is bound to time. Yet how can one even believe that that passes
away which for ever and ever exists and fills all time? Certainly
the matter can be explained empirically; in proportion as death
destroyed the individuals, generation produced new ones. But
this empirical explanation is only an apparent explanation: it
puts one riddle in the place of the other. The metaphysical[276]
understanding of the matter, although not to be got so cheaply, is
yet the only true and satisfying one.

Kant, in his subjective procedure, brought to light the truth
that time cannot belong to the thing in itself, because it lies pre-
formed in our apprehension. Now death is the temporal end of
the temporal phenomenon; but as soon as we abstract time, there
is no longer any end, and this word has lost all significance. But
I, here upon the objective path, am trying to show the positive
side of the matter, that the thing in itself remains untouched by
time, and by that which is only possible through time, arising
and passing away, and that the phenomena in time could not
have even that ceaselessly fleeting existence which stands next
to nothingness, if there were not in them a kernel of the infinite.
Eternity is certainly a conception which has no perception as its
foundation; accordingly it has also a merely negative content; it
signifies a timeless existence. Time is yet merely an image of
eternity, A «¡øΩø¬ μ0∫…Ω ƒøΩ ±0…Ωø¬, as Plotinus has it; and in
the same way our temporal existence is a mere image of our true
nature. This must lie in eternity, just because time is only the
form of our knowledge; but on account of this alone do we know
our own existence, and that of all things as transitory, finite, and
subject to annihilation.

In book 2 I have shown that the adequate objectivity of the will as the thing in itself, at each of its grades, is the
(Platonic) Idea; similarly in the third book that the Ideas of
things have the pure subject of knowledge as their correlative;
consequently the knowledge of them only appears exceptionally
and temporarily under specially favourable conditions. For in-
dividual knowledge, on the other hand, thus in time, the Idea
presents itself under the form of the species, which is the Idea
broken up through its entrance into time. 

Therefore the species is the most immediate objectification of the thing in itself, i.e., [277]
of the will to live. The inmost nature of every brute, and also
of man, accordingly lies in the species; thus the will to live,
which is so powerfully active, is rooted in this, not really in the
individual. 

On the other hand, in the individual alone lies the immediate consciousness: accordingly it imagines itself different from the species, and therefore fears death. The will to live
manifests itself in relation to the individual as hunger and the
fear of death: in relation to the species as sexual instinct and
passionate care for the offspring. In agreement with this we
find nature, which is free from that delusion of the individual,
as careful for the maintenance of the species as it is indifferent
to the destruction of the individuals: the latter are always only
means, the former is the end. Therefore a glaring contrast appears
between its niggardliness in the endowment of the individuals
and its prodigality when the species is concerned. In the latter
case from one individual are often annually obtained a hundred
thousand germs, and more; for example, from trees, fishes, crabs,
termites, and many others. In the former case, on the contrary,
only barely enough in the way of powers and organs is given to
each to enable it with ceaseless effort to maintain its life. And,
therefore, if an animal is injured or weakened it must, as a rule,
starve.

Where an incidental saving was possible, through the circumstance that one part could upon necessity be dispensed
with, it has been withheld, even out of order. Hence, for example,
many caterpillars are without eyes; the poor creatures grope in
the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since they lack feelers, they do
by moving three-fourths of their body back and forward in the air,
till they find some object. Hence they often miss their food which
is to be found close by. But this happens in consequence of the
lex parsimoniæ naturæ, to the expression of which natura nihil
facit supervacaneum one may add et nihil largitur. 

The same tendency of nature shows itself also in the fact that the more fit[278] the individual is, on account of his age, for the propagation of the species, the more powerfully does the vis naturæ medicatrix manifest itself in him, and therefore his wounds heal easily, and he easily recovers from diseases. This diminishes along with the power of generation, and sinks low after it is extinct; for now in the eyes of nature the individual has become worthless.
