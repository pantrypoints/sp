If now we cast another glance at the scale of existences, with the whole of their accompanying gradations of consciousness, from the polyp up to man, we see this wonderful pyramid, kept in ceaseless oscillation certainly by the constant death of the individuals, yet by means of the bond of generation, enduring in the species through the infinite course of time. While, then, as was explained above, the objective, the species, presents itself as indestructible, the subjective, which consists merely in the self-consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the shortest duration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just as often, to come forth again from nothing in an incomprehensible manner.

But one must be very short-sighted to let oneself be deceived by this appearance, and not to comprehend that,
although the form of temporal permanence only belongs to the
objective, the subjective, i.e., the will, which lives and manifests
itself in all, and with it the subject of the knowledge in which
all exhibits itself, must be not less indestructible; because the
permanence of the objective, or external, can yet only be the
phenomenal appearance of the indestructibility of the subjective
or internal; for the former can possess nothing which it has not
received on loan from the latter; and cannot be essentially and
originally an objective, a phenomenon, and then secondarily and
accidentally a subjective, a thing in itself, a self-consciousness.

For clearly the former as a manifestation presupposes something
which manifests itself, as being for other presupposes a being
for self, and as object presupposes a subject; and not conversely:
because everywhere the root of things must lie in that which [279]
they are for themselves, thus in the subjective, not in the ob-
jective, i.e., in that which they are only for others, in a foreign
consciousness. Accordingly we found in the first book that the
right starting-point for philosophy is essentially and necessarily
the subjective, i.e., the idealistic starting-point; and also that the
opposite starting-point, that which proceeds from the objective,
leads to materialism. At bottom, however, we are far more one with the world than we commonly suppose: its inner nature is
our will, its phenomenal appearance is our idea. 

For any one who could bring this unity of being to distinct consciousness, the
difference between the continuance of the external world after
his death and his own continuance after death would vanish. The
two would present themselves to him as one and the same; nay,
he would laugh at the delusion that could separate them. For
the understanding of the indestructibility of our nature coincides
with that of the identity of the macrocosm and the microcosm.
Meanwhile one may obtain light upon what is said here by a
peculiar experiment, performed by means of the imagination, an
experiment which might be called metaphysical. Let any one try
to present vividly to his mind the time, in any case not far distant,
when he will be dead. Then he thinks himself away and lets the
world go on existing; but soon, to his own astonishment, he will
discover that he was nevertheless still there. For he intended to
present the world to his mind without himself; but the ego is the
immediate element in consciousness, through which alone the
world is brought about, and for which alone it exists. 

This centre
of all existence, this kernel of all reality, is to be abolished, and
yet the world is to go on existing; it is a thought which can
be conceived in the abstract, but not realised. The endeavour
to accomplish this, the attempt to think the secondary without
the primary, the conditioned without the condition, that which
is supported without the supporter, always fails, much in the
same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right-angled triangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, and similar
impossibilities. Instead of what was intended, the feeling here
presses upon us that the world is not less in us than we in it,
and that the source of all reality lies within us. The result is
really this: the time when I shall not be will objectively come;
but subjectively it can never come. It might therefore, indeed,
be asked, how far every one, in his heart, actually believes in a
thing which he really cannot conceive at all; or whether, since the profound consciousness of the indestructibleness of our true nature associates itself with that merely intellectual experiment,
which, however, has already been made more or less distinctly
by every one, whether, I say, our own death is not perhaps for us
at bottom the most incredible thing in the world.

The deep conviction of the indestructibleness of our nature
through death, which, as is also shown by the inevitable qualms
of conscience at its approach, every one carries at the bottom of
his heart, depends altogether upon the consciousness of the orig-
inal and eternal nature of our being: therefore Spinoza expresses
it thus: “Sentimus, experimurque, nos æternos esse.” For a rea-
sonable man can only think of himself as imperishable, because
he thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact as
timeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards himself as having
become out of nothing must also think that he will again become
nothing; for that an eternity had passed before he was, and then a
second eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to
be, is a monstrous thought. Really the most solid ground for our
immortality is the old principle: “Ex nihilo nihil fit, et in nihilum
nihil potest reverti.” Theophrastus Paracelsus very happily says
(Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. p. 6): “The soul in me has
arisen out of something; therefore it does not come to nothing;
for it comes out of something.” He gives the true reason. 

But whoever regards the birth of the man as his absolute beginning [281]
must regard death as his absolute end. For both are what they
are in the same sense; consequently every one can only think of
himself as immortal so far as he also thinks of himself as unborn,
and in the same sense. What birth is, that also is death, according
to its nature and significance: it is the same line drawn in two
directions. If the former is an actual arising out of nothing, then
the latter is also an actual annihilation. But in truth it is only by
means of the eternity of our real being that we can conceive it
as imperishable, and consequently this imperishableness is not
temporal. 

The assumption that man is made out of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute end. Thus
in this the Old Testament is perfectly consistent; for no doctrine
of immortality is suitable to a creation out of nothing. New
Testament Christianity has such a doctrine because it is Indian
in spirit, and therefore more than probably also of Indian origin,
although only indirectly, through Egypt. But to the Jewish stem,
upon which that Indian wisdom had to be grafted in the Holy
Land, such a doctrine is as little suited as the freedom of the will
to its determinism, or as “Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere si velit.”
It is always bad if one cannot be thoroughly original, and dare
not carve out of the whole wood. Brahmanism and Buddhism,
on the other hand, have quite consistently, besides the continued
existence after death, an existence before birth to expiate the
guilt of which we have this life. Moreover, how distinctly con-
scious they were of the necessary consistency in this is shown by
the following passage from Colebrooke's “History of the Indian
Philosophy” in the “Transac. of the Asiatic London Society,”
vol. i. p. 577: “Against the system of the Bhagavatas which
is but partially heretical, the objection upon which the chief[282]
stress is laid by Vyaso is, that the soul would not be eternal if it
were a production, and consequently had a beginning.” 

Further, in Upham's “Doctrine of Buddhism,” p. 110, it is said: “The lot
in hell of impious persons called Deitty is the most severe: these
are they who, discrediting the evidence of Buddha, adhere to the
heretical doctrine that all living beings had their beginning in the
mother's womb, and will have their end in death.”

Whoever conceives his existence as merely accidental must
certainly fear that he will lose it by death. On the other hand,
whoever sees, even only in general, that his existence rests upon
some kind of original necessity will not believe that this which
has produced so wonderful a thing is limited to such a brief span
of time, but that it is active in every one. But he will recognise his existence as necessary who reflects that up till now, when he exists, already an infinite time, thus also an infinity of changes,
has run its course, but in spite of this he yet exists; thus the
Whole range of all possible states has already exhausted itself
without being able to destroy his existence. If he could ever
not be, he would already not be now. For the infinity of the
time that has already elapsed, with the exhausted possibility of
the events in it, guarantees that what exists, exists necessarily.

Therefore every one must conceive himself as a necessary being,
i.e., as a being whose existence would follow from its true and
exhaustive definition if one only had it. In this line of thought,
then, really lies the only immanent proof of the imperishableness
of our nature, i.e., the only proof of this that holds good within
the sphere of empirical data. In this nature existence must inhere,
because it shows itself as independent of all states which can
possibly be introduced through the chain of causes; for these
states have already done what they could, and yet our existence
has remained unshaken by it, as the ray of light by the storm
wind which it cuts through.

If time, of its own resources, could bring us to a happy state, then we would already have been there
long ago; for an infinite time lies behind us. But also: if it
could lead us to destruction, we would already have long been
no more. From the fact that we now exist, it follows, if well
considered, that we must at all times exist. 

We are ourselves the nature which time has taken up into itself in order to fill its
void; consequently it fills the whole of time, present, past, and
future, in the same way, and it is just as impossible for us to fall
out of existence as to fall out of space. Carefully considered, it is
inconceivable that what once exists in all the strength of reality
should ever become nothing, and then not be, through an infinite
time. Hence has arisen the Christian doctrine of the restoration of
all things, that of the Hindus of the constantly repeated creation
of the world by Brahma, together with similar dogmas of the Greek philosophers. The great mystery of our being and not being, to explain which these and all kindred dogmas have been devised, ultimately rests upon the fact that the same thing which objectively constitutes an infinite course of time is subjectively
an indivisible, ever present present: but who comprehends it?
