Kant has the immortal doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality of the thing in itself. 

For it results from this that the really essential part of
things, of man, of the world, lies permanently and enduringly in
the Nunc stans, firm and immovable; and that the change of the
phenomena and events is a mere consequence of our apprehen-
sion of them by means of our form of perception, which is time.

Accordingly, instead of saying to men, “Ye have arisen through
birth, but are immortal,” one ought to say to them, “Ye are not
nothing,” and teach them to understand this in the sense of the
saying attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, “§ø ≥±¡ @Ω μπ √ƒ±π”
(Quod enim est, erit semper), Stob. Ecl., i. 43, 6. If, however, this
does not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its old lament, “I[284]
see all beings arise through birth out of nothing, and after a brief
term again return to this; my existence also, now in the present,
will soon lie in the distant past, and I will be nothing!”—the
right answer is, “Dost thou not exist? Hast thou not within thee
the valuable present, after which ye children of time so eagerly
strive, now within, actually within? And dost thou understand
how thou hast attained to it? Knowest thou the paths which have
led thee to it, that thou canst know they will be shut against thee
by death? An existence of thyself after the destruction of thy
body is not conceivable by thee as possible; but can it be more
inconceivable to thee than thy present existence, and how thou
hast attained to it? Why shouldst thou doubt but that the secret
paths to this present, which stood open to thee, will also stand
open to every future present?”

If, then, considerations of this kind are at any rate adapted
to awaken the conviction that there is something in us which
death cannot destroy, this yet only takes place by raising us to a point of view from which birth is not the beginning of our existence.

But from this it follows that what is proved to be indestructible by death is not properly the individual, which,
moreover, as having arisen through generation, and having in
itself the qualities of the father and mother, presents itself as a
mere difference of the species, but as such can only be finite.
As, in accordance with this, the individual has no recollection
of its existence before its birth, so it can have no remembrance
of its present existence after death. But every one places his
ego in consciousness; this seems to him therefore to be bound to
individuality, with which, besides, everything disappears which
is peculiar to him, as to this, and distinguishes him from others.

His continued existence without individuality becomes to him
therefore indistinguishable from the continuance of other beings,
and he sees his ego sink. But whoever thus links his existence to
the identity of consciousness, and therefore desires an endless [285]
existence after death for this, ought to reflect that he can certainly
only attain this at the price of just as endless a past before birth.

For since he has no remembrance of an existence before birth,
thus his consciousness begins with birth, he must accept his birth
as an origination of his existence out of nothing. But then he
purchases the endless time of his existence after death for just
as long a time before birth; thus the account balances without
any profit for him. If, on the other hand, the existence which
death leaves untouched is different from that of the individual
consciousness, then it must be independent of birth, just as of
death; and therefore, with regard to it, it must be equally true to
say, “I will always be,” and “I have always been;” which then
gives two infinities for one. But the great equivocation really
lies in the word “I,” as any one will see at once who remembers
the contents of our second book, and the separation which is
made there of the willing from the knowing part of our nature.
According as I understand this word I can say, “Death is my
complete end;” or, “This my personal phenomenal existence is just as infinitely small a part of my true nature as I am of the world.” 

But the “I” is the dark point in consciousness, as on the
retina the exact point at which the nerve of sight enters is blind,
as the brain itself is entirely without sensation, the body of the
sun is dark, and the eye sees all except itself. 

Our faculty of knowledge is directed entirely towards without, in accordance
with the fact that it is the product of a brain function, which
has arisen for the purpose of mere self-maintenance, thus of the
search for nourishment and the capture of prey. Therefore every
one knows himself only as this individual as it presents itself
in external perception. If, on the other hand, he could bring to
consciousness what he is besides and beyond this, then he would
willingly give up his individuality, smile at the tenacity of his
attachment to it, and say, “What is the loss of this individuality
to me, who bear in myself the possibility of innumerable individualities?” He would see that even if a continued existence of his individuality does not lie before him, it is yet quite as good
as if he had such an existence, because he carries in himself
complete compensation for it. Besides, however, it may further
be taken into consideration that the individuality of most men is
so miserable and worthless that with it they truly lose nothing,
and that that in them which may still have some worth is the
universal human element; but to this imperishableness can be
promised. Indeed, even the rigid unalterableness and essential
limitation of every individual would, in the case of an endless
duration of it, necessarily at last produce such great weariness
by its monotony that only to be relieved of this one would prefer
to become nothing. To desire that the individuality should be
immortal really means to wish to perpetuate an error infinitely.

For at bottom every individuality is really only a special error,
a false step, something that had better not be; nay, something
which it is the real end of life to bring us back from. This
also finds confirmation in the fact that the great majority, indeed
really all men, are so constituted that they could not be happy in whatever kind of world they might be placed. In proportion as such a world excluded want and hardship, they would become
a prey to ennui, and in proportion as this was prevented, they
would fall into want, misery, and suffering.

Thus for a blessed condition of man it would be by no means sufficient that he
should be transferred to a “better world,” but it would also be
necessary that a complete change should take place in himself;
that thus he should no longer be what he is, and, on the contrary,
should become what he is not. But for this he must first of all
cease to be what he is: this desideratum is, as a preliminary,
supplied by death, the moral necessity of which can already be
seen from this point of view. To be transferred to another world
and to have his whole nature changed are, at bottom, one and
the same. Upon this also ultimately rests that dependence of the [287]
objective upon the subjective which the idealism of our first book
shows. Accordingly here lies the point at which the transcendent
philosophy links itself on to ethics. If one considers this one
will find that the awaking from the dream of life is only possible
through the disappearance along with it of its whole ground-warp
also, But this is its organ itself, the intellect together with its
forms, with which the dream would spin itself out without end,
so firmly is it incorporated with it. That which really dreamt
this dream is yet different from it, and alone remains over. On
the other hand, the fear that with death all will be over may be
compared to the case of one who imagines in a dream that there
are only dreams without a dreamer. But now, after an individual
consciousness has once been ended by death, would it even be
desirable that it should be kindled again in order to continue for
ever? The greater part of its content, nay, generally its whole
content, is nothing but a stream of small, earthly, paltry thoughts
and endless cares. Let them, then, at last be stilled! Therefore
with a true instinct, the ancients inscribed upon their gravestones:
Securitati perpetuæ;—or Bonæ quieti. But if here, as so often has
happened, a continued existence of the individual consciousness should be desired, in order to connect with it a future reward or
punishment, what would really be aimed at in this would simply
be the compatibility of virtue and egoism. But these two will
never embrace: they are fundamentally opposed. On the other
hand, the conviction is well founded, which the sight of noble
conduct calls forth, that the spirit of love, which enjoins one man
to spare his enemy, and another to protect at the risk of his life
some one whom he has never seen before, can never pass away
and become nothing.
