<!-- The most thorough answer to the question as to the continued existence of the individual after death lies in  -->

Kant's great doctrine of the ideality of time answers questions about life after death. 

<!-- , which just here shows itself specially fruitful and rich in consequences, for  -->

It substitutes a purely theoretical but well-proved insight for dogmas which lead to the absurd.

Thus it settles at once the most exciting of all metaphysical questions.

Beginning, ending, and continuing are conceptions which derive
their significance simply and solely from time, and are therefore
valid only under the presupposition of this. But time has no
absolute existence; it is not the manner of being of the thing in
itself, but merely the form of our knowledge of our existence
and nature, and that of all things, which is just on this account
very imperfect, and is limited to mere phenomena. 

Thus with reference to this knowledge alone do the conceptions of ceasing
and continuing find application, not with reference to that which
exhibits itself in these, the inner being of things in relation to
which these conceptions have therefore no longer any meaning.
For this shows itself also in the fact that an answer to the ques-
tion which arises from those time-conceptions is impossible, and
every assertion of such an answer, whether upon one side or the
other, is open to convincing objections. One might indeed assert
that our true being continues after death because it is false that it
is destroyed; but one might just as well assert that it is destroyed
because it is false that it continues: at bottom the one is as true as the other. Accordingly something like an antinomy might certainly be set up here. But it would rest upon mere negations.

In it one would deny two contradictorily opposite predicates of
the subject of the judgment, but only because the whole category
of these predicates would be inapplicable to that subject. But if
now one denies these two predicates, not together, but separately,
it appears as if the contradictory opposite of the predicate which
in each case is denied were proved of the subject of the judgment.
This, however, depends upon the fact that here incommensurable
quantities are compared, for the problem removes us to a scene
where time is abolished, and yet asks about temporal properties
which it is consequently equally false to attribute to, or to deny [289]
of the subject. This just means: the problem is transcendent. In
this sense death remains a mystery.

On the other hand, adhering to that distinction between phe-
nomenon and thing in itself, we can make the assertion that, as
phenomenon, man is certainly perishable, but yet his true being
will not be involved in this. Thus this true being is indestructible,
although, on account of the elimination of time-conceptions
which is connected with it, we cannot attribute to it continu-
ance. Accordingly we would be led here to the conception of
an indestructibility which would yet be no continuance. Now
this is a conception which, having been obtained on the path of
abstraction, can certainly also be thought in the abstract, but yet
cannot be supported by any perception, and consequently cannot
really become distinct; yet, on the other hand, we must here keep
in mind that we have not, like Kant, absolutely given up the
knowledge of the thing in itself, but know that it is to be sought
for in the will. It is true that we have never asserted an absolute
and exhaustive knowledge of the thing in itself, but rather have
seen very well that it is impossible to know anything as it is
absolutely and in itself. For as soon as I know, I have an idea;
but this idea, just because it is my idea, cannot be identical with
what is known, but repeats it in an entirely different form, for it makes a being for other out of a being for self, and is thus always to be regarded as a phenomenal appearance of the thing
in itself. 

Therefore for a knowing consciousness, however it may
be constituted, there can be always only phenomena. This is not
entirely obviated even by the fact that it is my own nature which
is known; for, since it falls within my knowing consciousness,
it is already a reflex of my nature, something different from
this itself, thus already in a certain degree phenomenon. So far,
then, as I am a knowing being, I have even in my own nature
really only a phenomenon; so far, on the other hand, as I am
directly this nature itself, I am not a knowing being. For it is[290]
sufficiently proved in the second book that knowledge is only a
secondary property of our being, and introduced by its animal
nature. Strictly speaking, then, we know even our own will
always merely as phenomenon, and not as it may be absolutely
in and for itself. But in that second book, and also in my work
upon the will in nature, it is fully explained and proved that
if, in order to penetrate into the inner nature of things, leaving
what is given merely indirectly and from without, we stick to
the only phenomenon into the nature of which an immediate
insight from within is attainable, we find in this quite definitely,
as the ultimate kernel of reality, the will, in which therefore we
recognise the thing in itself in so far as it has here no longer space,
although it still has time, for its form consequently really only in
its most immediate manifestation, and with the reservation that
this knowledge of it is still not exhaustive and entirely adequate.
Thus in this sense we retain here also the conception of will as
that of the thing in itself.
The conception of ceasing to be is certainly applicable to
man as a phenomenon in time, and empirical knowledge plainly
presents death as the end of this temporal existence. The end of
the person is just as real as was its beginning, and in the same
sense as before birth we were not, after death we shall be no
more. Yet no more can be destroyed by death than was produced by birth; thus not that through which birth first became possible.

In this sense natus et denatus is a beautiful expression. But now
the whole of empirical knowledge affords us merely phenomena;
therefore only phenomena are involved in the temporal processes
of coming into being and passing away, and not that which
manifests itself in the phenomena, the thing in itself. For this the
opposition of coming into being and passing away conditioned
by the brain, does not exist at all, but has here lost meaning and
significance. It thus remains untouched by the temporal end of [291]
a temporal phenomenon, and constantly retains that existence to
which the conceptions of beginning, end, and continuance are
not applicable. But the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is
in every phenomenal being the will of this being: so also in man.
Consciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. But
knowledge, as activity of the brain, and consequently as function
of the organism, belongs, as has been sufficiently proved, to the
mere phenomenon, and therefore ends with this. The will alone,
whose work, or rather whose image was the body, is that which
is indestructible. The sharp distinction of will from knowledge,
together with the primacy of the former, which constitutes the
fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore the
only key to the contradiction which presents itself in so many
ways, and arises ever anew in every consciousness, even the
most crude, that death is our end, and that yet we must be eternal
and indestructible, thus the sentimus, experimurque nos æternos
esse of Spinoza. All philosophers have erred in this: they place
the metaphysical, the indestructible, the eternal element in man
in the intellect. It lies exclusively in the will, which is entirely
different from the intellect, and alone is original. 

The intellect,
as was most fully shown in the second book, is a secondary
phenomenon, and conditioned by the brain, therefore beginning
and ending with this. The will alone is that which conditions,
the kernel of the whole phenomenon, consequently free from
the forms of the phenomenon to which time belongs, thus also indestructible. Accordingly with death consciousness is certainly lost, but not that which produced and sustained consciousness;
life is extinguished, but not the principle of life also, which
manifested itself in it. Therefore a sure feeling informs every
one that there is something in him which is absolutely imperish-
able and indestructible.
