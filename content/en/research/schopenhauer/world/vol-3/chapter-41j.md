The freshness and vividness of memories of the most distant time, of earliest childhood, bears
witness to the fact that something in us does not pass away with time, does not grow old, but endures unchanged. But what this imperishable element is one could not make clear to oneself. 

It is not consciousness any more than it is the body upon which
clearly consciousness depends. But it is just that which, when
it appears in consciousness, presents itself as will. Beyond this
immediate manifestation of it we certainly cannot go; because
we cannot go beyond consciousness; therefore the question what
that may be when it does not come within consciousness, i.e.,
what it is absolutely in itself, remains unanswerable.


In the phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time and
space, as principium individuationis, what presents itself is that
the human individual perishes, while the human race, on the
contrary, always remains and lives. But in the true being of
things, which is free from these forms, this whole distinction
between the individual and the race also disappears, and the two
are immediately one. The whole will to live is in the individual,
as it is in the race, and therefore the continuance of the species is
merely the image of the indestructibility of the individual.
Since, then, the infinitely important understanding of the inde-
structibility of our true nature by death depends entirely upon the
distinction between phenomenon and thing in itself, I wish now
to bring this difference into the clearest light by explaining it in
the opposite of death, thus in the origin of the animal existence,
i.e., generation. 

For this process, which is just as mysterious as
death, presents to us most directly the fundamental opposition
between the phenomenal appearance and the true being of things, i.e., between the world as idea and the world as will, and also the entire heterogeneity of the laws of these two. The act of
procreation presents itself to us in a twofold manner: first, for
self-consciousness, whose only object, as I have often shown, is
the will, with all its affections; and then for the consciousness
of other things, i.e., the world of idea, or the empirical reality [293]
of things. Now, from the side of the will, thus inwardly, subjec-
tively, for self-consciousness, that act presents itself as the most
immediate and complete satisfaction of the will, i.e., as sensual
pleasure. From the side of the idea, on the other hand, thus
externally, objectively, for the consciousness of other things, this
act is just the woof of the most cunning of webs, the foundation
of the inexpressibly complicated animal organism, which then
only requires to be developed to become visible to our astonished
eyes. This organism, whose infinite complication and perfection
is only known to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the
side of the idea, be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a
system devised with the most ingenious forethought and carried
out with the most consummate skill and exactness, as the most
arduous work of profound reflection. But from the side of the
will we know, through self-consciousness, the production of this
organism as the work of an act which is exactly the opposite
of all reflection, an impetuous, blind impulse, an exceedingly
pleasurable sensation. This opposition is closely related to the
infinite contrast, which is shown above, between the absolute
facility with which nature produces its works, together with the
correspondingly boundless carelessness with which it abandons
them to destruction, and the incalculably ingenious and studied
construction of these very works, judging from which they must
have been infinitely difficult to make, and their maintenance
should have been provided for with all conceivable care; while
we have the opposite before our eyes. If now by this certainly
very unusual consideration, we have brought together in the
boldest manner the two heterogeneous sides of the world, and, as it were, grasped them with one hand, we must now hold them
fast in order to convince ourselves of the entire invalidity of the
laws of the phenomenon, or the world as idea, for that of will, or
the thing in itself. Then it will become more comprehensible to
us that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the phenomenal[294]
world, there exhibits itself to us now an arising out of nothing,
and now an entire annihilation of what has arisen, from that
other side, or in itself, a nature lies before us with reference
to which the conceptions of arising and passing away have no
significance. For, by going back to the root, where, by means
of self-consciousness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself
meet, we have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two
are absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of being
of the one, together with all the fundamental laws of its being,
signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the other. I believe that
this last consideration will only be rightly understood by a few,
and that it will be displeasing and even offensive to all who do
not understand it, but I shall never on this account omit anything
that can serve to illustrate my fundamental thought.

At the beginning of this chapter I have explained that the great
clinging to life, or rather fear of death, by no means springs from
knowledge, in which case it would be the result of the known
value of life; but that that fear of death has its root directly in the
will, out of the original nature of which it proceeds, in which it
is entirely without knowledge, and therefore blind will to live.
As we are allured into life by the wholly illusory inclination to
sensual pleasure, so we are retained in it by the fear of death,
which is certainly just as illusory. Both spring directly from the
will, which in itself is unconscious. If, on the contrary, man
were merely a knowing being, then death would necessarily be
to him not only indifferent, but even welcome. The reflection to
which we have here attained now teaches that what is affected
by death is merely the knowing consciousness, and the will, on
the other hand, because it is the thing in itself, which lies at the foundation of every phenomenon, is free from all that depends upon temporal determinations, thus is also imperishable. 

Its striving towards existence and manifestation, from which the world results, is constantly satisfied, for this accompanies it as the shadow accompanies the body, for it is merely the visibility of its nature. That yet in us it fears death results from the fact that here knowledge presents its existence to it as merely in the individual phenomenon, whence the illusion arises that it will perish with this, as my image in a mirror seems to be destroyed
along with it if the mirror is broken; this then, as contrary to its
original nature, which is a blind striving towards existence, fills
it with horror. 

From this now it follows that that in us which alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone fears it, the
will, is not affected by it; and that, on the other hand, what is
affected by it and really perishes is that which from its nature is
capable of no fear, and in general of no desire or emotion, and is
therefore indifferent to being and not being, the mere subject of
knowledge, the intellect, whose existence consists in its relation
to the world of idea, i.e., the objective world, whose correlative
it is, and with whose existence its own is ultimately one. 

Thus, although the individual consciousness does not survive death, yet that survives it which alone struggles against it—the will.

This also explains the contradiction that from the standpoint of
knowledge philosophers have always proved with cogent reasons
that death is no evil; yet the fear of death remains inevitable for
all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge, but in the will. It is
also a result of the fact that only the will, and not the intellect,
is indestructible, that all religions and philosophies promise a
reward in eternity only to the virtues of the will, or heart, not to
those of the intellect, or head.

The following may also serve to illustrate this consideration.
The will, which constitutes our true being, is of a simple nature;
it merely wills, and does not know. The subject of knowledge,
on the other hand, is a secondary phenomenon, arising from the objectification of the will; it is the point of unity of the sensibility of the nervous system, as it were the focus in which the rays of the activity of all the parts of the brain unite. 

With this, then, it must perish. In self-consciousness, as that which alone knows, it
stands over against the will as its spectator, and, although sprung
from it, knows it as something different from itself, something
foreign to it, and consequently also only empirically, in time, by
degrees, in its successive excitements and acts, and also learns
its decisions only a posteriori, and often very indirectly. This
explains the fact that our own nature is a riddle to us, i.e., to our
intellect, and that the individual regards itself as having newly
arisen and as perishable; although its true nature is independent
of time, thus is eternal.

As now the will does not know, so conversely the intellect, or the subject of knowledge, is simply
and solely knowing, without ever willing. This can be proved
even physically in the fact that, as was already mentioned in the
second book, according to Bichat, the various emotions directly
affect all parts of the organism and disturb their functions, with
the exception of the brain, which can only be affected by them
very indirectly, i.e., just in consequence of those disturbances
(De la vie et de la mort, art. 6, § 2). But from this it follows
that the subject of knowledge, for itself and as such, cannot take
part or interest in anything, but for it the being or not being of
everything, nay, even of its own self, is a matter of indifference.
Now why should this purely neutral being be immortal? 

It ends with the temporal manifestation of the will, i.e., the individual,
as it arose with it. It is the lantern which is extinguished when
it has served its end. The intellect, like the perceptible world
which exists only in it, is a mere phenomenon; but the finiteness
of both does not affect that of which they are the phenomenal
appearance.
