The intellect is the function of the cerebral nervous system; but the latter, like the rest of the body, is the objectivity
of the will. Therefore the intellect depends upon the somatic life of the organism; but this itself depends upon the will. 

The organised body may thus, in a certain sense, be regarded as
the link between the will and the intellect; although really it is
only the will itself exhibiting itself spatially in the perception
of the intellect. Death and birth are the constant renewal of
the consciousness of the will, in itself without end and without
beginning, which alone is, as it were, the substance of existence
(but each such renewal brings a new possibility of the denial
of the will to live).

Consciousness is the life of the subject of knowledge, or the brain, and death is its end. And therefore,
finally, consciousness is always new, in each case beginning at
the beginning. The will alone is permanent; and, moreover, it is
it alone that permanence concerns; for it is the will to live. The
knowing subject for itself is not concerned about anything. In the
ego, however, the two are bound up together. In every animal
existence the will has achieved an intellect which is the light by
which it here pursues its ends. It may be remarked by the way
that the fear of death may also partly depend upon the fact that
the individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect which
has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, its guide and
guard, without which it knows that it is helpless and blind.
Finally, this explanation also agrees with the commonplace
moral experience which teaches us that the will alone is real,
while its objects, on the other hand, as conditioned by knowledge,
are only phenomena, are only froth and vapour, like the wine
which Mephistopheles provided in Auerbach's cellar: after every
sensuous pleasure we also say, “And yet it seemed as I were
drinking wine.”

The terrors of death depend for the most part upon the false
illusion that now the ego vanishes and the world remains. But
rather is the opposite the case; the world vanishes, but the inmost
kernel of the ego, the supporter and producer of that subject, in [298]
whose idea alone the world has its existence, remains. With the
brain the intellect perishes, and with the intellect the objective
world, its mere idea. 

That in other brains, afterwards as before, a similar world lives and moves is, with reference to the intellect which perishes, a matter of indifference. If, therefore, reality
proper did not lie in the will, and if the moral existence were
not that which extends beyond death, then, since the intellect,
and with it its world, is extinguished, the true nature of things in
general would be no more than an endless succession of short and
troubled dreams, without connection among themselves; for the
permanence of unconscious nature consists merely in the idea of
time of conscious nature. Thus a world-spirit dreaming without
end or aim, dreams which for the most part are very troubled and
heavy, would then be all in all.

When, now, an individual experiences the fear of death, we
have really before us the extraordinary, nay, absurd, spectacle of
the lord of the worlds, who fills all with his being, and through
whom alone everything that is has its existence, desponding and
afraid of perishing, of sinking into the abyss of eternal nothing-
ness;—while, in truth, all is full of him, and there is no place
where he is not, no being in which he does not live; for it is
not existence that supports him, but he that supports existence.
Yet it is he who desponds in the individual who suffers from
the fear of death, for he is exposed to the illusion produced by
the principium individuationis that his existence is limited to the
nature which is now dying. This illusion belongs to the heavy
dream into which, as the will to live, he has fallen. But one might
say to the dying individual: “Thou ceasest to be something which
thou hadst done better never to become.”

So long as no denial of the will takes place, what death leaves
untouched is the germ and kernel of quite another existence, in
which a new individual finds itself again, so fresh and original that it broods over itself in astonishment. What sleep is for the individual, death is for the will as thing in itself. It would not
endure to continue the same actions and sufferings throughout an
eternity without true gain, if memory and individuality remained
to it. It flings them off, and this is lethe; and through this sleep of death it reappears refreshed and fitted out with another intellect,
as a new being—“a new day tempts to new shores.”

As the self-asserting will to live man has the root of his
existence in the species. Accordingly death is the loss of one individuality and the assumption of another, consequently a change of individuality under the exclusive guidance of one's own will.
For in this alone lies the eternal power which could produce its
existence with its ego, yet, on account of its nature, was not able
to maintain it in existence. For death is the démenti which the
essence (essentia) of every one receives in its claim to existence
(existentia), the appearance of a contradiction which lies in every
individual existence: 

“For all that arises Is worthy of being destroyed.”

But an infinite number of such existences, each with its ego,
stands within reach of this power, thus of the will, which, howev-
er, will again prove just as transitory and perishable. Since now
every ego has its separate consciousness, that infinite number of
them is, with reference to such an ego, not different from a single
one. From this point of view it appears to me not accidental that
ævum, ±0…Ω, signifies both the individual term of life and infinite
time. Indeed from this point of view it may be seen, although
indistinctly, that ultimately and in themselves both are the same;
and according to this there would really be no difference whether
I existed only through my term of life or for an infinite time.

Certainly, however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that is said above entirely without time-concepts; yet when we are dealing with the thing in itself these ought to be excluded. But it belongs
to the unalterable limitations of our intellect that it can never
entirely cast off this first and most immediate form of all its
ideas, in order to operate without it. 

Therefore we certainly come
here upon a kind of metempsychosis, although with the important difference that it does not concern the whole »≈«∑, not the knowing being, but the will alone; and thus, with the conscious-
ness that the form of time only enters here as an unavoidable
concession to the limitation of our intellect, so many absurdities
which accompany the doctrine of metempsychosis disappear. 

If we now call in the assistance of the fact, to be explained
in chapter 43, that the character, i.e., the will, is inherited from
the father, and the intellect, on the other hand, from the mother,
it agrees very well with our view that the will of a man, in itself
individual, separated itself in death from the intellect received
from the mother in generation, and in accordance with its now
modified nature, under the guidance of the absolutely necessary
course of the world harmonising with this, received through a
new generation a new intellect, with which it became a new
being, which had no recollection of an earlier existence; for the
intellect, which alone has the faculty of memory, is the mortal
part or the form, while the will is the eternal part, the substance.
In accordance with this, this doctrine is more correctly denoted by
the word palingenesis than by metempsychosis. These constant
new births, then, constitute the succession of the life-dreams
of a will which in itself is indestructible, until, instructed and
improved by so much and such various successive knowledge in
a constantly new form, it abolishes or abrogates itself.

The true esoteric doctrine of Buddhism:
- also agrees with this view.
- teaches not metempsychosis, but a peculiar palingenesis, resting upon a moral basis which it works out and explains with great profundity. 

This may be seen from the exposition of the subject, well worth reading and pondering, which is given in Spence Hardy's “Manual of Buddhism,” pp. 394-96 (with which compare pp. 429, 440, and 445 of the same book), the confirmation of which is to be found in Taylor's “Prabodh Chandro Daya,” London, 1812, p. 35; also in Sangermano's “Burmese Empire,” p. 6, and in the “Asiatic Researches,” vol. vi. p. 179, and vol. ix. p. 256. The very useful

German compendium of Buddhism by Köppen is also right upon
this point. Yet for the great mass of Buddhists this doctrine is too
subtle; therefore to them simple metempsychosis is preached as
a comprehensible substitute.
