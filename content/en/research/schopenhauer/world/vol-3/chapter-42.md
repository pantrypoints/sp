In the preceding chapter it was called to mind that the (Platonic)
Ideas of the different grades of beings, which are the adequate
objectification of the will to live, exhibit themselves in the knowl-
edge of the individual, which is bound to the form of time, as the
species, i.e., as the successive individuals of one kind connected
by the bond of generation, and that therefore the species is the
Idea (μ0¥ø¬, species) broken up in time. 

Accordingly the true nature of every living thing lies primarily in its species: yet
the species again has its existence only in the individuals. Now,
although the will only attains to self-consciousness in the individ-
ual, thus knows itself immediately only as the individual, yet the
deep-seated consciousness that it is really the species in which
his true nature objectifies itself appears in the fact that for the
individual the concerns of the species as such, thus the relations
of the sexes, the production and nourishment of the offspring,
are of incomparably greater importance and consequence than
everything else. Hence, then, arises in the case of the brutes, heat
or rut (an excellent description of the vehemence of which will
be found in Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. §§ 247, 257), and, in
the case of man, the careful and capricious selection of the other
individual for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, which can
rise to the height of passionate love, to the fuller investigation
of which I shall devote a special chapter: hence also, finally the
excessive love of parents for their offspring.

In the supplements to the second book the will was compared
to the root and the intellect to the crown of the tree; and this is
the case inwardly or psychologically. But outwardly or physio-
logically the genitals are the root and the head the crown. The
nourishing part is certainly not the genitals, but the villi of the
intestines: yet not the latter but the former are the root; because
through them the individual is connected with the species in
which it is rooted. For physically the individual is a production
302 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of the species, metaphysically a more or less perfect picture of
the Idea, which, in the form of time, exhibits itself as species. In
agreement with the relation expressed here, the greatest vitality,
and also the decrepitude of the brain and the genital organs, is
simultaneous and stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to
be regarded as the inner life of the tree (the species) upon which
the life of the individual grows, like a leaf that is nourished
by the tree, and assists in nourishing the tree; this is why that
impulse is so strong, and springs from the depths of our nature.
To castrate an individual means to cut him off from the tree of
the species upon which he grows, and thus severed, leave him to
wither: hence the degradation of his mental and physical powers.
That the service of the species, i.e., fecundation, is followed in
the case of every animal individual by momentary exhaustion
and debility of all the powers, and in the case of most insects
indeed by speedy death, on account of which Celsus said, “Se-
minis emissio est partis animæ jactura;” that in the case of man
the extinction of the generative power shows that the individual
approaches death; that excessive use of this power at every age
shortens life, while, on the other hand, temperance in this respect
increases all the powers, and especially the muscular powers, on
which account it was part of the training of the Greek athletes;
that the same restraint lengthens the life of the insect even to the
following spring; all this points to the fact that the life of the
individual is at bottom only borrowed from the species, and that[311]
all vital force is, as it were, force of the species restricted by
being dammed up. But this is to be explained from the fact that
the metaphysical substratum of life reveals itself directly in the
species and only by means of this in the individual. Accordingly
the Lingam with the Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its
immortality, is worshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of
death, is ascribed as an attribute to the very divinity who presides
over death, Siva.

But without myth or symbol, the vehemence of the sexual impulse, the keen intentness and profound seriousness with which
every animal, including man, pursues its concerns, shows that it
is through the function which serves it that the animal belongs
to that in which really and principally its true being lies, the
species; while all other functions and organs directly serve only
the individual, whose existence is at bottom merely secondary.
In the vehemence of that impulse, which is the concentration
of the whole animal nature, the consciousness further expresses
itself that the individual does not endure, and therefore all must
be staked on the maintenance of the species, in which its true
existence lies.
To illustrate what has been said, let us now imagine a brute
in rut, and in the act of generation. We see a seriousness and
intentness never known in it at any other time. Now what goes on
in it? Does it know that it must die, and that through its present
occupation a new individual, which yet entirely resembles itself,
will arise in order to take its place? Of all this it knows nothing,
for it does not think. But it is as intently careful for the continu-
ance of the species in time as if it knew all that. For it is conscious
that it desires to live and exist, and it expresses the highest degree
of this volition in the act of generation; this is all that then takes
place in its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient for the
permanence of the kind; just because the will is the radical and [312]
knowledge the adventitious. On this account the will does not
require to be guided by knowledge throughout; but whenever in
its primitive originality it has resolved, this volition will objectify
itself of its own accord in the world of the idea. If now in this
way it is that definite animal form which we have thought of
that wills life and existence, it does not will life and existence in
general, but in this particular form. 

Therefore it is the sight of its
form in the female of its species that stimulates the will of the
brute to the act of generation. This volition of the brute, when
regarded from without and under the form of time, presents itself
as such an animal form maintained through an infinite time by the constantly repeated replacement of one individual by anoth-
er, thus by the alternation of death and reproduction, which so
regarded appear only as the pulse-beats of that form (π¥μ±, μ0¥ø¬,
species) which endures through all time. They may be compared
to the forces of attraction and repulsion in which matter consists.
That which is shown here in the brute holds good also of man;
for although in him the act of generation is accompanied by
complete knowledge of its final cause, yet it is not guided by
this knowledge, but proceeds directly from the will to live as its
concentration. It is accordingly to be reckoned among instinctive
actions. For in reproduction the brute is just as little guided by
knowledge of the end as in mechanical instincts; in these also
the will manifests itself, in the main, without the mediation of
knowledge, which here, as there, is only concerned with details.
Reproduction is, to a certain extent, the most marvellous of all
instincts, and its work the most astonishing.
These considerations explain why the sexual desire has a very
different character from every other; it is not only the strongest,
but even specifically of a more powerful kind than any other. It
is everywhere tacitly assumed as necessary and inevitable, and
is not, like other desires, a matter of taste and disposition. For
it is the desire which even constitutes the nature of man. 

In conflict with it no motive is so strong that it would be certain
of victory. It is so pre-eminently the chief concern that no other
pleasures make up for the deprivation of its satisfaction; and,
moreover, for its sake both brute and man undertake every danger
and every conflict. A very naïve expression of this disposition is
the well-known inscription on the door of the fornix at Pompeii,
decorated with the phallus: “Heic habitat felicitas:” this was for
those going in naïve, for those coming out ironical, and in itself
humorous. On the other hand, the excessive power of the sexual
passion is seriously and worthily expressed in the inscription
which (according to Theon of Smyrna, De Musica, c. 47), Osiris
had placed upon the column he erected to the eternal gods: “To Eros, the spirit, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the earth, the
night, the day, and the father of all that is and that shall be;”
also in the beautiful apostrophe with which Lucretius begins his
work:

“Æneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
Alma Venus cet.”
