The relation of the sexes is really the invisible central point of all action and conduct.

It peeps out everywhere in spite of all veils thrown over it. It is the cause of
war and the end of peace, the basis of what is serious, and the aim
of the jest, the inexhaustible source of wit, the key to all allusions,
and the meaning of all mysterious hints, of all unspoken offers
and all stolen glances, the daily meditation of the young, and
often also of the old, the hourly thought of the unchaste, and
even against their will the constantly recurring imagination of
the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just because the
profoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the
piquant element and the joke of life that the chief concern of
all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored as much as possible.

But, in fact, we see it every moment seat itself, as the
true and hereditary lord of the world, out of the fulness of its
own strength, upon the ancestral throne, and looking down from
thence with scornful glances, laugh at the preparations which
have been made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it
and wherever it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to
master it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary
concern of life. But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual
passion is the kernel of the will to live, and consequently the
concentration of all desire; therefore in the text I have called the
genital organs the focus of the will. Indeed, one may say man is
concrete sexual desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and his wish of wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone perpetuates and holds together his whole phenomenal existence.

The will to live manifests itself indeed primarily as an effort
to sustain the individual; yet this is only a step to the effort
to sustain the species, and the latter endeavour must be more
powerful in proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of
the individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual
passion is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its
most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the individual
in it, and its primacy over all other desires of the natural man,
are both in complete agreement with this.

One other remark of a physiological nature is in place here,
a remark which throws light upon my fundamental doctrine ex-
pounded in the second book. As the sexual impulse is the most
vehement of desires, the wish of wishes, the concentration of all
our volition, and accordingly the satisfaction of it which exactly
corresponds to the individual wish of any one, that is, the desire
fixed upon a definite individual, is the summit and crown of his
happiness, the ultimate goal of his natural endeavours, with the
attainment of which everything seems to him to have been at-[315]
tained, and with the frustrating of which everything seems to him
to have been lost:—so we find, as its physiological correlative,
in the objectified will, thus in the human organism, the sperm
or semen as the secretion of secretions, the quintessence of all
animal fluids, the last result of all organic functions, and have in
it a new proof of the fact that the body is only the objectivity of
the will, i.e., is the will itself under the form of the idea.

With reproduction is connected the maintenance of the offspring, and with the sexual impulse, parental love; and thus
through these the life of the species is carried on. Accordingly
the love of the brute for its young has, like the sexual impulse, a
strength which far surpasses that of the efforts which merely con-
cerns itself as an individual. This shows itself in the fact that even
the mildest animals are ready to undertake for the sake of their
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 307
young even the most unequal battle for life and death, and with
almost all species of animals the mother encounters any danger
for the protection of her young, nay, in many cases even faces
certain death. In the case of man this instinctive parental love
is guided and directed by reason, i.e., by reflection. Sometimes,
however, it is also in this way restricted, and with bad characters
this may extend to the complete repudiation of it. Therefore we
can observe its effects most purely in the lower animals. In itself,
however, it is not less strong in man; here also, in particular
cases, we see it entirely overcome self-love, and even extend to
the sacrifice of life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers
have just announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a
father has taken his own life in order that his son, who had been
drawn for military service, should be the eldest son of a widow,
and therefore exempt (Galignani's Messenger of 22d June 1843).

Yet in the case of the lower animals, since they are capable
of no reflection, the instinctive maternal affection (the male is
generally ignorant of his paternity) shows itself directly and [316]
unsophisticated, and therefore with perfect distinctness and in its
whole strength. At bottom it is the expression of the conscious-
ness in the brute that its true being lies more immediately in the
species than in the individual, and therefore, when necessary, it
sacrifices its life that the species may be maintained in the young.
Thus here, as also in the sexual impulse, the will to live becomes
to a certain extent transcendent, for its consciousness extends
beyond the individual, in which it is inherent, to the species. In
order to avoid expressing this second manifestation of the life of
the species in a merely abstract manner, and to present it to the
reader in its magnitude and reality, I will give a few examples of
the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal affection.
The sea-otter, when pursued, seizes its young one and dives
with it; when it comes up again to take breath, it covers the
young one with its body, and receives the harpoon of the hunter
while the young one is escaping. A young whale is killed merely to attract the mother, who hurries to it and seldom forsakes it
so long as it still lives, even although she is struck with several
harpoons (Scoresby's “Journal of a Whaling Voyage;” from the
English of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near New
Zealand, there are colossal seals called sea-elephants (phoca pro-
boscidea). They swim round the island in regular herds and feed
upon fishes, but yet have certain terrible enemies below water
unknown to us, by whom they are often severely wounded; hence
their swimming together requires special tactics. The females
bring forth their young upon the shore; while they are suckling
them, which lasts from seven to eight weeks, all the males form
a circle round them in order to prevent them, driven by hunger,
from entering the sea, and if this is attempted they prevent it by
biting. Thus they all fast together for between seven and eight
weeks, and all become very thin, simply in order that the young
may not enter the sea before they are able to swim well and[317]
observe the necessary tactics which are then taught them with
blows and bites (Freycinet, Voy. aux terres Australes, 1826). We
also see here how parental affection, like every strong exertion
of the will (cf. chap. xix. 6), heightens the intelligence. Wild
ducks, white-throats, and many other birds, when the sportsman
comes near their nest, fly in front of him with loud cries and
flap about as if their wings were injured, in order to attract his
attention from their young to themselves. The lark tries to entice
the dog away from its nest by exposing itself. In the same way
hinds and does induce the hunter to pursue them in order that
their young may not be attacked. Swallows have flown into
burning houses to rescue their young or perish with them. At
Delft, in a great fire, a stork allowed itself to be burnt in its
nest rather than forsake its tender young, which could not yet
fly (Hadr. Junius, Descriptio Hollandiæ). Mountain-cocks and
woodcocks allow themselves to be taken upon the nest when
brooding. Muscicapa tyrannus protects its nest with remarkable
courage, and defends itself against eagles. An ant has been cut in 2, and the fore half been seen to bring the pupæ to a place
of safety. A bitch whose litter had been cut out of her belly crept
up to them dying, caressed them, and began to whine violently
only when they were taken from her (Burdach, Physiologie als
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. ii. and iii.).

The most ordinary experience teaches that in generation the combined seed of the parents not only propagates the peculiarities
of the species, but also those of the individual, as far as bodily
(objective, external) qualities are concerned, and this has also
always been recognised—

“Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ.”
—CATULL.

Now whether this also holds good of mental (subjective, in-
ternal) qualities, so that these also are transmitted by the parents
to the children, is a question which has already often been raised,
and almost always answered in the affirmative. More difficult,
however, is the problem whether it is possible to distinguish what
belongs to the father and what to the mother, thus what is the
mental inheritance which we receive from each of our parents.
If now we cast upon this problem the light of our fundamental
knowledge that the will is the true being, the kernel, the radical
element in man, and the intellect, on the other hand, is what is
secondary, adventitious, the accident of that substance; before
questioning experience we will assume it as at least probable
that the father, as sexus potior and the procreative principle,
imparts the basis, the radical element, of the new life, thus the
will, and the mother, as sexus sequior and merely conceiving
principle, imparts the secondary element, the intellect; that thus
the man inherits his moral nature, his character, his inclinations,
his heart, from the father, and, on the other hand, the grade, quality, and tendency of his intelligence from the mother. 

Now this assumption actually finds its confirmation in experience; only this cannot be decided by a physical experiment upon the table, but results partly from the careful and acute observation of
many years, and partly from history.
