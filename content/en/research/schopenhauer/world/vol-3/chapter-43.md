One's own experience has the advantage of complete certainty and the greatest speciality, and this outweighs the disadvantage that arises from it, that its sphere is limited and its examples not
generally known. 

Therefore, primarily, I refer every one to his own experience. 

First of all let him consider himself, confess
to himself his inclinations and passions, his characteristic errors
and weaknesses, his vices, and also his excellences and virtues, if
he has any. Then let him think of his father, and he cannot fail to
recognise all these characteristic traits in him also. On the other
hand, he will often find his mother of an entirely different char-
acter, and a moral agreement with her will very seldom occur,
indeed only through the exceptional accident of a similarity of
the character of the two parents. Let him make this examination,
for example, with reference to quick temper or patience, avarice
or prodigality, inclination to sensuality, or to intemperance, or to
gambling, hard-heartedness or kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy,
pride or condescension, courage or cowardice, peaceableness
or quarrelsomeness, placability or resentfulness, &c. Then let
him make the same investigation with regard to all those whose
characters and whose parents he has accurately known. If he
proceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the
confirmation of our principle will not be lacking. 

Thus, for
example, he will find the special tendency to lie, which belongs
to many men, equally present in two brothers, because they have
inherited it from the father; on this account also the comedy,
“The Liar and his Son,” is psychologically correct. However,
two inevitable limitations must here be borne in mind, which
only open injustice could interpret as evasions. First, pater [320]
semper incertus. Only a decided physical resemblance to the
father removes this limitation; a superficial resemblance, on the
other hand, is not sufficient to do so; for there is an after-effect
of earlier impregnation by virtue of which the children of the
second marriage have sometimes still a slight resemblance to the
first husband, and children begotten in adultery to the legitimate father. 

Such an after-effect has been still more distinctly observed in the case of brutes. The second limitation is, that in the son the moral character of the father certainly appears, yet under the
modification which it has received through another and often
very different intellect (the inheritance from the mother), and
thus a correction of the observation becomes necessary. This
modification may be important or trifling in proportion to that
difference, but it can never be so great that the fundamental traits
of the paternal character do not always appear under it recog-
nisably enough, like a man who has disguised himself by an
entirely different kind of dress, wig, and beard. 

For example, if by inheritance from the mother a man is pre-eminently endowed with reason, thus with the power of reflection and deliberation, the passions inherited from his father are partly bridled by this, partly concealed, and accordingly only attain to a methodical, systematic, or secret manifestation, and thus a very different phenomenon from that of the father, who perhaps had only a very limited mind, will then result; and in the same way the converse case may occur. The inclinations and passions of the mother, on the other hand, do not reappear at all in the children, often indeed their opposite.

Historical examples have the advantage over those of private
life of being universally known; but, on the other hand, they are
of course impaired by the uncertainty and frequent falsification
of all tradition, and especially also by the fact that as a rule they
only contain the public, not the private life, and consequently
only the political actions, not the finer manifestations of char-[321]
acter. However, I wish to support the truth we are speaking of
by a few historical examples, to which those who have made a
special study of history can no doubt add a far larger number of
equally pertinent cases.

P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life for his country with heroic nobleness; for, solemnly committing
himself and the enemy to the infernal deities, with covered face he plunged into the army of the Latins. About forty years later his son, of the same name, did exactly the same thing in the war
against the Gauls (Liv. viii. 6; x. 28). Thus a thorough proof
of the Horatian fortes creantur fortibus et bonis: the converse of
which is thus given by Shakspeare—
“Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base.”
—CYMBELINE, iv. 2.

Early Roman history presents to us whole families whose
members in long succession distinguished themselves by devot-
ed patriotism and courage; such were the gens Fabia and the gens
Fabricia. Again, Alexander the Great was fond of power and
conquest, like his father Philip. The pedigree of Nero which, with
a moral intention, Suetonius (c. 4 et 5) gives at the beginning of
his sketch of this monster is very well worth considering. It is the
gens Claudia he describes, which flourished in Rome through six
centuries, and produced not only capable, but arrogant and cruel
men. From it sprang Tiberius, Caligula, and finally Nero. 

In his
grandfather, and still more strongly in his father, all those atrocious qualities show themselves, which could only attain their
perfect development in Nero, partly because his higher position
afforded them freer scope, partly because he had for his mother
the irrational Bacchante, Agrippina, who could impart to him
no intellect to bridle his passions. Quite in our sense, therefore,
Suetonius relates that at his birth præsagio fuit etiam Domitii,
patris, vox, inter gratulationes amicorum, negantis, quidquam
ex se et Agrippina, nisi detestabile et malo publico nasci po- [322]
tuisse. On the other hand, Cimon was the son of Miltiades, and
Hannibal of Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole family
of heroes and noble defenders of their country. But the son of
Pope Alexander VI. was his hideous image, Cæsar Borgia. The
son of the notorious Duke of Alba was just as cruel and wicked a
man as his father. The malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France,
who is specially known by his cruel torture and execution of the knights templars, had for his daughter Isabella, wife of Edward II. of England, who rebelled against her husband, took him prisoner, and after he had signed his abdication, since the attempt to kill him by ill-usage was unsuccessful, caused him to be put
to death in prison in a manner which is too horrible for me to
care to relate. The blood-thirsty tyrant and defensor fidei, Henry
VIII. of England had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen
Mary, equally distinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from
her numerous burnings of heretics has won the name of Bloody
Mary. His daughter by his second marriage, Elizabeth, received
an excellent understanding from her mother, Anne Boleyn, which
prevented bigotry and curbed the parental character in her, yet
did not do away with it; so that it still always shone through on
occasions, and distinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary
of Scotland. Van Geuns35 tells a story, after Marcus Donatus, of
a Scotch girl whose father had been burnt as a highway robber
and a cannibal when she was only one year old. Although she
was brought up among quite different people, there developed in
her the same craving for human flesh, and being caught in the act
of satisfying it, she was buried alive. In the Freimüthigen of the
13th July 1821 we read that in the department of Aube the police
pursued a girl because she had murdered two children, whom she
ought to have taken to the foundling hospital, in order to keep[323]
the little money given to the children. At last the police found
the girl on the road to Paris, near Romilly, drowned, and her own
father gave himself up as her murderer. Finally, let me mention a
couple of cases which have occurred recently, and have therefore
only the newspapers as their vouchers. In October 1836 a Count
Belecznai was condemned to death in Hungary because he had
murdered an official and severely wounded his own relations. His
elder brother was executed earlier as a patricide, and his father
also had been a murderer (Frankfurter Postzeitung of the 26th
35 “Disputatio de corporum habitudine, animæ, hujusque virium indice.”
Harderov., 1789, § 9. October 1836). 

A year later the youngest brother of this Count,
in the same street where the latter had murdered the official, fired
a pistol at the steward of his estates, but missed him (Frankfurter
Journal, 16th September 1837). In the Frankfurter Postzeitung
of the 19th November 1857 a correspondent in Paris announces
the condemnation to death of a very dangerous highway robber,
Lemaire, and his companions, and adds: “The criminal tendency
seems hereditary in his family and in those of his confederates,
as several of their race have died on the scaffold.” It follows from
a passage in the Laws of Plato that similar cases were already
known in Greece (Stob. Flor., vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of
crime will certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The
tendency to suicide is specially hereditary.

On the other hand, when we see the excellent Marcus Aurelius
have the wicked Commodus for a son, this does not not lead us
astray; for we know that the Diva Faustina was a uxor infamis.
On the contrary, we mark this case in order in analogous cases
to presume an analogous reason; for example, that Domitian was
the full brother of Titus I can never believe, but that Vespasian
also was a deceived husband.
