Awakened to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the will
finds itself an individual, in an endless and boundless world,
among innumerable individuals, all striving, suffering, erring;
and as if through a troubled dream it hurries back to its old
unconsciousness. Yet till then its desires are limitless, its claims
inexhaustible, and every satisfied desire gives rise to a new one.
No possible satisfaction in the world could suffice to still its
longings, set a goal to its infinite cravings, and fill the bottomless
abyss of its heart. Then let one consider what as a rule are the
satisfactions of any kind that a man obtains. For the most part
nothing more than the bare maintenance of this existence itself,
extorted day by day with unceasing trouble and constant care in
the conflict with want, and with death in prospect. Everything
in life shows that earthly happiness is destined to be frustrated
or recognised as an illusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the
nature of things.

Accordingly the life of most men is troubled
and short. Those who are comparatively happy are so, for the
most part, only apparently, or else, like men of long life, they are
the rare exceptions, a possibility of which there had to be,—as
decoy-birds. Life presents itself as a continual deception in small
things as in great. If it has promised, it does not keep its word,
unless to show how little worth desiring were the things desired:[383]
thus we are deluded now by hope, now by what was hoped for.
If it has given, it did so in order to take. The enchantment of
distance shows us paradises which vanish like optical illusions
when we have allowed ourselves to be mocked by them. Happiness accordingly always lies in the future, or else in the past, and the present may be compared to a small dark cloud which
the wind drives over the sunny plain: before and behind it all
is bright, only it itself always casts a shadow. The present is
therefore always insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the
past irrevocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, little,
greater, and great misfortunes, with its deluded hopes and its
accidents destroying all our calculations, bears so distinctly the
impression of something with which we must become disgusted,
that it is hard to conceive how one has been able to mistake this
and allow oneself to be persuaded that life is there in order to
be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in order to be happy.
Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also the nature
of life throughout, presents itself to us as intended and calculated
to awaken the conviction that nothing at all is worth our striving,
our efforts and struggles, that all good things are vanity, the
world in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business which does not
cover its expenses;—so that our will may turn away from it.
The way in which this vanity of all objects of the will makes
itself known and comprehensible to the intellect which is rooted
in the individual, is primarily time. It is the form by means of
which that vanity of things appears as their perishableness; for on
account of this all our pleasures and joys disappear in our hands,
and we afterwards ask astonished where they have remained.
That nothingness itself is therefore the only objective element
in time, i.e., that which corresponds to it in the inner nature of
things, thus that of which it is the expression. Just on this account [384]
time is the a priori necessary form of all our perceptions; in it
everything must present itself, even we ourselves. Accordingly,
first of all, our life is like a payment which one receives in
nothing but copper pence, and yet must then give a discharge for:
the copper pence are the days; the discharge is death. For at last
time makes known the judgment of nature concerning the work
of all the beings which appear in it, in that it destroys them:—

“And rightly so, for all that arises
Is worthy only of being destroyed.
Hence were it better that nothing arose.”

Thus old age and death, to which every life necessarily hurries
on, are the sentence of condemnation on the will to live, coming
from the hands of nature itself, and which declares that this will
is an effort which frustrates itself. “What thou hast wished,” it
says, “ends thus: desire something better.” Hence the instruction
which his life affords to every one consists, as a whole, in this,
that the objects of his desires continually delude, waver, and fall,
and accordingly bring more misery than joy, till at last the whole
foundation upon which they all stand gives way, in that his life
itself is destroyed and so he receives the last proof that all his
striving and wishing was a perversity, a false path:—
“Then old age and experience, hand in hand,
Lead him to death, and make him understand,
After a search so painful and so long,
That all his life he has been in the wrong.”
We shall, however, enter into the details of the matter, for it is
in these views that I have met with most contradiction. First of
all, I have to confirm by the following remarks the proof given
in the text of the negative nature of all satisfaction, thus of all
pleasure and all happiness, in opposition to the positive nature of
pain.
We feel pain, but not painlessness; we feel care, but not the[385]
absence of care; fear, but not security. We feel the wish as we
feel hunger and thirst; but as soon as it has been fulfilled, it is like
the mouthful that has been taken, which ceases to exist for our
feeling the moment it is swallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss
painfully whenever they are wanting; but pains, even when they
cease after having long been present, are not directly missed, but
at the most are intentionally thought of by means of reflection.

For only pain and want can be felt positively, and therefore
announce themselves; well-being, on the other hand, is merely
negative. Therefore we do not become conscious of the three
greatest blessings of life, health, youth, and freedom, so long as
we possess them, but only after we have lost them; for they also
are negations. We only observe that days of our life were happy
after they have given place to unhappy ones. In proportion as
pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them decreases: what
is customary is no longer felt as a pleasure. Just in this way,
however, is the susceptibility for suffering increased, for the loss
of what we are accustomed to is painfully felt. Thus the measure
of what is necessary increases through possession, and thereby
the capacity for feeling pain. The hours pass the quicker the more
agreeably they are spent, and the slower the more painfully they
are spent; because pain, not pleasure, is the positive, the presence
of which makes itself felt. In the same way we become conscious
of time when we are bored, not when we are diverted. Both these
cases prove that our existence is most happy when we perceive it
least, from which it follows that it would be better not to have it.
Great and lively joy can only be conceived as the consequence
of great misery, which has preceded it; for nothing can be added
to a state of permanent satisfaction but some amusement, or the
satisfaction of vanity. Hence all poets are obliged to bring their
heroes into anxious and painful situations, so that they may be
able to free them from them. Dramas and Epics accordingly
always describe only fighting, suffering, tormented men; and [386]
every romance is a rareeshow in which we observe the spasms
and convulsions of the agonised human heart. Walter Scott has
naïvely expressed this æsthetic necessity in the conclusion to his
novel, “Old Mortality.” Voltaire, who was so highly favoured
both by nature and fortune, says, in entire agreement with the
truth proved by me: “Le bonheur n'est qu'un rève, et la dou-
leur est réelle.” And he adds: “Il y a quatre-vingts ans que je
l'éprouve. Je n'y sais autre chose que me résigner, et me dire
376 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
que les mouches sont nées pour être mangées par les araignées,
et les hommes pour être dévorés par les chagrins.”
Before so confidently affirming that life is a blessing worth
desiring or giving thanks for, let one compare calmly the sum
of the possible pleasures which a man can enjoy in his life with
the sum of the possible sorrows which may come to him in his
life. I believe the balance will not be hard to strike. At bottom,
however, it is quite superfluous to dispute whether there is more
good or evil in the world: for the mere existence of evil decides
the matter. For the evil can never be annulled, and consequently
can never be balanced by the good which may exist along with it
or after it.

“Mille piacer' non vagliono un tormento.”—Petr.
(A thousand pleasures are not worth one torment.)

For that a thousand had lived in happiness and pleasure would
never do away with the anguish and death-agony of a single one;
and just as little does my present well-being undo my past suf-
fering. If, therefore, the evils in the world were a hundred times
less than is the case, yet their mere existence would be sufficient
to establish a truth which may be expressed in different ways,
though always somewhat indirectly, the truth that we have not to
rejoice but rather to mourn at the existence of the world;—that
its non-existence would be preferable to its existence;—that it[387]
is something which at bottom ought not to be, &c., &c. Very
beautiful is Byron's expression of this truth:—
“Our life is a false nature,—'tis not in
The harmony of things, this hard decree,
This uneradicable taint of sin,
This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree

Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew—
Disease, death, bondage—all the woes we see—Chapter XLVI. On

And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.”
If the world and life were an end in themselves, and accord-
ingly required theoretically no justification and practically no
indemnification or compensation, but existed, for instance, as
Spinoza and the Spinozists of the present day represent it, as the
single manifestation of a God, who, animi causa, or else in order
to mirror himself, undertook such an evolution of himself; and
hence its existence neither required to be justified by reasons nor
redeemed by results;—then the sufferings and miseries of life
would not indeed have to be fully equalled by the pleasures and
well-being in it; for this, as has been said, is impossible, because
my present pain is never abolished by future joys, for the latter
fill their time as the former fills its time: but there would have to
be absolutely no suffering, and death also would either have not
to be, or else to have no terrors for us. Only thus would life pay
for itself.

<!-- 42 All that we lay hold of resists us because it has its own will, which must be
overcome. -->

But since now our state is rather something which had better
not be, everything about us bears the trace of this,—just as in hell
everything smells of sulphur—for everything is always imper-
fect and illusory, everything agreeable is displaced by something
disagreeable, every enjoyment is only a half one, every pleasure
introduces its own disturbance, every relief new difficulties, ev-
ery aid of our daily and hourly need leaves us each moment in
the lurch and denies its service, the step upon which we place
our foot so often gives way under us, nay, misfortunes great [388]
and small are the element of our life; and, in a word, we are
like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and made uneatable by
the harpies.42 Two remedies for this are tried: first, μ≈ª±≤μπ±,
i.e., prudence, foresight, cunning; it does not fully instruct us, is
insufficient, and leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity



which seeks to arm us against all misfortunes by preparedness
for everything and contempt of all: practically it becomes cynical
renunciation, which prefers once for all to reject all means of
relief and all alleviations—it reduces us to the position of dogs,
like Diogenes in his tub. The truth is, we ought to be wretched,
and we are so. The chief source of the serious evils which affect
men is man himself: homo homini lupus. Whoever keeps this last
fact clearly in view beholds the world as a hell, which surpasses
that of Dante in this respect, that one man must be the devil of
another. For this, one is certainly more fitted than another; an
arch-fiend, indeed, more fitted than all others, appearing in the
form of a conqueror, who places several hundred thousand men
opposite each other, and says to them: “To suffer and die is your
destiny; now shoot each other with guns and cannons,” and they
do so.
