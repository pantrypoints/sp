The conduct of men towards each other is characterised as a rule by injustice, extreme unfairness, hardness, nay, cruelty: an opposite course of conduct appears only as an exception. 

Upon this depends the necessity of the State and legislation, and upon none of your false pretences. But in all cases which do not lie within the reach of the law, that regardlessness of his like, peculiar to man, shows itself at once; a regardlessness which springs from his boundless egoism, and sometimes also from wickedness. 

How man deals with man is shown, for example, by negro slavery, the final end of which is sugar and coffee. But we do not need to go so far: at the age of five years to enter a cotton-spinning or other factory, and from that time forth to sit
there daily, first ten, then twelve, and ultimately fourteen hours, performing the same mechanical labour, is to purchase dearly the satisfaction of drawing breath. But this is the fate of millions,
and that of millions more is analogous to it.

We others, however, can be made perfectly miserable by trifling misfortunes; perfectly happy, not by the world. Whatever
one may say, the happiest moment of the happy man is the Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 379
moment of his falling asleep, and the unhappiest moment of the
unhappy that of his awaking. An indirect but certain proof of the
fact that men feel themselves unhappy, and consequently are so,
is also abundantly afforded by the fearful envy which dwells in
us all, and which in all relations of life, on the occasion of any
superiority, of whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot
contain its poison. Because they feel themselves unhappy, men
cannot endure the sight of one whom they imagine happy; he
who for the moment feels himself happy would like to make all
around him happy also, and says:

“Que tout le monde ici soit heureux de ma joie.”

If life were in itself a blessing to be prized, and decidedly to
be preferred to non-existence, the exit from it would not need to
be guarded by such fearful sentinels as death and its terrors. But
who would continue in life as it is if death were less terrible?
And again, who could even endure the thought of death if life
were a pleasure! But thus the former has still always this good,
that it is the end of life, and we console ourselves with regard to
the suffering of life with death, and with regard to death with the
suffering of life. The truth is, that the two inseparably belong to
each other, for together they constitute a deviation from the right
path, to return to which is as difficult as it is desirable.
If the world were not something which, expressed practically,
ought not to be, it would also not be theoretically a problem; [390]
but its existence would either require no explanation, inasmuch
as it would be so entirely self-evident that wonder concerning it
or a question about it could arise in no mind, or its end would
present itself unmistakably. Instead of this, however, it is indeed
an insoluble problem; for even the most perfect philosophy will
yet always contain an unexplained element, like an insoluble
deposit or the remainder which the irrational relation of two
quantities always leaves over. Therefore if one ventures to raise
the question why there is not rather nothing than this world, the world cannot be justified from itself, no ground, no final
cause of its existence can be found in itself, it cannot be shown
that it exists for its own sake, i.e., for its own advantage. In
accordance with my teaching, this can certainly be explained
from the fact that the principle of its existence is expressly one
which is without ground, a blind will to live, which as thing in
itself cannot be made subject to the principle of sufficient reason,
which is merely the form of the phenomenon, and through which
alone every why is justified. But this also agrees with the nature
of the world, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place
itself in the position in which we behold ourselves. A seeing will
would rather have soon made the calculation that the business
did not cover the cost, for such a mighty effort and struggle
with the straining of all the powers, under constant care, anxiety,
and want, and with the inevitable destruction of every individual
life, finds no compensation in the ephemeral existence itself,
which is so obtained, and which passes into nothing in our hands.
Hence, then, the explanation of the world from the Anaxagorean
Ωø≈¬, i.e., from a will accompanied by knowledge, necessarily
demands optimism to excuse it, which accordingly is set up and
maintained in spite of the loudly crying evidence of a whole
world full of misery. Life is there given out to be a gift, while it is
evident that every one would have declined such a gift if he could
have seen it and tested it beforehand; just as Lessing admired[391]
the understanding of his son, who, because he had absolutely
declined to enter life, had to be forcibly brought into it with the
forceps, but was scarcely there when he hurried away from it
again. On the other hand, it is then well said that life should be,
from one end to the other, only a lesson; to which, however, any
one might reply: “For this very reason I wish I had been left in
the peace of the all-sufficient nothing, where I would have had
no need of lessons or of anything else.” If indeed it should now
be added that he must one day give an account of every hour
of his life, he would be more justified in himself demanding an
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 381
account of why he had been transferred from that rest into such a
questionable, dark, anxious, and painful situation. To this, then,
we are led by false views. For human existence, far from bearing
the character of a gift, has entirely the character of a debt that has
been contracted. The calling in of this debt appears in the form
of the pressing wants, tormenting desires, and endless misery
established through this existence. As a rule, the whole lifetime
is devoted to the paying off of this debt; but this only meets the
interest. The payment of the capital takes place through death.

And when was this debt contracted? At the begetting.
Accordingly, if we regard man as a being whose existence
is a punishment and an expiation, we then view him in a right
light. The myth of the fall (although probably, like the whole
of Judaism, borrowed from the Zend-Avesta: Bundahish, 15),
is the only point in the Old Testament to which I can ascribe
metaphysical, although only allegorical, truth; indeed it is this
alone that reconciles me to the Old Testament. Our existence
resembles nothing so much as the consequence of a false step
and a guilty desire. New Testament Christianity, the ethical
spirit of which is that of Brahmanism and Buddhism, and is
therefore very foreign to the otherwise optimistic spirit of the
Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked itself on precisely [392]
to that myth: indeed, without this it would have found no point
of connection with Judaism at all. If any one desires to measure
the degree of guilt with which our existence is tainted, then let
him look at the suffering that is connected with it. Every great
pain, whether bodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for it
could not come to us if we did not deserve it. That Christianity
also regards our existence in this light is shown by a passage
in Luther's Commentary on Galatians, chap. 3, which I only
have beside me in Latin: “Sumus autem nos omnes corporibus et
rebus subjecti Diabolo, et hospites sumus in mundo, cujus ipse
princeps et Deus est. Ideo panis, quem edimus, potus, quem
bibimus, vestes, quibus utimur, imo aër et totum quo vivimus in
382 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
carne, sub ipsius imperio est.” An outcry has been made about
the melancholy and disconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it
lies merely in the fact that instead of inventing a future hell as the
equivalent of sin, I show that where guilt lies in the world there
is also already something akin to hell; but whoever is inclined to
deny this can easily experience it.

And to this world, to this scene of tormented and agonised
beings, who only continue to exist by devouring each other, in
which, therefore, every ravenous beast is the living grave of
thousands of others, and its self-maintenance is a chain of painful
deaths; and in which the capacity for feeling pain increases with
knowledge, and therefore reaches its highest degree in man, a
degree which is the higher the more intelligent the man is; to this
world it has been sought to apply the system of optimism, and
demonstrate to us that it is the best of all possible worlds. The
absurdity is glaring. But an optimist bids me open my eyes and
look at the world, how beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its
mountains and valleys, streams, plants, animals, &c. &c. Is the
world, then, a rareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful to
look at, but to be them is something quite different. Then comes
a teleologist, and praises to me the wise arrangement by virtue[393]
of which it is taken care that the planets do not run their heads
together, that land and sea do not get mixed into a pulp, but
are held so beautifully apart, also that everything is neither rigid
with continual frost nor roasted with heat; in the same way, that
in consequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no eternal
spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &c. &c. But
this and all like it are mere conditiones sine quibus non. If in
general there is to be a world at all, if its planets are to exist at
least as long as the light of a distant fixed star requires to reach
them, and are not, like Lessing's son, to depart again immediately
after birth, then certainly it must not be so clumsily constructed
that its very framework threatens to fall to pieces. But if one goes
on to the results of this applauded work, considers the players

who act upon the stage which is so durably constructed, and
now sees how with sensibility pain appears, and increases in
proportion as the sensibility develops to intelligence, and then
how, keeping pace with this, desire and suffering come out ever
more strongly, and increase till at last human life affords no other
material than this for tragedies and comedies, then whoever is
honest will scarcely be disposed to set up hallelujahs. David
Hume, in his “Natural History of Religion,” §§ 6, 7, 8, and 13,
has also exposed, mercilessly but with convincing truth, the real
though concealed source of these last. He also explains clearly
in the tenth and eleventh books of his “Dialogues on Natural
Religion,” with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of quite
a different kind from mine, the miserable nature of this world and
the untenableness of all optimism; in doing which he attacks this
in its origin. Both works of Hume's are as well worth reading as
they are unknown at the present day in Germany, where, on the
other hand, incredible pleasure is found, patriotically, in the most
disgusting nonsense of home-bred boastful mediocrities, who are
proclaimed great men. Hamann, however, translated these dia- [394]
logues; Kant went through the translation, and late in life wished
to induce Hamann's son to publish them because the translation
of Platner did not satisfy him (see Kant's biography by F. W.
Schubert, pp. 81 and 165). From every page of David Hume
there is more to be learned than from the collected philosophical
works of Hegel, Herbart, and Schleiermacher together.
The founder of systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz whose
philosophical merit I have no intention of denying although I
have never succeeded in thinking myself into the monadology,
pre-established harmony, and identitas indiscernibilium. His
“Nouveaux essays sur l'entendement” are, however, merely an
excerpt, with a full yet weak criticism, with a view to correction,
of Locke's work which is justly of world-wide reputation. He here
opposes Locke with just as little success as he opposes Newton
in the “Tentamen de motuum cœlestium causis,” directed against the system of gravitation. The “Critique of Pure Reason” is specially directed against this Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy, and has
a polemical, nay, a destructive relation to it, just as it is related to
Locke and Hume as a continuation and further construction. That
at the present day the professors of philosophy are on all sides en-
gaged in setting Leibnitz, with his juggling, upon his legs again,
nay, in glorifying him, and, on the other hand, in depreciating and
setting aside Kant as much as possible, has its sufficient reason in
the primum vivere; the “Critique of Pure Reason” does not admit
of one giving out Judaistic mythology as philosophy, nor of one
speaking, without ceremony, of the “soul” as a given reality, a
well-known and well-accredited person, without giving account
of how one arrived at this conception, and what justification one
has for using it scientifically. But primum vivere, deinde philo-
sophari! Down with Kant, vivat our Leibnitz! To return, then,
to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the Théodicée, as a methodical
and broad unfolding of optimism, any other merit than this, that
it gave occasion later for the immortal “Candide” of the great[395]
Voltaire; whereby certainly Leibnitz's often-repeated and lame
excuse for the evil of the world, that the bad sometimes brings
about the good, received a confirmation which was unexpected
by him. Even by the name of his hero Voltaire indicates that
it only requires sincerity to recognise the opposite of optimism.
Really upon this scene of sin, suffering, and death optimism
makes such an extraordinary figure that one would be forced to
regard it as irony if one had not a sufficient explanation of its
origin in the secret source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting
confidence in its success), which, as was mentioned above, is so
delightfully disclosed by Hume.
But indeed to the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz that
this is the best of all possible worlds, we may seriously and
honestly oppose the proof that it is the worst of all possible
worlds. For possible means, not what one may construct in
imagination, but what can actually exist and continue.
