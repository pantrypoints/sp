This world is so arranged as to be able to maintain itself with great difficulty; but if it were a little worse, it could no longer maintain itself. 

Consequently a worse world, since it could not continue
to exist, is absolutely impossible: thus this world itself is the
worst of all possible worlds. For not only if the planets were
to run their heads together, but even if any one of the actually
appearing perturbations of their course, instead of being gradu-
ally balanced by others, continued to increase, the world would
soon reach its end. Astronomers know upon what accidental
circumstances—principally the irrational relation to each other
of the periods of revolution—this depends, and have carefully
calculated that it will always go on well; consequently the world
also can continue and go on. We will hope that, although Newton
was of an opposite opinion, they have not miscalculated, and
consequently that the mechanical perpetual motion realised in
such a planetary system will not also, like the rest, ultimately
come to a standstill. 

Again, under the firm crust of the planet dwell the powerful forces of nature which, as soon as some
accident affords them free play, must necessarily destroy that
crust, with everything living upon it, as has already taken place
at least three times upon our planet, and will probably take place
oftener still. The earthquake of Lisbon, the earthquake of Haiti,
the destruction of Pompeii, are only small, playful hints of what
is possible. A small alteration of the atmosphere, which cannot
even be chemically proved, causes cholera, yellow fever, black
death, &c., which carry off millions of men; a somewhat greater
alteration would extinguish all life. A very moderate increase of
heat would dry up all the rivers and springs. The brutes have
received just barely so much in the way of organs and powers as
enables them to procure with the greatest exertion sustenance for
their own lives and food for their offspring; therefore if a brute
loses a limb, or even the full use of one, it must generally perish.

Even of the human race, powerful as are the weapons it possesses in understanding and reason, nine-tenths live in constant conflict with want, always balancing themselves with difficulty
and effort upon the brink of destruction. Thus throughout, as for
the continuance of the whole, so also for that of each individual
being the conditions are barely and scantily given, but nothing
over. The individual life is a ceaseless battle for existence itself;
while at every step destruction threatens it. Just because this
threat is so often fulfilled provision had to be made, by means
of the enormous excess of the germs, that the destruction of
the individuals should not involve that of the species, for which
alone nature really cares. The world is therefore as bad as it
possibly can be if it is to continue to be at all. Q. E. D. The fossils
of the entirely different kinds of animal species which formerly
inhabited the planet afford us, as a proof of our calculation,
the records of worlds the continuance of which was no longer
possible, and which consequently were somewhat worse than[397]
the worst of possible worlds.

Optimism is at bottom the unmerited self-praise of the real
originator of the world, the will to live, which views itself complacently in its works; and accordingly it is not only a false, but also a pernicious doctrine. For it presents life to us as a
desirable condition, and the happiness of man as the end of it.
Starting from this, every one then believes that he has the most
just claim to happiness and pleasure; and if, as is wont to happen,
these do not fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged,
nay, that he loses the end of his existence; while it is far more
correct to regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, crowned
by death, as the end of our life (as Brahmanism and Buddhism,
and also genuine Christianity do); for it is these which lead to
the denial of the will to live. In the New Testament the world
is represented as a valley of tears, life as a process of purifying
or refining, and the symbol of Christianity is an instrument of
torture. Therefore, when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke,
and Pope brought forward optimism, the general offence which
it gave depended principally upon the fact that optimism is irreconcilable with Christianity; as Voltaire states and explains in the preface to his excellent poem, “Le désastre de Lisbonne,” which is also expressly directed against optimism. This great
man, whom I so gladly praise, in opposition to the abuse of venal
German ink-slingers, is placed decidedly higher than Rousseau
by the insight to which he attained in three respects, and which
prove the greater depth of his thinking: (1) the recognition of
the preponderating magnitude of the evil and misery of existence
with which he is deeply penetrated; (2) that of the strict necessity
of the acts of will; (3) that of the truth of Locke's principle,
that what thinks may also be material: while Rousseau opposes
all this with declamations in his “Profession de foi du vicaire
Savoyard,” a superficial Protestant pastor's philosophy; as he
also in the same spirit attacks the beautiful poem of Voltaire [398]
which has just been referred to with ill-founded, shallow, and
logically false reasoning, in the interests of optimism, in his long
letter to Voltaire of 18th August 1756, which is devoted simply
to this purpose. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic and the
¿¡…ƒøΩ »μ≈¥ø¬ of Rousseau's whole philosophy is this, that in
the place of the Christian doctrine of original sin, and the original
depravity of the human race, he puts an original goodness and
unlimited perfectibility of it, which has only been led astray by
civilisation and its consequences, and then founds upon this his
optimism and humanism.
As in “Candide” Voltaire wages war in his facetious manner
against optimism, Byron has also done so in his serious and tragic
style, in his immortal masterpiece, “Cain,” on account of which
he also has been honoured with the invectives of the obscurantist,
Friedrich Schlegel. If now, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I
were to give what has been said by great men of all ages in this
anti-optimistic spirit, there would be no end to the quotations, for
almost every one of them has expressed in strong language his
knowledge of the misery of this world. 

Thus, not to confirm, but
merely to embellish this chapter, a few quotations of this kind may be given at the end of it.
First of all, let me mention here that the Greeks, far as they
were from the Christian and lofty Asiatic conception of the world,
and although they decidedly stood at the point of view of the as-
sertion of the will, were yet deeply affected by the wretchedness
of existence. This is shown even by the invention of tragedy,
which belongs to them. Another proof of it is afforded us by the
custom of the Thracians, which is first mentioned by Herodotus,
though often referred to afterwards—the custom of welcoming
the new-born child with lamentations, and recounting all the evils
which now lie before it; and, on the other hand, burying the dead
with mirth and jesting, because they are no longer exposed to so
many and great sufferings. In a beautiful poem preserved for us[399]
by Plutarch (De audiend. poët. in fine) this runs thus:—
“§øΩ ∆≈Ωƒ± ∏¡∑ΩμπΩ, μπ¬ A√Ω μ¡«μƒ±π ∫±∫±
§øΩ ¥Ω±≈ ∏±ΩøΩƒ± ∫±π ¿øΩ…Ω ¿μ¿±≈ºμΩøΩ
ß±π¡øΩƒ±¬ μ≈∆∑ºø≈Ωƒ±¬ μ∫¿μº¿μπΩ ¥øº…Ω.”
(Lugere genitum, tanta qui intrarit mala:
At morte si quis finiisset miserias,
Hunc laude amicos atque lætitia exsequi.)
It is not to be attributed to historical relationship, but to the
moral identity of the matter, that the Mexicans welcomed the
new-born child with the words, “My child, thou art born to en-
dure; therefore endure, suffer, and keep silence.” And, following
the same feeling, Swift (as Walter Scott relates in his Life of
Swift) early adopted the custom of keeping his birthday not as a
time of joy but of sadness, and of reading on that day the passage
of the Bible in which Job laments and curses the day on which it
was said in the house of his father a man-child is born.
Well known and too long for quotation is the passage in
the “Apology of Socrates,” in which Plato makes this wisest of
mortals say that death, even if it deprives us of consciousness for ever, would be a wonderful gain, for a deep, dreamless sleep
every day is to be preferred even to the happiest life.
A saying of Heraclitus runs: “§Û ø≈Ω ≤πÛ øΩøº± ºμΩ ≤πø¬,
μ¡≥øΩ ¥μ ∏±Ω±ƒø¬.” (Vitæ nomen quidem est vita, opus autem
mors. Etymologicum magnum, voce íπø¬; also Eustath. ad Iliad.,
i. p. 31.)

The beautiful lines of the “Theogony” are famous:—

<!-- “ë¡«∑Ω ºμΩ º∑ ∆≈Ω±π μ¿π«∏øΩπøπ√πΩ ±¡π√ƒøΩ,
ú∑¥Ω μπ√π¥μπΩ ±≈≥±¬ øæμø¬ !μªπø≈;

ö±π ∫μπ√∏±π ¿øªª∑Ω ≥∑Ω μ¿±º∑√±ºμΩøΩ.”
(Optima sors homini natum non esse, nec unquam.
Adspexisse diem, flammiferumque jubar.
Altera jam genitum demitti protinus Orco,
Et pressum multa mergere corpus humo.) -->


Sophocles, in “Œdipus Colonus” (1225), has the following abbreviation of the same:

<!-- “ú∑ ∆≈Ω±π ƒøΩ ¿±Ωƒ± Ωπ∫±
ªø≥øΩ; ƒø ¥Ω μ¿μπ ∆±Ω√,
≤∑Ω±π ∫μπ∏μΩ, A∏μΩ ¿μ¡ !∫μπ,
¿øª≈ ¥μ≈ƒμ¡øΩ, a¬ ƒ±«π√ƒ±.”
(Natum non esse sortes vincit alias omnes: proxima autem
est, ubi quis in lucem editus fuerit, eodem redire, unde venit,
quam ocissime.) -->

Euripides says:

<!-- “†±¬ ¥Ωø¥≈Ω∑¡ø¬ ≤πø¬ ±Ω∏¡…¿…Ω,
öΩø≈∫ μ√ƒπ ¿øΩ…Ω ±Ω±¿±≈√π¬.”
(Omnis hominum vita est plena dolore,
Nec datur laborum remissio.)


—HIPPOL, 189. -->

And Homer already said:—

<!-- “ü≈ ºμΩ ≥±¡ ƒπ μ√ƒπΩ ø ∂≈¡…ƒμ¡øΩ ±Ω¥¡ø¬
†±Ωƒ…Ω, A√√± ¥μ ≥±π±Ω μ¿π ¿Ωμμπ ƒμ ∫±π ¡¿μπ.”
(Non enim quidquam alicubi est calamitosius homine
Omnium, quotquot super terram spirantque et moventur.)
—II. xvii. 446. -->

Even Pliny says: “Quapropter hoc primum quisque in remediis
animi sui habeat, ex omnibus bonis, quæ homini natura tribuit,
nullum melius esse tempestiva morte” (Hist. Nat. 28, 2).
Shakspeare puts the words in the mouth of the old king Henry
IV.:—
“O heaven! that one might read the book of fate,
And see the revolution of the times,
... how chances mock,
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
The happiest youth,—viewing his progress through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,—
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.”

Finally, Byron:—
“Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
And know, whatever thou hast been,
'Tis something better not to be.”

Baltazar Gracian also brings the misery of our existence before
our eyes in the darkest colours in the “Criticon,” Parte i., Crisi 5,
just at the beginning, and Crisi 7 at the end, where he explicitly
represents life as a tragic farce.

Yet no one has so thoroughly and exhaustively handled this
subject as, in our own day, Leopardi. He is entirely filled
and penetrated by it: his theme is everywhere the mockery and
wretchedness of this existence; he presents it upon every page of
his works, yet in such a multiplicity of forms and applications,
with such wealth of imagery that he never wearies us, but, on the
contrary, is throughout entertaining and exciting.
