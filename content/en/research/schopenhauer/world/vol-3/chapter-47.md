This chapter is connected with §§ 55, 62, 67 of the first volume.

Here is the great gap which occurs in these supplements, on account of the circumstance that I have already dealt with moral
philosophy in the narrower sense in the two prize essays published
under the title, “Die Grundprobleme der Ethik,” an acquaintance
with which is assumed, as I have said, in order to avoid useless
repetition. 

Therefore there only remains for me here a small
gleaning of isolated reflections which could not be discussed in
that work, the contents of which were, in the main, prescribed
by the Academies; least of all those reflections which demand a
higher point of view than that which is common to all, and which
I was there obliged to adhere to. Accordingly it will not surprise
the reader to find these reflections here in a very fragmentary
collection. This collection again has been continued in the eighth
and ninth chapters of the second volume of the Parerga.

That moral investigations are incomparably more difficult
than physical, and in general than any others, results from the
fact that they are almost immediately concerned with the thing
in itself, namely, with that manifestation of it in which, directly
discovered by the light of knowledge, it reveals its nature as will.

Physical truths, on the other hand, remain entirely in the province
of the idea, i.e., of the phenomenon, and merely show how the
lowest manifestations of the will present themselves in the idea
in conformity to law. Further, the consideration of the world[403]
from the physical side, however far and successfully it may be
pursued, is in its results without any consolation for us: on the
moral side alone is consolation to be found; for here the depths
of our own inner nature disclose themselves to the consideration.
But my philosophy is the only one which confers upon ethics
its complete and whole rights; for only if the true nature of man
is his own will, and consequently he is, in the strictest sense, his own work, are his deeds really entirely his and to be ascribed to him. 

On the other hand, whenever he has another origin, or is
the work of a being different from himself, all his guilt falls back
upon this origin, or originator. For operari sequitur esse.

To connect the force which produces the phenomenon of the
world, and consequently determines its nature, with the morality
of the disposition or character, and thus to establish a moral
order of the world as the foundation of the physical,—this has
been since Socrates the problem of philosophy. Theism solved it
in a childish manner, which could not satisfy mature humanity.

Therefore pantheism opposed itself to it whenever it ventured to
do so, and showed that nature bears in itself the power by virtue
of which it appears. With this, however, ethics had necessarily
to be given up. Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and there to
preserve it by means of sophistry, but for the most part gives it up
altogether, and, with a boldness which excites astonishment and
repugnance, explains the distinction between right and wrong,
and in general between good and evil, as merely conventional,
thus in itself empty (for example, Eth. iv., prop. 37, schol. 

2. After having met with unmerited neglect for more than a hundred
years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much esteemed in this
century through the reaction caused by the swing of the pendulum
of opinion. All pantheism must ultimately be overthrown by the
inevitable demands of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering
of the world. If the world is a theophany, then all that man, or
even the brute, does is equally divine and excellent; nothing can be censurable, and nothing more praiseworthy than the rest:
thus there is no ethics. 

Hence, in consequence of the revived
Spinozism of our own day, thus of pantheism, the treatment of
ethics has sunk so low and become so shallow that it has been
made a mere instruction as to the proper life of a citizen and a
member of a family, in which the ultimate end of human existence
is supposed to consist: thus in methodical, complete, smug, and
comfortable philistinism. Pantheism, indeed, has only led to such shallow vulgarisms through the fact that (by a shameful misuse of the e quovis ligno fit Mercurius) a common mind, Hegel, has, by
the well-known means, been falsely stamped as a great philosopher, and a herd of his disciples, at first suborned, afterwards
only stupid, received his weighty words. Such outrages on the
human mind do not remain unpunished: the seed has sprouted.

In the same spirit it was then asserted that ethics should have for
its material not the conduct of individuals, but that of nations,
that this alone was a theme worthy of it. Nothing can be more
perverse than this view, which rests on the most vulgar realism.
For in every individual appears the whole undivided will to live,
the thing in itself, and the microcosm is like the macrocosm.
The masses have no more content than each individual. Ethics is
concerned not with actions and their results, but with willing, and
willing itself takes place only in the individual. 

Not the fate of
nations, which exists only in the phenomenon, but that of the individual is decided morally. Nations are really mere abstractions; individuals alone actually exist. Thus, then, is pantheism related
to ethics. But the evil and misery of the world are not in accord
even with theism; hence it sought assistance from all kinds of
evasions, theodicies, which yet were irretrievably overthrown
by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pantheism, however,
is completely untenable in the presence of that bad side of the
world. Only when the world is regarded entirely from without[405]
and from the physical side alone, and nothing else is kept in view
but the constant restorative order, and the comparative imperish-
ableness of the whole which is thereby introduced, is it perhaps
possible to explain it as a god, yet always only symbolically. But
if one enters within, thus considers also the subjective and moral
side, with its preponderance of want, suffering, and misery, of
dissension, wickedness, madness, and perversity, then one soon
becomes conscious with horror that the last thing imaginable one
has before one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and
especially in my work “Ueber den Willen in der Natur” have proved, that the force which works and acts in nature is identical
with the will in us. Thereby the moral order of the world is
brought into direct connection with the force which produces
the phenomenon of the world. For the phenomenon of the will
must exactly correspond to its nature. Upon this depends the
exposition of eternal justice given in §§ 63 and 64 of the first
volume, and the world, although subsisting by its own power,
receives throughout a moral tendency. Accordingly the problem
which has been discussed from the time of Socrates is now for
the first time really solved, and the demand of thinking reason
directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I have never professed to
propound a philosophy which leaves no questions unanswered.

In this sense philosophy is really impossible: it would be the
science of omniscience. But est quadam prodire tenus, si non
datur ultra: there is a limit to which reflection can penetrate and
can so far lighten the night of our existence, although the horizon
always remains dark. My doctrine reaches this limit in the will to
live, which in its own manifestation asserts or denies itself. To
wish, however, to go beyond this is, in my eyes, like wishing to
fly beyond the atmosphere. We must stop there; even although
new problems arise out of those which have been solved. Besides
this, however, we must refer to the fact that the validity of the [406]
principle of sufficient reason is limited to the phenomenon; this
was the theme of my first essay on that principle, which was
published as early as 1813.

I now go on to supplement particular points, and shall begin
by supporting, with two passages from classical poetry, my ex-
planation of weeping given in § 67 of the first volume, that it
springs from sympathy the object of which is one's own self.
At the end of the eighth book of the “Odyssey,” Ulysses, who
in all his many sorrows is never represented as weeping, bursts
into tears, when, still unknown, he hears his early heroic life
and deeds sung by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the
Phæacian king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of his life contrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not this
itself directly, but the objective consideration of it, the picture
of his present summoned up by his past, calls forth his tears;
he feels sympathy with himself. Euripides makes the innocently
condemned Hypolytus, bemoaning his own fate, express the
same feeling:

(Heu, si liceret mihi, me ipsum extrinsecus spectare, quanto-
pere deflerem mala, quæ patior.)

Finally, as a proof of my explanation, an anecdote may be
given here which I take from the English journal The Herald of
the 16th July 1836. A client, when he had heard his case set forth
by his counsel in court, burst into a flood of tears, and cried,
“I never knew I had suffered half so much till I heard it here
to-day.”
