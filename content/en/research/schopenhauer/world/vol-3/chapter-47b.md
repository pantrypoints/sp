I have shown in § 55 of the first volume how, notwithstanding
the unalterable nature of the character, i.e., of the special fundamental will of a man, a real moral repentance is yet possible. I wish, however, to add the following explanation, which I must
preface by a few definitions. Inclination is every strong susceptibility of the will for motives of a certain kind. 

Passion is an
inclination so strong that the motives which excite it exercise a[407]
power over the will, which is stronger than that of every possible
motive that can oppose them; thus its mastery over the will
becomes absolute, and consequently with reference to it the will
is passive or suffering. It must, however, be remarked here that
passions seldom reach the degree at which they fully answer to
the definition, but rather bear their name as mere approximations
to it: therefore there are then still counter-motives which are able
at least to restrict their effect, if only they appear distinctly in
consciousness. 

The emotion is just as irresistible, but yet only a passing excitement of the will, by a motive which receives its power, not from a deeply rooted inclination, but merely from
the fact that, appearing suddenly, it excludes for the moment
the counter-effect of all other motives, for it consists of an idea,
which completely obscures all others by its excessive vividness,
or, as it were, conceals them entirely by its too close proximity,
so that they cannot enter consciousness and act on the will,
whereby, therefore, the capacity for reflection, and with it intellectual freedom, is to a certain extent abolished. 
Accordingly the emotion is related to the passion as delirium to madness.
Moral repentance is now conditioned by the fact that before
the act the inclination to it did not leave the intellect free scope,
because it did not allow it to contemplate clearly and fully the
counter-motives, but rather turned it ever anew to the motives
in its own favour. But now, after the act has been performed,
these motives are, by this itself, neutralised, and consequently
have become ineffective. Now reality brings before the intellect
the counter-motives as the consequences of the act which have
already appeared; and the intellect now knows that they would
have been the stronger if it had only adequately contemplated and
weighed them. Thus the man becomes conscious that he has done
what was really not in accordance with his will. 

This knowledge is repentance, for he has not acted with full intellectual freedom;
for all the motives did not attain to efficiency. What excluded the motives opposed to the action was in the case of the hasty
action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate action the passion. It has also often depended upon the circumstance that his reason certainly presented to him the counter-motives in the
abstract, but was not supported by a sufficiently strong imagination to present to him their whole content and true significance in images. 

Examples of what has been said are the cases in
which revenge, jealousy, or avarice have led to murder. 

After it
is committed they are extinguished, and now justice, sympathy,
the remembrance of former friendship, raise their voices and say all that they would have said before if they had been allowed
to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, which says, “If it
were not done it would never happen.” An incomparable rep-
resentation of this is afforded by the old Scottish ballad, which
has also been translated by Herder, “Edward, Edward.” 

In an analogous manner, the neglect of one's own good may occasion
an egotistical repentance. For example, when an otherwise unadvisable marriage is concluded in consequence of passionate love,
which now is extinguished just by the marriage, and for the first
time the counter-motives of personal interest, lost independence,
&c., &c., come into consciousness, and speak as they would have spoken before if they had been allowed utterance. 

All such
actions accordingly spring from a relative weakness of intellect,
because it lets itself be mastered by the will, just where its func-
tion as the presenter of motives ought to have been inexorably
fulfilled, without allowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The
vehemence of the will is here only indirectly the cause, in that
it interferes with the intellect, and thereby prepares for itself
repentance. The reasonableness of the character √…∆¡ø√≈Ω∑,
which is opposed to passionateness, really consists in this, that
the will never overpowers the intellect to such an extent as to
prevent it from correctly exercising its function of the distinct,
full, and clear exposition of the motives in the abstract for the[409]
reason, in the concrete for the imagination. Now this may just
as well depend upon the moderation and mildness of the will
as upon the strength of the intellect. All that is required is that
the latter should be relatively strong enough for the will that is
present, thus that the two should stand in a suitable relation to
each other.

The following explanations have still to be added to the fun-
damental characteristics of the philosophy of law expounded in
§ 62 of the first volume, and also in my prize essay on the
foundation of morals, § 17.

Those who, with Spinoza, deny that there is a right apart from the State, confound the means for enforcing the right with the
right itself. Certainly the right is insured protection only in the
State. But it itself exists independently of the State. For by force
it can only be suppressed, never abolished. Accordingly the State
is nothing more than an institution for protection, which has
become necessary through the manifold attacks to which man is
exposed, and which he would not be able to ward off alone, but
only in union with others. 

So, then, the aims of the State are:

1. First of all, outward protection, which may just as well become needful against lifeless forces of nature or wild beasts
as against men, consequently against other nations; although this
case is the most frequent and important, for the worst enemy
of man is man: homo homini lupus. 

Since, in consequence of
this aim, nations always set up the principle, in words if not
with deeds, that they wish to stand to each other in a purely
defensive, never in an aggressive relation, they recognise the law
of nations. This is at bottom nothing but natural law, in the only
sphere of its practical activity that remains to it, between nation
and nation, where it alone must reign, because its stronger son,
positive law, cannot assert itself, since it requires a judge and an
executive. Accordingly the law of nations consists of a certain
degree of morality in the dealings of nations with each other, the
maintenance of which is a question of honour for mankind. The [410]
bar at which cases based on this law are tried is that of public opinion.

2. Protection within, thus protection of the members of a State against each other, consequently security of private right,
by means of the maintenance of an honest state of things, which
consists in this, that the concentrated forces of all protect each
individual, from which arises an appearance as if all were honest,
i.e., just, thus as if no one wished to injure the others.

But, as is always the way in human affairs, the removal of one
evil generally opens the way for a new one; thus the granting
of that double protection introduces the need of a third, namely:

3. Protection against the protector, i.e., against him or those to whom the society has transferred the management of the protection, thus the guarantee of public right. 

This appears most
completely attainable by dividing and separating from each other
the threefold unity of the protective power, thus the legislature,
the judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by
others, and independently of the rest. The great value, indeed
the fundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me to lie in the
fact that because men remain men one must be placed so high,
and so much power, wealth, security, and absolute inviolability
given him that there remains nothing for him to desire, to hope,
and to fear for himself; whereby the egoism which dwells in
him, as in every one, is annihilated, as it were, by neutralisation,
and he is now able, as if he were no longer a man, to practise
justice, and to keep in view no longer his own but only the
public good. This is the source of the seemingly superhuman
nature that everywhere accompanies royalty, and distinguishes it
so infinitely from the mere presidency. Therefore it must also be
hereditary, not elective; partly in order that no one may see his
equal in the king; partly that the king himself may only be able to
provide for his successors by caring for the welfare of the State,
which is absolutely one with that of his family.[411]

If other ends besides that of protection, here explained, are
ascribed to the State, this may easily endanger the true end.
According to my explanation, the right of property arises only
through the expenditure of labour upon things. This truth, which
has already often been expressed, finds a noteworthy confirma-
tion in the fact that it is asserted, even in a practical regard,
in a declaration of the American ex-president, Quincey Adams,
which is to be found in the Quarterly Review of 1840, No. 130;
and also in French, in the “Bibliothèque universelle de Genêve,”
July 1840, No. 55. I will give it here in German (English of
Quarterly Review): “There are moralists who have questioned
the right of the Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the aboriginals in any case, and under any limitations whatsoever; 

But have they maturely considered the whole subject? The Indian
right of possession itself stands, with regard to the greatest part
of the country, upon a questionable foundation. 

Their cultivated
fields, their constructed habitations, a space of ample sufficiency
for their subsistence, and whatever they had annexed of them-
selves by personal labour, was undoubtedly by the laws of nature
theirs. But what is the right of a huntsman to the forest of a
thousand miles over which he has accidentally ranged in quest
of prey?” &c.
