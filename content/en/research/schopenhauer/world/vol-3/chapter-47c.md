In the same way, those who in our own day
have seen occasion to combat communism with reasons (for
example, the Archbishop of Paris, in his pastoral of June 1851)
have always brought forward the argument that property is the
result of work, as it were only embodied work. This is further
evidence that the right of property can only be established by the
application of work to things, for only in this respect does it find
free recognition and make itself morally valid.

An entirely different kind of proof of the same truth is afforded
by the moral fact that while the law punishes poaching just as
severely as theft, and in many countries more severely, yet civil
honour, which is irrevocably lost by the latter, is really not [412]
affected by the former; but the poacher, if he has been guilty
of nothing else, is certainly tainted with a fault, but yet is not
regarded, like the thief, as dishonourable and shunned by all.
For the principles of civil honour rest upon moral and not upon
mere positive law; but game is not an object upon which labour
is bestowed, and thus also is not an object of a morally valid
possession: the right to it is therefore entirely a positive one, and
is not morally recognised.

According to my view, the principle ought to lie at the basis
of criminal law that it is not really the man but only the deed
which is punished, in order that it may not recur. The criminal is
merely the subject in whom the deed is punished, in order that
the law in consequence of which the punishment is inflicted may retain its deterrent power. This is the meaning of the expression, “He is forfeited to the law.” According to Kant's explanation,
which amounts to a jus talionis, it is not the deed but the man
that is punished. 

The penitentiary system also seeks not so much
to punish the deed as the man, in order to reform him. It thereby
sets aside the real aim of punishment, determent from the deed,
in order to attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it
is always a doubtful thing to attempt to attain two different ends
by one means: how much more so if the two are in any sense
opposite ends. Education is a benefit, punishment ought to be
an evil; the penitentiary prison is supposed to accomplish both
at once. Moreover, however large a share untutored ignorance,
combined with outward distress, may have in many crimes, yet
we dare not regard these as their principal cause, for innumer-
able persons living in the same ignorance and under absolutely
similar circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the substance of
the matter falls back upon the personal, moral character; but this,
as I have shown in my prize essay on the freedom of the will, is
absolutely unalterable. Therefore moral reformation is really not
possible, but only determent from the deed through fear. At the[413]
same time, the correction of knowledge and the awakening of
the desire to work can certainly be attained; it will appear what
effect this can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from the
aim of punishment set forth in the text, that, when possible, the
apparent severity of the punishment should exceed the actual: but
solitary confinement achieves the reverse. Its great severity has
no witnesses, and is by no means anticipated by any one who has
not experienced it; thus it does not deter. It threatens him who is
tempted to crime by want and misery with the opposite pole of
human suffering, ennui: but, as Goethe rightly observes—
“When real affliction is our lot,
Then do we long for ennui.”

The contemplation of it will deter him just as little as the sight
of the palatial prisons which are built by honest men for rogues.
If, however, it is desired that these penitentiary prisons should
be regarded as educational institutions, then it is to be regretted
that the entrance to them is only obtained by crimes, instead of
which it ought to have preceded them.

That punishment, as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear a
proper proportion to the crime does not depend upon the fact that
it would be an expiation of it, but rather on the fact that the pledge
ought to be proportionate to the value of that for which it answers.
Therefore every one is justified in demanding the pledge of the
life of another as a guarantee for the security of his own life, but
not for the security of his property, for which the freedom, and so
forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the security of the life of
the citizens capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary.

Those who wish to abolish it should be answered, “First remove
murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to
follow.” It ought also to be inflicted for the clear attempt to
murder just as for murder itself; for the law desires to punish the [414]
deed, not to revenge its consequences. In general the injury to
be guarded against affords the right measure for the punishment
which is to be threatened, but it does not give the moral baseness
of the forbidden action. Therefore the law may rightly impose
the punishment of imprisonment for allowing a flower-pot to fall
from a window, or impose hard labour for smoking in the woods
during the summer, and yet permit it in the winter. But to impose
the punishment of death, as in Poland, for shooting an ure-ox is
too much, for the maintenance of the species of ure-oxen may
not be purchased with human life. In determining the measure
of the punishment, along with the magnitude of the injury to be
guarded against, we have to consider the strength of the motives
which impel to the forbidden action. Quite a different standard
of punishment would be established if expiation, retribution, jus
talionis, were its true ground. But the criminal code ought to be nothing but a register of counter-motives for possible criminal actions: therefore each of these motives must decidedly outweigh
the motives which lead to these actions, and indeed so much the
more the greater the evil is which would arise from the action
to be guarded against, the stronger the temptation to it, and the
more difficult the conviction of the criminal;—always under the
correct assumption that the will is not free, but determinable by
motives;—apart from this it could not be got at at all. So much
for the philosophy of law.

In my prize essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 seq.)
I have proved the originality and unalterableness of the inborn
character, from which the moral content of the course of life
proceeds. It is established as a fact. But in order to understand
problems in their full extent it is sometimes necessary to oppose
opposites sharply to each other. In this case, then, let one recall
how incredibly great is the inborn difference between man and
man, in a moral and in an intellectual regard. Here nobleness and
wisdom; there wickedness and stupidity. In one the goodness[415]
of the heart shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of genius is
enthroned in his countenance. The base physiognomy of another
is the impression of moral worthlessness and intellectual dulness,
imprinted by the hands of nature itself, unmistakable and inerad-
icable; he looks as if he must be ashamed of existence. But to
this outward appearance the inner being really corresponds. We
cannot possibly assume that such differences, which transform
the whole being of the man, and which nothing can abolish,
which, further, in conflict with his circumstances, determine his
course of life, could exist without guilt or merit on the part of
those affected by them, and be merely the work of chance. Even
from this it is evident that the man must be in a certain sense his
own work. But now, on the other hand, we can show the source
of these differences empirically in the nature of the parents; and
besides this, the meeting and connection of these parents has
clearly been the work of the most accidental circumstances. 

By such considerations, then, we are forcibly directed to the distinc-
tion between the phenomenon and the true being of things, which
alone can contain the solution of that problem. The thing in itself
only reveals itself by means of the forms of the phenomenon;
therefore what proceeds from the thing in itself must yet appear
in those forms, thus also in the bonds of causality. Accordingly it
will present itself to us here as a mysterious and incomprehensible
guidance of things, of which the external empirical connection
would be the mere tool. Yet all that happens appears in this
empirical connection introduced by causes, thus necessarily and
determined from without, while its true ground lies in the inner
nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly we can here see
the solution of the problem only from afar, and when we reflect
upon it we fall into an abyss of thought—as Hamlet very truly
says, “thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls.” In my essay in
the first volume of the Parerga “On the Appearance of Intention [416]
in the Fate of Individuals” I have set forth my thoughts upon this
mysterious guidance of things, a guidance which indeed can only
be conceived symbolically.

In § 14 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals there
will be found an exposition of egoism, as regards its nature; and
the following attempt to discover its root may be looked upon
as supplementary to that paragraph. Nature itself contradicts
itself directly, according as it speaks from the individual or the
universal, from within or from without, from the centre or the
periphery. It has its centre in every individual; for each individual
is the whole will to live. Therefore, even if this individual is only
an insect or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it thus: “I alone am
all in all: in my maintenance everything is involved; the rest may
perish, it is really nothing.” So speaks nature from the particular
standpoint, thus from the point of view of self-consciousness,
and upon this depends the egoism of every living thing. 

On the
other hand, from the universal point of view,—which is that of
the consciousness of other things, that of objective knowledge, which for the moment looks away from the individual with
whom the knowledge is connected,—from without then, from
the periphery nature speaks thus: “The individual is nothing, and
less than nothing. I destroy millions of individuals every day, for
sport and pastime: I abandon their fate to the most capricious and
wilful of my children, chance, who harasses them at pleasure.
I produce millions of new individuals every day, without any
diminution of my productive power; just as little as the power of a
mirror is exhausted by the number of reflections of the sun, which
it casts on the wall one after another. The individual is nothing.”
Only he who knows how to really reconcile and eliminate this
patent contradiction of nature has a true answer to the question
as to the perishableness and imperishableness of his own self. I
believe I have given, in the first four chapters of this fourth book[417]
of the supplements, an adequate introduction to such knowledge.
What is said above may further be illustrated in the following
manner. Every individual, when he looks within, recognises
in his nature, which is his will, the thing in itself, therefore
that which everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives
himself as the kernel and centre of the world, and regards himself
as of infinite importance. If, on the other hand, he looks without,
then he is in the province of the idea the mere phenomenon,
where he sees himself as an individual among an infinite number
of other individuals, accordingly as something very insignificant,
nay, vanishing altogether. Consequently every individual, even
the most insignificant, every I, when regarded from within, is all
in all; regarded from without, on the other hand, he is nothing,
or at least as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great
difference between what each one necessarily is in his own eyes
and what he is in the eyes of others, consequently the egoism
with which every one reproaches every one else.

In consequence of this egoism our fundamental error of all is
this, that with reference to each other we are reciprocally not I.

On the other hand, to be just, noble, and benevolent is nothing else than to translate my metaphysics into actions. To say that time and space are mere forms of our knowledge, not conditions
of things in themselves, is the same as to say that the doctrine of
metempsychosis, “Thou shalt one day be born as him whom thou
now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like injury,” is identical
with the formula of the Brahmans, which has frequently been
mentioned, Tat twam asi, “This thou art.” All true virtue proceeds
from the immediate and intuitive knowledge of the metaphysical
identity of all beings, which I have frequently shown, especially
in § 22 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals. But just
on this account it is not the result of a special pre-eminence of
intellect; on the contrary, even the weakest intellect is sufficient
to see through the principium individuationis, which is what is [418]
required in this matter. Accordingly we may find the most ex-
cellent character even in the case of a very weak understanding.
And further, the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied by
no exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the requisite
penetration of the principium individuationis would be present
in every one if it were not that the will opposes this, and by
virtue of its immediate mysterious and despotic influence upon
the intellect generally prevents it from arising; so that ultimately
all guilt falls back upon the will, as indeed is in conformity with
the fact.

The doctrine of metempsychosis, touched on above, deviates
from the truth merely through the circumstance that it transfers
to the future what already is now. It makes my true inner nature
exist in others only after my death, while, according to the truth,
it already lives in them now, and death merely removes the
illusion on account of which I am not aware of this; just as an
innumerable host of stars constantly shine above our heads, but
only become visible to us when the one sun near the earth has set.

From this point of view my individual existence, however much,
like that sun, it may outshine everything, appears ultimately only
as a hindrance which stands between me and the knowledge of the true extent of my being. And because every individual, in his
knowledge, is subject to this hindrance, it is just individuation
that keeps the will to live in error as to its own nature; it is the
Mâyâ of Brahmanism. Death is a refutation of this error, and
abolishes it. I believe that at the moment of death we become
conscious that it is a mere illusion that has limited our existence
to our person. Indeed empirical traces of this may be found in
several states which are related to death by the abolition of the
concentration of consciousness in the brain, among which the
magnetic sleep is the most prominent; for in it, if it reaches a high
degree, our existence shows itself through various symptoms,
beyond our persons and in other beings, most strikingly by direct[419]
participation in the thoughts of another individual, and ultimately
even by the power of knowing the absent, the distant, and even
the future, thus by a kind of omnipresence.

Upon this metaphysical identity of the will, as the thing in
itself, in the infinite multiplicity of its phenomena, three principal
phenomena depend, which may be included under the common
name of sympathies: 

1. sympathy proper, which, as I have shown, is the basis of justice and benevolence, caritas; (2) sexual
love, with capricious selection, amor, which is the life of the
species, that asserts its precedence over that of the individual; (3)
magic, to which animal magnetism and sympathetic cures also
belong. Accordingly sympathy may be defined as the empirical
appearance of the metaphysical identity of the will, through the
physical multiplicity of its phenomena, whereby a connection
shows itself which is entirely different from that brought about
by means of the forms of the phenomenon which we comprehend
under the principle of sufficient reason.
