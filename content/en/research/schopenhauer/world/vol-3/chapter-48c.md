Book 2 put:
- the origin of knowledge in the will
- the sole function of knowledge is to be serviceable to the ends of the will

True salvation lies in the denial of the will.

All religions at their highest point pass over into mysticism and mysteries, i.e., into darkness and veiled obscurity where  knowledge ceases.

Therefore, for thought this can only be expressed by negations.

But for sense perception, it is indicated by symbolical signs.

In temples by dim light and silence; in Brahmanism by the required suspension of all thought and perception for the sake of sinking oneself profoundly in the grounds of one's own being, mentally pronouncing the mysterious Oum.

<!-- 48 If we keep in view the essential immanence of our knowledge and of all knowledge, which arises from the fact that it is a secondary thing which has only appeared for the ends of the will, it then becomes explicable to us that all mystics of all religions ultimately attain to a kind of ecstasy, in which all and every knowledge, with its whole fundamental form, object and subject, in the widest sense is every guidance to the immediate consciousness of that to which neither perception nor conception, thus in general no knowledge extends. -->

The mystic is thus opposed to the philosopher by the fact that he begins from within, while the philosopher begins from without. 

The mystic starts from his inner, positive, individual experience, in which he finds himself to be the eternal and only being, &c. 

But nothing of this is communicable except the assertions which one has to accept upon his word; consequently he cannot convince. The philosopher, on the other hand, starts from what is common to
all, from the objective phenomenon which lies before all, and
from the facts of consciousness as they are present in all. 

His method is therefore reflection upon all this, and combination of the data given in it: accordingly he can convince. He ought therefore to beware of falling into the way of the mystics, and, for
example, by the assertion of intellectual intuitions or pretended
immediate apprehensions of the reason, to seek to make a vain
show of positive knowledge of that which is for ever inaccessible
to all knowledge, or at the most can be indicated by means of a
negation.

The value and worth of philosophy lies in the fact that
it rejects all assumptions which cannot be established, and takes
as its data only what can be certainly proved in the world given in
external perception, in the forms of apprehension of this world,
which are constitutive of our intellect, and in the consciousness
entirely ceases, and only in this sphere, which lies beyond all knowledge, do
they claim to have reached their highest goal, for they have then attained to the
sphere in which there is no longer any subject and object, and consequently no
more knowledge, just because there is no more will, the service of which is the
sole destiny of knowledge.

Whoever has comprehended this will no longer regard it as beyond all measure extravagant that Fakirs should sit down, and, contemplating the tip of their nose, seek to banish all thought and perception, and that in many
passages of the Upanischads instructions are given to sink oneself, silently and
inwardly pronouncing the mysterious Oum, in the depths of one's own being,
where subject and object and all knowledge disappear.

of one's own self which is common to all. Therefore it must
remain cosmology, and cannot become theology. Its theme must
limit itself to the world; to express in all aspects what this is,
what it is in its inmost nature, is all that it can honestly achieve.
Now it answers to this that my system when it reaches its highest
point assumes a negative character, thus ends with a negation.
It can here speak only of what is denied, given up: but what is
thereby won, what is laid hold of, it is obliged (at the conclusion
of the fourth book) to denote as nothing, and can only add the
consolation that it is merely a relative, not an absolute nothing.

For if something is none of all the things which we know, it is
certainly for us, speaking generally, nothing. 

But it does not yet
follow from this that it is absolutely nothing, that from every
possible point of view and in every possible sense it must be
nothing, but only that we are limited to a completely negative
knowledge of it, which may very well lie in the limitation of
our point of view. Now it is just here that the mystic proceeds
positively, and therefore it is just from this point that nothing but
mysticism remains. However, any one who wishes this kind of
supplement to the negative knowledge to which alone philoso-
phy can guide him will find it in its most beautiful and richest
form in the Oupnekhat, then also in the Enneads of Plotinus,[432]
in Scotus Erigena, in passages of Jakob Böhm, but especially
in the marvellous work of Madame de Guion, Les Torrens, and
in Angelus Silesius; finally also in the poems of the Sufis, of
which Tholuk has given us a collection translated into Latin,
and another translated into German, and in many other works.
The Sufis are the Gnostics of Islam. Hence Sadi denotes them
by a word which may be translated “full of insight.” Theism,
calculated with reference to the capacity of the multitude, places
the source of existence without us, as an object. 

All mysticism,
and so also Sufism, according to the various degrees of its initiation, draws it gradually back within us, as the subject, and
the adept recognises at last with wonder and delight that he is it himself. This procedure, common to all mysticism, we find
not only expressed by Meister Eckhard, the father of German
mysticism, in the form of a precept for the perfect ascetic, “that
he seek not God outside himself” (Eckhard's works, edited by
Pfeiffer, vol. i. p. 626), but also very naïvely exhibited by
Eckhard's spiritual daughter, who sought him out, when she had
experienced that conversion in herself, to cry out joyfully to him,
“Sir, rejoice with me, I have become God” (loc. cit., p. 465). The
mysticism of the Sufis also expresses itself throughout precisely
in accordance with this spirit, principally as a revelling in the
consciousness that one is oneself the kernel of the world and the
source of all existence, to which all returns. Certainly there also
often appears the call to surrender all volition as the only way
in which deliverance from individual existence and its suffering
is possible, yet subordinated and required as something easy. In
the mysticism of the Hindus, on the other hand, the latter side
comes out much more strongly, and in Christian mysticism it
is quite predominant, so that pantheistic consciousness, which
is essential to all mysticism, here only appears in a secondary
manner, in consequence of the surrender of all volition, as union
with God. Corresponding to this difference of the conception, [433]
Mohammedan mysticism has a very serene character, Christian
mysticism a gloomy and melancholy character, while that of the
Hindus, standing above both, in this respect also holds the mean.
Quietism, i.e., surrender of all volition, asceticism, i.e., in-
tentional mortification of one's own will, and mysticism, i.e.,
consciousness of the identity of one's own nature with that of
all things or with the kernel of the world, stand in the closest
connection; so that whoever professes one of them is gradually
led to accept the others, even against his intention. Nothing can
be more surprising than the agreement with each other of the
writers who present these doctrines, notwithstanding the greatest
difference of their age, country, and religion, accompanied by the
firm certainty and inward confidence with which they set forth the permanence of their inner experience. They do not constitute a sect, which adheres to, defends, and propagates a favourite
dogma once laid hold of; indeed the Indian, Christian, and Mohammedan mystics, quietists, and ascetics are different in every
respect, except the inner significance and spirit of their teaching.

A very striking example of this is afforded by the comparison of
the Torrens of Madame de Guion with the teaching of the Vedas,
especially with the passage in the Oupnekhat, vol. i. p. 63, which
contains the content of that French work in the briefest form,
but accurately and even with the same images, and yet could not
possibly have been known to Madame de Guion in 1680. In the
“Deutschen Theologie” (the only unmutilated edition, Stuttgart,
1851) it is said in chapters 2 and 3 that both the fall of the devil
and that of Adam consisted in the fact that the one as the other
ascribed to himself the I and me, the mine and to me, and on
p. 89 it is said: “In true love there remains neither I nor me,
mine, to me, thou, thine, and the like.” Now, corresponding to
this, it is said in the “Kural,” from the Tamilian by Graul, p. 8:
“The passion of the mine directed outwardly, and that of the I[434]
directed inwardly, cease” (cf. ver. 346). And in the “Manual
of Buddhism” by Spence Hardy, p. 258, Buddha says: “My disciples reject the thoughts I am this, or this is mine.” In general,
if we look away from the forms which are introduced by external
circumstances and go to the bottom of the matter, we will find
that Sakya Muni and Meister Eckhard teach the same; only that
the former dared to express his thoughts directly, while the latter
is obliged to clothe them in the garments of the Christian myth
and adapt his expressions to this. He carries this, however, so
far that with him the Christian myth has become little more than
a symbolical language, just as the Hellenic myth became for the Neo-Platonists: he takes it throughout allegorically. In the
same respect it is worth noticing that the transition of St. Francis
from prosperity to the mendicant life is similar to the still greater
step of Buddha Sakya Muni from prince to beggar, and that, corresponding to this, the life of St. Francis, and also the order
he founded, was just a kind of Sannyasiism. Indeed it deserves to
be mentioned that his relationship with the Indian spirit appears
also in his great love for the brutes and frequent intercourse with
them, when he always calls them his sisters and brothers; and his
beautiful Cantico also bears witness to his inborn Indian spirit by
the praise of the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the water, the
fire, and the earth.49

Even the Christian quietists must often have had little or no
knowledge of each other; for example, Molinos and Madame de
Guion of Tauler and the “Deutsche Theologie,” or Gichtel of the
former. In any case, the great difference of their culture, in that
some of them, like Molinos, were learned, others, like Gichtel
and many more, were the reverse, has no essential influence upon
their teaching. Their great internal agreement, along with the [435]
firmness and certainty of their utterances, proves all the more
that they speak from real inward experience, from an experience
which certainly is not accessible to all, but is possessed only by
a few favoured individuals, and therefore has received the name
of the work of grace, the reality of which, however, for the above
reasons, is not to be doubted. But in order to understand all
this one must read the mystics themselves, and not be contented
with second-hand reports of them; for every one must himself
be comprehended before one judges concerning him. Thus to
become acquainted with quietism I specially recommend Meister
Eckhard, the “Deutsche Theologie,” Tauler, Madame de Guion,
Antoinette Bourignon, the English Bunyan, Molinos50 and Gichtel.
