In the same way, as practical proofs and examples of the profound seriousness of asceticism, the life of Pascal, edited by Reuchlin, together with his history of the Port-Royal, and also the Histoire de Sainte Elisabeth, par le comte de Montalembert, and La vie de Rancé, par Chateaubriand, are very well worth reading, but yet by no means exhaust all that is important in this class. 

Whoever has read such writings, and compared their spirit with that of ascetism and quietism as it runs through all works of
Brahmanism and Buddhism, and speaks in every page, will admit that every philosophy, which must in consistency reject that
whole mode of thought, which it can only do by explaining the representatives of it to be either impostors or mad-men, must just on this account necessarily be false. But all European systems,
with the exception of mine, find themselves in this position.

Truly it must be an extraordinary madness which, under the most widely different circumstances and persons possible, spoke with such agreement, and, moreover, was raised to the position of a chief doctrine of their religion, by the most ancient and numerous peoples of the earth, something like three-fourths of all the inhabitants of Asia. But no philosophy can leave the theme of quietism and asceticism undecided if the question is proposed to it; because this theme is, in its matter, identical with that of all metaphysics and ethics.

Here then is a point upon which I expect and desire that every philosophy, with its optimism, should declare itself. And if, in the judgment of contemporaries, the paradoxical and unexampled agreement of my philosophy with
quietism and asceticism appears as an open stumbling-block, I, on the contrary, see just in that agreement a proof of its sole
correctness and truth, and also a ground of explanation of why it is ignored and kept secret by the Protestant universities.


For not only the religions of the East, but also true Christianity, has throughout that ascetic fundamental character which my
philosophy explains as the denial of the will to live; although
Protestantism, especially in its present form, seeks to conceal
this. Yet even the open enemies of Christianity who have appeared in the most recent times have ascribed to it the doctrines
of renunciation, self-denial, perfect chastity, and, in general, mortification of the will, which they quite correctly denote by the name of the “anti-cosmic tendency,” and have fully proved that such doctrines are essentially proper to original and genuine Christianity. 

In this they are undeniably right. But that they set up this as an evident and patent reproach to Christianity, while
just here lies its profoundest truth, its high value, and its sublime
character,—this shows an obscuring of the mind, which can only
be explained by the fact that these men's minds, unfortunately
like thousands more at the present day in Germany, are completely spoiled and distorted by the miserable Hegelism, that school
of dulness, that centre of misunderstanding and ignorance, that mind-destroying, spurious wisdom, which now at last begins to
be recognised as such, and the veneration of which will soon be left to the Danish Academy, in whose eyes even that gross
charlatan is a summus philosophus, for whom it takes the field:

“Car ils suivront la créance et estude,
De l'ignorante et sotte multitude,
Dont le plus lourd sera reça pour juge.”
—RABELAIS.

In any case, the ascetic tendency is unmistakable in the gen-
uine and original Christianity as it developed in the writings of
the Church Fathers from its kernel in the New Testament; it is the
summit towards which all strives upwards. As its chief doctrine
we find the recommendation of genuine and pure celibacy (this
first and most important step in the denial of the will to live),
which is already expressed in the New Testament.51 Strauss
also, in his “Life of Jesus” (vol i. p. 618 of the first edition),
says, with reference to the recommendation of celibacy given
51 Matt. xix. 11 seq.; Luke xx. (1 Thess. iv. 3; 1 John iii. 3); Rev. 35-37; 1
Cor. vii. 1-11 and 25-40, xiv. 4.

in Matt. xix. 11 seq., “That the doctrine of Jesus may not
run counter to the ideas of the present day, men have hastened
to introduce surreptitiously the thought that Jesus only praised
celibacy with reference to the circumstances of the time, and in
order to leave the activity of the Apostles unfettered; but there
is even less indication of this in the context than in the kindred
passage, 1 Cor. vii. 25 seq.; but we have here again one of
the places where ascetic principles, such as prevailed among the
Essenes, and probably still more widely among the Jews, appear
in the teaching of Jesus also.” This ascetic tendency appears
more decidedly later than at the beginning, when Christianity,
still seeking adherents, dared not pitch its demands too high;
and by the beginning of the third century it is expressly urged.
Marriage, in genuine Christianity, is merely a compromise with
the sinful nature of man, as a concession, something allowed to
those who lack strength to aspire to the highest, an expedient[438]
to avoid greater evil: in this sense it receives the sanction of the
Church in order that the bond may be indissoluble. But celibacy
and virginity are set up as the higher consecration of Christianity
through which one enters the ranks of the elect. Through these
alone does one attain the victor's crown, which even at the present
day is signified by the wreath upon the coffin of the unmarried,
and also by that which the bride lays aside on the day of her
marriage.

A piece of evidence upon this point, which certainly comes
to us from the primitive times of Christianity, is the pregnant
answer of the Lord, quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus (Strom. iii.
6 et 9) from the Gospel of the Egyptians: “§√ £±ª…º√ A ∫≈¡πø¬
¿≈Ω∏±ΩøºμΩ√, ºμ«¡π ¿øƒμ ∏±Ω±ƒø¬ π√«≈√μπ; ºμ«¡π¬ ±Ω μπ¿μΩ,
Qºμπ¬, ±1 ≥≈Ω±π∫μ¬, ƒπ∫ƒμƒμ” (Salomæ interroganti quousque vi-
gebit mors? Dominus guoadlusque inguit vos, mulieres, paritis).
“§ø≈ƒΩ μ√ƒπ, ºμ«¡π¬ ±Ω ±1 μ¿π∏≈ºπ±π μΩμ¡≥…√π” (Hoc est, quamdiu
operabuntur cupiditates), adds Clement, c. 9, with which he at
once connects the famous passage, Rom. v. 12. Further on, c. 13, he quotes the words of Cassianus: 

(Cum interrogaret Salome, quando cognoscentur ea, de quibus
interrogabat, ait Dominus: quando pudoris indumentum concul-
caveritis, et quando duo facto fuerint unum, et masculum cum
fæmina nec masculum, nec fæminium), i.e., when she no longer
needs the veil of modesty, since all distinction of sex will have
disappeared.

With regard to this point the heretics have certainly gone
furthest: even in the second century the Tatianites or Encratites,
the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Montanists, Valentinians, and
Cassians; yet only because with reckless consistency they gave
honour to the truth, and therefore, in accordance with the spirit
of Christianity, they taught perfect continence; while the Church
prudently declared to be heresy all that ran counter to its far-see- [439]
ing policy. Augustine says of the Tatianites: “Nuptias damnant,
atque omnino pares eas fornicationibus aliisque corruptionibus
faciunt: nec recipiunt in suum numerum conjugio utentem, sive
marem, sive fœminam. Non vescunlur carnibus, easque abomi-
nantur.” (De hœresi ad quod vult Deum. hœr., 25.) But even the
orthodox Fathers look upon marriage in the light indicated above,
and zealously preach entire continence, the .... 

Athanasius gives as the cause of marriage: 

...

(Quia subjacemus condemnationi propatoris nostri;
... nam finis, a Deo prœlatus, erat, nos non per nuptias et
corruptionem fieri: sed transgressio mandati nuptias introduxit,
propter legis violationem Adœ.—Exposit. in psalm. 50). 

<!-- Tertullian calls marriage genus mali inferioris, ex indulgentia ortum
(De pudicitia, c. 16) and says: “Matrimonium et stuprum est commixtio carnis; scilicet cujus concupiscentiam dominus stu-
pro adœquavit. Ergo, inguis, jam et primas, id est unas nuptias
destruis? Nec immerito: quoniam et ipsœ ex eo constant, quod
est stuprum” (De exhort. castit., c. 9). Indeed, Augustine himself
commits himself entirely to this doctrine and all its results, for
he says: “Novi quosdam, qui murmurent: quid, si, inquiunt,
omnes velint ab omni concubitu abstinere, unde subsistet genus
humanum? Utinam omnes hoc vellent! dumtaxat in caritate, de
corde puro et conscientia bona, et fide non ficta: multo citius
Dei civitas compleretur, ut acceleraretur terminus mundi” (De
bono conjugali, c. 10). And again: “Non vos ab hoc studio, quo
multos ad imitandum vos excitatis, frangat querela vanorum,
qui dicunt: quomodo subsistet genus humanum, si omnes fuerint
continentes? Quasi propter aliud retardetur hoc seculum, nisi
ut impleatur prœdestinatus numerus ille sanctorum, quo citius
impleto, profecto nec terminus seculi differetur” (De bono indi-
viduitatis, c. 23).  -->


One sees at once that he identifies salvation with the end of the world. The other passages in the works of
Augustine which bear on this point will be found collected in
the “Confessio Augustiniana e D. Augustini operibus compilata
a Hieronymo Torrense,” 1610, under the headings De matrimo-
nio, De cœlibatu, &c., and any one may convince himself from
these that in ancient, genuine Christianity marriage was only a
concession, which besides this was supposed to have only the
begetting of children as its end, that, on the other hand, perfect
continence was the true virtue far to be preferred to this. To
those, however, who do not wish to go back to the authorities
themselves I recommend two works for the purpose of removing
any kind of doubt as to the tendency of Christianity we are speak-
ing about: Carové, “Ueber das Cölibatgesetz,” 1832, and Lind,
“De cœlibatu Christianorum per tria priora secula,” Havniœ, 1839.
