It is, however, by no means the views of these writers
themselves to which I refer, for these are opposed to mine, but
solely to their carefully collected accounts and quotations, which deserve full acceptance as quite trustworthy, just because both these writers are opponents of celibacy, the former a rationalistic
Catholic, and the other a Protestant candidate in theology, who
speaks exactly like one. In the first-named work we find, vol.
i. p. 166, in that reference, the following result expressed: 

“In accordance with the Church view, as it may be read in canonical Church Fathers, in the Synodal and Papal instructions, and in innumerable writings of orthodox Catholics, perpetual chastity is
called a divine, heavenly, angelic virtue, and the obtaining of the
assistance of divine grace for this end is made dependent upon
earnest prayer. We have already shown that this Augustinian
doctrine is by Canisius and in the decrees of the Council of Trent
expressed as an unchanging belief of the Church. That, however,
it has been retained as a dogma till the present day is sufficiently
established by the June number, 1831, of the magazine ‘Der Katholik.’ 


It is said there, p. 263: ‘In Catholicism the observance of a perpetual chastity, for the sake of God, appears as in
itself the highest merit of man. The view that the observance
of continual chastity as an end in itself sanctifies and exalts the
man is, as every instructed Catholic is convinced, deeply rooted
in Christianity, both as regards its spirit and its express precepts.
The decrees of the Council of Trent have abolished all possible
doubt on this point....’ It must at any rate be confessed by every
unprejudiced person, not only that the doctrine expressed by ‘Der
Katholik’ is really Catholic, but also that the proofs adduced may
be quite irrefutable for a Catholic reason, because they are drawn
so directly from the ecclesiastical view, taken by the Church, of
life and its destiny.” It is further said in the same work, p. 270:
“Although both Paul calls the forbidding to marry a false doctrine, and the still Judaistic author of the Epistle to the Hebrews enjoins that marriage shall be held in honour by all, and the bed
kept undefiled (Heb. xiii 4), yet the main tendency of these two
sacred writers is not on that account to be mistaken. Virginity
is for both the perfect state, marriage only a make-shift for the weak, and only as such to be held inviolable. The highest effort, on the other hand, was directed to complete, material putting off
of self. 

The self must turn and refrain from all that tends only
to its own pleasure, and that only temporarily.” Lastly, p. 288:
“We agree with the Abbé Zaccaria, who asserts that celibacy (not
the law of celibacy) is before everything to be deduced from the
teaching of Christ and the Apostle Paul.”

What is opposed to this specially Christian view is everywhere
and always merely the Old Testament, with its ¿±Ωƒ± ∫±ª± ªπ±Ω.
This appears with peculiar distinctness from that important third
book of the Stromata of Clement, where, arguing against the en-
cratistic heretics mentioned above, he constantly opposes to them
only Judaism, with its optimistic history of creation, with which
the world-denying tendency of the New Testament is certainly[442]
in contradiction. But the connection of the New Testament with
the Old is at bottom only external, accidental, and forced; and
the one point at which Christian doctrine can link itself on to the
latter is only to be found, as has been said, in the story of the fall,
which, moreover, stands quite isolated in the Old Testament, and
is made no further use of. But, in accordance with the account in
the Gospels, it is just the orthodox adherents of the Old Testament
who bring about the crucifixion of the founder of Christianity,
because they find his teaching in conflict with their own. In
the said third book of the Stromata of Clement the antagonism
between optimism with theism on the one hand, and pessimism
with ascetic morality on the other, comes out with surprising
distinctness. This book is directed against the Gnostics, who just
taught pessimism and asceticism, that is, μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ± (abstinence
of every kind, but especially from all sexual satisfaction); on
account of which Clement censures them vigorously. 

But, at the same time, it becomes apparent that even the spirit of the
Old Testament stands in this antagonism with that of the New
Testament. For, apart from the fall, which appears in the Old
Testament like a hors d'œuvre, the spirit of the Old Testament is diametrically opposed to that of the New Testament—the former optimistic, the latter pessimistic. Clement himself brings this
contradiction out prominently at the end of the eleventh chapter
(¿¡ø√±¿øƒμπΩøºμΩøΩ ƒøΩ †±≈ªøΩ ƒÛ ö¡π√ƒ√ ∫.ƒ.ª.), although he will not allow that it is a real contradiction, but explains it as only apparent,—like a good Jew, as he is. In general it is interesting
to see how with Clement the New and the Old Testament get mixed up together; and he strives to reconcile them, yet for the
most part drives out the New Testament with the Old. Just at
the beginning of the third chapter he objects to the Marcionites
that they find fault with the creation, after the example of Plato
and Pythagoras; for Marcion teaches that nature is bad, made out of bad materials (∆≈√π¬ ∫±∫∑, μ∫ ƒμ Qª∑¬ ∫±∫∑¬); therefore
one ought not to people this world, but to abstain from marriage.

Now Clement, to whom in general the Old Testament is much
more congenial and convincing than the New, takes this very
much amiss. He sees in it their flagrant ingratitude to and enmity
and rebellion against him who has made the world, the just
demiurgus, whose work they themselves are, and yet despise the
use of his creatures, in impious rebellion “forsaking the natural
opinion” (±Ωƒπƒ±√√øºμΩøπ ƒÛ ¿øπ∑ƒ√ ƒÛ √∆…Ω, ... μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ¬ ƒ√
¿¡ø¬ ƒøΩ ¿μ¿øπ∑∫øƒ± μ«∏¡≥, º∑ ≤ø≈ªøºμΩøπ «¡∑√∏±π ƒøπ¬ Q¿Ω

ªø≥π√º…π). At the same time, in his holy zeal, he will not allow
the Marcionites even the honour of originality, but, armed with
his well-known erudition, he brings it against them, and supports
his case with the most beautiful quotations, that even the ancient
philosophers, that Heraclitus and Empedocles, Pythagoras and
Plato, Orpheus and Pindar, Herodotus and Euripides, and also
the Sibyls, lamented deeply the wretched nature of the world,
thus taught pessimism. Now in this learned enthusiasm he does
not observe that in this way he is just giving the Marcionites
water for their mill, for he shows that

“All the wisest of all the ages”
have taught and sung what they do, but confidently and boldly
he quotes the most decided and energetic utterances of the an-
cients in this sense. Certainly they cannot lead him astray. Wise
men may mourn the sadness of existence, poets may pour out
the most affecting lamentations about it, nature and experience
may cry out as loudly as they will against optimism,—all this
does not touch our Church Father: he holds his Jewish revelation
in his hand, and remains confident. The demiurgus made the
world. From this it is a priori certain that it is excellent, and it[444]
may look as it likes. The same thing then takes place with regard
to the second point, the μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±, through which, according
to his view, the Marcionites show their ingratitude towards the
demiurgus.

Here now the tragic poets have preceded the Encratites (to the preju-
dice of their originality) and have said the same things. For since
they also lament the infinite misery of existence, they have added
that it is better to bring no children into such a world; which
he now again supports with the most beautiful passages, and, at
the same time, accuses the Pythagoreans of having renounced
sexual pleasure on this ground. But all this touches him not; he
sticks to his principle that all these sin against the demiurgus, in
that they teach that one ought not to marry, ought not to beget
children, ought not to bring new miserable beings into the world,
ought not to provide new food for death (¥0 μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±¬ ±√μ≤ø≈√π

ƒμ¡ø≈¬, º∑¥μ μ¿π«ø¡∑≥μπΩ ∏±Ω±ƒÛ ƒ¡ø∆∑Ω—c. 6). Since the
learned Church Father thus denounces μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±, he seems to
have had no presentiment that just after his time the celibacy of the Christian priesthood would be more and more introduced, and
finally, in the eleventh century, raised to the position of a law,
because it is in keeping with the spirit of the New Testament. It is
just this spirit which the Gnostics have grasped more profoundly
and understood better than our Church Father, who is more Jew
than Christian. The conception of the Gnostics comes out very
clearly at the beginning of the ninth chapter, where the following
passage is quoted from the Gospel of the Egyptians: ë≈ƒø¬ μπ¿μΩ
A £…ƒ∑¡, “∑ª∏øΩ ∫±ƒ±ª≈√±π ƒ± μ¡≥± ƒ∑¬ ∏∑ªμπ±¬;” ∏∑ªμπ±¬

dixisse Servatorem: veni ad dissolvendum opera feminæ; feminæ
quidem, cupiditatis; opera autem, generationem et interitum);
but quite specially at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning
of the fourteenth chapter. The Church certainly was obliged to
consider how to set a religion upon its legs that could also walk
and stand in the world as it is, and among men; therefore it
declared these persons to be heretics. At the conclusion of the
seventh chapter our Church Father opposes Indian asceticism, as
bad, to Christian Judaism; whereby the fundamental difference
of the spirit of the two religions is clearly brought out. In Judaism
and Christianity everything runs back to obedience or disobedi-
ence to the command of God: Q¿±∫ø∑ ∫±π ¿±¡±∫ø∑; as befits us
creatures, !ºπΩ, ƒøπ¬ ¿μ¿ª±√ºμΩøπ¬ Q¿ø ƒ∑¬ ƒø≈ †±Ωƒø∫¡±ƒø¡ø¬
≤ø≈ª∑√μ…¬ (nobis, qui Omnipotentis voluntate efficti sumus),
chap. 14. Then comes, as a second duty, ª±ƒ¡μ≈μπΩ ∏μÛ ∂…Ωƒπ,
to serve God, extol His works, and overflow with thankfulness.
Certainly the matter has a very different aspect in Brahmanism
and Buddhism, for in the latter all improvement and conversion,
and the only deliverance we can hope for from this world of
suffering, this Sansara, proceeds from the knowledge of the four
fundamental truths: (1) dolor; (2) doloris ortus; (3) doloris inte-
ritus; (4) octopartita via ad doloris sedationem (Dammapadam,
ed. Fausböll, p. 35 et 347). The explanation of these four truths
will be found in Bournouf, “Introduct. à l'hist. du Buddhisme,”
434 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
p. 629, and in all expositions of Buddhism.
