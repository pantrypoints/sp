The church-dance, also, which follows the sermon is accompanied by the singing of the rest. It is a lively dance, performed in
measured time, and concludes with a galop, which is carried on till the dancers are exhausted. Between each dance one of their
teachers cries aloud, “Think, that ye rejoice before the Lord for
having slain your flesh; for this is here the only use we make of
our refractory limbs.” To celibacy most of the other conditions
link themselves on of themselves. There are no families, and
therefore there is no private property, but community of goods.

All are clothed alike, in Quaker fashion, and with great neatness.


They are industrious and diligent: idleness is not endured. They
have also the enviable rule that they are to avoid all unnecessary
noise, such as shouting, door-slamming, whip-cracking, loud
knocking, &c. Their rule of life has been thus expressed by
one of them: “Lead a life of innocence and purity, love your
neighbours as yourself, live at peace with all men, and refrain
from war, blood-shed, and all violence against others, as well as
from all striving after worldly honour and distinction. Give to
each his own, and follow after holiness, without which no man
can see the Lord. Do good to all so far as your opportunity and
your power extends.” 

They persuade no one to join them, but test those who present themselves by a novitiate of several years.

Moreover, every one is free to leave them; very rarely is any one
expelled for misconduct. Adopted children are carefully educat-
ed, and only when they are grown up do they voluntarily join the
sect. It is said that in the controversies of their ministers with
Anglican clergy the latter generally come off the worse, for the
arguments consist of passages from the New Testament. Fuller
accounts of them will be found particularly in Maxwell's “Run
through the United States,” 1841; also in Benedict's “History of
all Religions,” 1830; also in the Times, November 4, 1837, and in
the German magazine Columbus, May number, 1831. 

A German sect in America, very similar to them, who also live in strict celibacy and continence, are the Rappists. An account of them is given in F. Loher's “Geschichte und Zustande der Deutschen in Amerika,” 1853. In Russia also the Raskolniks are a similar sect. 


The Gichtelians live also in strict chastity. But among the ancient
Jews we already find a prototype of all these sects, the Essenes,
of whom even Pliny gives an account (Hist. Nat., v. 15), and who
resembled the Shakers very much, not only in celibacy, but also
in other respects; for example, in dancing during divine service,
which leads to the opinion that the founder of the Shakers took
the Essenes as a pattern. In the presence of such facts as these
how does Luther's assertion look: “Ubi natura, quemadmodum a
Deo nobis insita est, fertur ac rapitur, FIERI NULLO MODO POTEST,
ut extra matrimonium caste vivatur”? (Catech. maj.)

Although Christianity, in essential respects, taught only what
all Asia knew long before, and even better, yet for Europe it
was a new and great revelation, in consequence of which the
spiritual tendency of the European nations was therefore entirely
transformed. For it disclosed to them the metaphysical signifi-
cance of existence, and therefore taught them to look away from
the narrow, paltry, ephemeral life of earth, and to regard it no
longer as an end in itself, but as a condition of suffering, guilt,
trial, conflict, and purification, out of which, by means of moral
achievements, difficult renunciation, and denial of oneself, one
may rise to a better existence, which is inconceivable by us. 

It taught the great truth of the assertion and denial of the will to live in the clothing of allegory by saying that through Adam's fall the curse has come upon all, sin has come into the world, and
guilt is inherited by all; but that, on the other hand, through the
sacrificial death of Jesus all are reconciled, the world saved, guilt
abolished, and justice satisfied. 

In order, however, to understand the truth itself that is contained in this myth one must not regard
men simply in time, as beings independent of each other, but
must comprehend the (Platonic) Idea of man, which is related
to the series of men, as eternity in itself is related to eternity drawn out as time; hence the eternal Idea man extended in time to the series of men through the connecting bond of generation
appears again in time as a whole. 

If now we keep the Idea of man in view, we see that Adam's fall represents the finite,
animal, sinful nature of man, in respect of which he is a finite
being, exposed to sin, suffering, and death. On the other hand,
the life, teaching, and death of Jesus Christ represent the eternal,
supernatural side, the freedom, the salvation of man. 

Now every man, as such and potentiâ, is both Adam and Jesus, according
as he comprehends himself, and his will thereupon determines
him; in consequence of which he is then condemned and given
over to death, or saved and attains to eternal life. 

These truths, both in their allegorical and in their real acceptation, were
completely new as far as Greeks and Romans were concerned,
who were still entirely absorbed in life, and did not seriously
look beyond it. 

Let whoever doubts this see how Cicero (Pro
Cluentio, c. 61) and Sallust (Catil., c. 47) speak of the state after
death. The ancients, although far advanced in almost everything
else, remained children with regard to the chief concern, and
were surpassed in this even by the Druids, who at least taught
metempsychosis. That one or two philosophers, like Pythagoras
and Plato, thought otherwise alters nothing as regards the whole.
That great fundamental truth, then, which is contained in
Christianity, as in Brahmanism and Buddhism, the need of deliverance from an existence which is given up to suffering and
death, and the attainableness of this by the denial of the will,
thus by a decided opposition to nature, is beyond all comparison
the most important truth there can be; but, at the same time, it is
entirely opposed to the natural tendency of the human race, and
in its true grounds it is difficult to comprehend; as indeed all that
can only be thought generally and in the abstract is inaccessible
to the great majority of men. Therefore for these men there was everywhere required, in order to bring that great truth within the sphere of its practical application, a mythical vehicle for it, as it were a receptacle, without which it would be lost and dissipated.

The truth had therefore everywhere to borrow the garb of the
fable, and also constantly to endeavour to connect itself with
what in each case was historically given, already familiar, and
already revered. What sensu proprio remained inaccessible to
the great mass of mankind of all ages and lands, with their low
tone of mind, their intellectual stupidity and general brutality,
had, for practical purposes, to be brought home to them sensu
allegorico, in order to become their guiding star. So, then,
the religions mentioned above are to be regarded as the sacred
vessels in which the great truth, known and expressed for several
thousand years, indeed perhaps since the beginning of the human
race, which yet in itself, for the great mass of mankind always
remains a mystery, is, according to the measure of their powers,
made accessible to them, preserved and transmitted through the
centuries. Yet, because all that does not through and through
consist of the imperishable material of pure truth is subject to
destruction, whenever this fate befalls such a vessel, through
contact with a heterogeneous age, its sacred content must in
some way be saved and preserved for mankind by another. 

But it is the task of philosophy, since it is one with pure truth, to present that content pure and unmixed, thus merely in abstract conceptions, and consequently without that vehicle, for those
who are capable of thinking, who are always an exceedingly
small number. 

It is therefore related to religions as a straight line
to several curves running near it: for it expresses sensu proprio,
thus reaches directly, what they show in veiled forms and reach
by circuitous routes.

If now, in order to illustrate what has just been said by an
example, and also to follow a philosophical fashion of my time, I
should wish perhaps to attempt to solve the profoundest mystery
of Christianity, that of the Trinity, in the fundamental conception [454]
of my philosophy, this could be done, with the licence permitted
in such interpretations, in the following manner. 

The Holy Ghost is the distinct denial of the will to live: the man in whom this exhibits itself in concreto is the Son; He is identical with the will which asserts life, and thereby produces the phenomenon of this perceptible world, i.e., with the Father, because the assertion and denial are opposite acts of the same will whose capability for
both is the only true freedom. However, this is to be regarded as
a mere lusus ingenii.

Before I close this chapter I wish to adduce a few proofs in
support of what in § 68 of the first volume I denoted by the
expression îμ≈ƒ≈¡ø¬ ¿ªø≈¬, the bringing about of the denial of
the will by one's own deeply felt suffering, thus not merely by
the appropriation of the suffering of others, and the knowledge
of the vanity and wretchedness of our existence introduced by
this.
