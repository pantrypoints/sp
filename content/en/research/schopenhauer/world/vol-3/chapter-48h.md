We can arrive at a comprehension of what goes on in the heart of a man, in the case of an elevation of this kind and
the accompanying purifying process, by considering what every
emotional man experiences on beholding a tragedy, which is
of kindred nature to this. 

In the third and fourth acts perhaps such a man is distressed and disturbed by the ever more clouded
and threatened happiness of the hero; but when, in the fifth act,
this happiness is entirely wrecked and shattered, he experiences
a certain elevation of the soul, which affords him an infinitely
higher kind of pleasure than the sight of the happiness of the
hero, however great it might be, could ever have given. Now
this is the same thing, in the weak water-colours of sympathy
which is able to raise a well-known illusion, as that which takes
place with the energy of reality in the feeling of our own fate
when it is heavy misfortune that drives the man at last into the
haven of entire resignation. Upon this occurrence depend all
those conversions which completely transform men such as are[455]
described in the text. I may give here in a few words the story
of the conversion of the Abbé Rancé, as it is strikingly similar to
that of Raymond Lully, which is told in the text, and besides this
is memorable on account of its result. 

His youth was devoted to enjoyment and pleasure; finally, he lived in a relation of passion
with a Madame de Montbazon. One evening, when he visited
her, he found her room empty, in disorder and darkness. He
struck something with his foot; it was her head, which had been
severed from the trunk, because after her sudden death her corpse
could not otherwise be got into the lead coffin that stood beside
it. After overcoming an immense sorrow, Rancé now became,
in 1663, the reformer of the order of the Trappists, which at that
time had entirely relaxed the strictness of its rules. He joined this
order, and through him it was led back to that terrible degree of
renunciation which is still maintained at the present day at La
Trappe, and, as the methodically carried out denial of the will,
aided by the severest renunciation and an incredibly hard and
painful manner of life, fills the visitor with sacred awe, after he
has been touched at his reception by the humility of these genuine
monks, who, emaciated by fasting, by cold, by night watches,
prayers and penances, kneel before him, the worldling and the
sinner, to implore his blessing. Of all orders of monks, this one
alone has maintained itself in perfection in France, through all
changes; which is to be attributed to the profound earnestness
which in it is unmistakable, and excludes all secondary ends. It
has remained untouched even by the decline of religion, because
its root lies deeper in human nature than any positive system of
belief.

This great and rapid change of the inmost being of man which we are here considering, and
which has hitherto been entirely neglected by philosophers, ap-
pears most frequently when, with full consciousness, he stands
in the presence of a violent and certain death, thus in the case [456]
of executions. But, in order to bring this process much more
distinctly before our eyes, I regard it as by no means unbecoming
to the dignity of philosophy to quote what has been said by some
criminals before their execution, even at the risk of incurring
the sneer that I encourage gallows' sermons. I certainly rather believe that the gallows is a place of quite peculiar revelations, and a watch-tower from which the man who even then retains
his presence of mind obtains a wider, clearer outlook into eter-
nity than most philosophers over the paragraphs of their rational
psychology and theology. The following speech on the gallows
was made on the 15th April, 1837, at Gloucester, by a man called
Bartlett, who had murdered his mother-in-law: “Englishmen and
fellow countrymen,—I have a few words to say to you, and they
shall be but very few. Yet let me entreat you, one and all, that
these few words that I shall utter may strike deep into your hearts.
Bear them in your mind, not only now while you are witnessing
this sad scene, but take them to your homes, take them, and
repeat them to your children and friends. I implore you as a
dying man—one for whom the instrument of death is even now
prepared—and these words are that you may loose yourselves
from the love of this dying world and its vain pleasures. Think
less of it and more of your God. Do this: repent, repent, for be
assured that without deep and true repentance, without turning
to your heavenly Father, you will never attain, nor can hold the
slightest hope of ever reaching those bowers of bliss to which I
trust I am now fast advancing” (Times, 18th April 1837).
Still more remarkable are the last words of the well-known
murderer, Greenacre, who was executed in London on the 1st of
May 1837. The English newspaper the Post gives the follow-
ing account, which is also reprinted in Galignani's Messenger
of the 6th of May 1837: “On the morning of his execution a
gentleman advised him to put his trust in God, and pray for
forgiveness through the mediation of Jesus Christ. Greenacre[457]
replied that forgiveness through the mediation of Christ was a
matter of opinion; for his part, he believed that in the sight of
the highest Being, a Mohammedan was as good as a Christian
and had just as much claim to salvation. Since his imprisonment
he had had his attention directed to theological subjects, and he
had become convinced that the gallows is a passport to heaven.”

The indifference displayed here towards positive religions is just
what gives this utterance greater weight, for it shows that it
is no fanatical delusion, but individual immediate knowledge
that lies at its foundation. The following incident may also
be mentioned which is given by Galignani's Messenger of the
15th August 1837, from the Limerick Chronicle: “Last Monday
Maria Cooney was executed for the revolting murder of Mrs.
Anderson. So deeply was this wretched woman impressed with
the greatness of her crime that she kissed the rope which was put
round her neck, while she humbly implored the mercy of God.”
Lastly this: the Times, of the 29th April 1845 gives several letters
which Hocker, who was condemned for the murder of Delarue,
wrote the day before his execution. In one of these he says: “I am
persuaded that unless the natural heart be broken, and renewed
by divine mercy, however noble and amiable it may be deemed
by the world, it can never think of eternity without inwardly
shuddering.” These are the outlooks into eternity referred to
above which are obtained from that watch-tower; and I have
had the less hesitation in giving them here since Shakspeare also
says—

“Out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learned.”
—As You Like it, last scene.

Strauss, in his “Life of Jesus,” has proved that Christianity
also ascribes to suffering as such the purifying and sanctifying
power here set forth (Leben Jesu, vol. i. ch. 6, §§ 72 and 74).
He says that the beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount have a
different sense in Luke (vi. 21) from that which they have in [458]
Matt. (v. 3), for only the latter adds ƒÛ ¿Ωμ≈º±ƒπ to º±∫±¡πøπ
ø1 ¿ƒ…«øπ, and ƒ∑Ω ¥π∫±πø√≈Ω∑Ω to ¿μπΩ…Ωƒμ¬. Thus by him
alone are the simple-minded, the humble, &c., meant, while by
Luke are meant the literally poor; so that here the contrast is
446 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
that between present suffering and future happiness. With the
Ebionites it is a capital principle that whoever takes his portion in
this age gets nothing in the future, and conversely. Accordingly
in Luke the blessings are followed by as many ø≈±π, woes, which
are addressed to the rich, ø1 ¿ªø≈√πøπ, the full, ø1 μº¿μ¿ª∑√ºμΩøπ,
and to them that laugh, ø1 ≥μª…Ωƒμ¬, in the Ebionite spirit. In the
same spirit, he says, p. 604, is the parable (Luke xvi. 19) of the
rich man and Lazarus given, which nowhere mentions any fault
of the former or any merit of the latter, and takes as the standard
of the future recompense, not the good done or the wickedness
practised, but the evil suffered here and the good things enjoyed,
in the Ebionite spirit. “A like estimation of outward poverty,”
Strauss goes on, “is also attributed to Jesus by the other synoptists
(Matt. xix. 16; Mark x. 17; Luke xviii. 18), in the story of the
rich young man and the saying about the camel and the eye of a
needle.”
If we go to the bottom of the matter we will recognise that
even in the most famous passages of the Sermon on the Mount
there is contained an indirect injunction to voluntary poverty, and
thereby to the denial of the will to live. For the precept (Matt. v.
40 seq.) to consent unconditionally to all demands made upon
us, to give our cloak also to him who will take away our coat,
&c., similarly (Matt. vi. 25-34) the precept to cast aside all care
for the future, even for the morrow, and so to live simply in the
present, are rules of life the observance of which inevitably leads
to absolute poverty, and which therefore just say in an indirect
manner what Buddha directly commands his disciples and has
confirmed by his own example: throw everything away and
become bhikkhu, i.e., beggars. This appears still more decidedly[459]
in the passage Matt. x. 9-15, where all possessions, even shoes
and a staff, are forbidden to the Apostles, and they are directed to
beg. These commands afterwards became the foundation of the
mendicant order of St. Francis (Bonaventuræ vita S. Francisci,
c. 3). Hence, then, I say that the spirit of Christian ethics is
447
identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism. In conformity
with the whole view expounded here Meister Eckhard also says
(Works, vol. i. p. 492): “The swiftest animal that bears thee to
perfection is suffering.”

Chapter XLIX. The Way Of Salvation.
There is only one inborn error, and that is, that we exist in order
to be happy. It is inborn in us because it is one with our existence
itself, and our whole being is only a paraphrase of it, nay, our
body is its monogram. We are nothing more than will to live and
the successive satisfaction of all our volitions is what we think
in the conception of happiness.
As long as we persist in this inborn error, indeed even become
rigidly fixed in it through optimistic dogmas, the world appears
to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things as in
small, we must experience that the world and life are by no means
arranged with a view to containing a happy existence. While
now by this the thoughtless man only finds himself tormented
in reality, in the case of him who thinks there is added to his
real pain the theoretical perplexity why a world and a life which
exist in order that one may be happy in them answer their end so
badly. First of all it finds expression in pious ejaculations, such
as, “Ah! why are the tears on earth so many?” &c. &c. But
in their train come disquieting doubts about the assumptions of
those preconceived optimistic dogmas. One may try if one will
to throw the blame of one's individual unhappiness now upon the
circumstances, now upon other men, now upon one's own bad
luck, or even upon one's own awkwardness, and may know well
how all these have worked together to produce it; but this in no
way alters the result that one has missed the real end of life,[461]
which consists indeed in being happy. The consideration of this
is, then, often very depressing, especially if life is already on the
wane; hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear
the expression of that which in English is called disappointment.
Besides this, however, hitherto every day of our life has taught
us that joys and pleasures, even if attained, are in themselves
delusive, do not perform what they promise, do not satisfy the
heart, and finally their possession is at least embittered by the disagreeables that accompany them or spring from them; while,
on the contrary, the pains and sorrows prove themselves very
real, and often exceed all expectation. Thus certainly everything
in life is calculated to recall us from that original error, and to
convince us that the end of our existence is not to be happy.
Indeed, if we regard it more closely and without prejudice, life
rather presents itself as specially intended to be such that we shall
not feel ourselves happy in it, for through its whole nature it bears
the character of something for which we have no taste, which
must be endured by us, and from which we have to return as
from an error that our heart may be cured of the passionate desire
of enjoyment, nay, of life, and turned away from the world. In
this sense, it would be more correct to place the end of life in our
woe than in our welfare. For the considerations at the conclusion
of the preceding chapter have shown that the more one suffers
the sooner one attains to the true end of life, and that the more
happily one lives the longer this is delayed. The conclusion of the
last letter of Seneca corresponds with this: bonum tunc habebis
tuum, quum intelliges infelicissimos esse felices; which certainly
seems to show the influence of Christianity. The peculiar effect
of the tragic drama also ultimately depends upon the fact that
it shakes that inborn error by vividly presenting in a great and
striking example the vanity of human effort and the nothingness
of this whole existence, and thus discloses the profound signif- [462]
icance of life; hence it is recognised as the sublimest form of
poetry. Whoever now has returned by one or other path from
that error which dwells in us a priori, that ¿¡…ƒø≈ »μ≈¥ø¬ of
our existence, will soon see all in another light, and will now
find the world in harmony with his insight, although not with his
wishes. Misfortunes of every kind and magnitude, although they
pain him, will no longer surprise him, for he has come to see that
it is just pain and trouble that tend towards the true end of life,
the turning away of the will from it. 

This will give him indeed a
wonderful composedness in all that may happen, similar to that with which a sick person who undergoes a long and painful cure
bears the pain of it as a sign of its efficacy. In the whole of
human existence suffering expresses itself clearly enough as its
true destiny. Life is deeply sunk in suffering, and cannot escape
from it; our entrance into it takes place amid tears, its course is
at bottom always tragic, and its end still more so. There is an
unmistakable appearance of intention in this. As a rule man's
destiny passes through his mind in a striking manner, at the very
summit of his desires and efforts, and thus his life receives a
tragic tendency by virtue of which it is fitted to free him from
the passionate desire of which every individual existence is an
example, and bring him into such a condition that he parts with
life without retaining a single desire for it and its pleasures.
Suffering is, in fact, the purifying process through which alone,
in most cases, the man is sanctified, i.e., is led back from the
path of error of the will to live. In accordance with this, the
salutary nature of the cross and of suffering is so often explained
in Christian books of edification, and in general the cross, an
instrument of suffering, not of doing, is very suitably the symbol
of the Christian religion. Nay, even the Preacher, who is still
Jewish, but so very philosophical, rightly says: “Sorrow is better
than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is
made better” (Eccles. vii. 3). Under the name of the ¥μΩƒ¡ø¬[463]
¿ªø≈¬ I have presented suffering as to a certain extent a substitute
for virtue and holiness; but here I must make the bold assertion
that, taking everything into consideration, we have more to hope
for our salvation and deliverance from what we suffer than from
what we do. Precisely in this spirit Lamartine very beautifully
says in his “Hymne à la douleur,” apostrophising pain:—

“Tu me traites sans doute en favori des cieux,
Car tu n'épargnes pas les larmes à mes yeux.
Eh bien! je les reçois comme tu les envoies,
Tes maux seront mes biens, et tes soupirs mes joies.
Je sens qu'il est en toi, sans avoir combattu,
