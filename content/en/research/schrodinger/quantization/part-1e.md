§ 2. Condition (15) gives

<!-- −El = me4

Therefore, the well-known Bohr energy levels, which correspond to the Balmer
terms, arise when one assign to the constant K, which we had to introduce in (2)
for dimensional reasons, the value

(20) K = h
2π .

18Translator’s note: Note that in the nowadays textbooks one usually sees n ↔ l, i.e. l is
the order of the spherical harmonic and n denotes the energy levels.

Then one has of course
(19′) −El = 2π2me4
h2l2 .

Our l is the principal quantum number. n+1 has analogy with the azimuthal quan-
tum number, the further division of this number in the definition of the spherical
harmonics can be put into analogy with the division of the azimuthal quantum
in a “equatorial” quantum and in a “polar” quantum. These numbers determine
here the system of nodal lines on the sphere. Also the “radial quantum number,”
l − n − 1 determines exactly the number of “nodal spheres”, since one can easily
convince themselves that the function f (x) in (18) has exactly l−n−1 real positive
roots. — The positive values of E correspond to the continuum of the hyperbolic
trajectories, to which one can attribute, in a certain sense, the radial quantum
number ∞. To this corresponds, as we have seen, that the related solutions go to
infinity with steady oscillations.

It also of interest that the region inside which the functions (18) are considerably
different from zero and inside which they display their oscillations is anyway of the
general order of magnitude of the great axis of the assigned ellipse. The factor,
multiplied with which the radius vector appears as argument of the constant-free
function f , is — obviously — the reciprocal of a length, and this length is

(21) K
√−2mE = K2l
me2 = h2l
4π2me2 = al
l ,

where al is the semi-major axis of the l-th elliptical trajectory. (The equations
follow from (19) together with the known relation El = − e2

2a2
l
).

The quantity (21) gives the order of magnitude of the region of the roots for
small l and n; then it can be deduced that the roots of f (x) are of order of
magnitude one. This is naturally not the case if the coefficients of the polynomial
are large numbers. I would like not to address now the more precise estimate of
the roots, but I believe that through that the above claim will prove itself quite
correct.

§ 3. It is natural to relate the function ψ to a vibration process occurring
in the atom, which is more realistic than the today very often doubted electron
trajectories. Originally, I also had the aim of motivating the new interpretation of
the quantum prescription in this more expressive way, but then I have preferred the
above neutral mathematical form because it allows to bring more clearly to light
the essential. As the essential it seems to me that it does not come out anymore
the secret “requirement of integerness”, but this is, so to say, traced one step back:
it has its basis in the finiteness and single-valuedness of a certain function of space.
I would also like now not yet to go closer this discussion of the possibilities
interpretations of this vibration process, before some somehow more complicated
cases are worked out with success in the new interpretation. It is not settled that
the latter in its results will be a mere reproduction of the usual quantum theory.
For example, the relativistic Kepler problem, if one goes through the calculation
exactly according to the prescription given at the beginning, leads strangely to
half-integer quantum numbers (radial and azimuthal quanta).

Nevertheless, let some more remarks about the idea of the vibration be allowed
here. First of all, I would like not to leave unmentioned, that I owe the stimula-
tion to these reflections in the first place to the brilliant thesis of Mr. Louis de
Broglie20) and to the thought about the spatial distribution of those “phasewave”,
for which he has shown that always an integer number of them, measured along
the trajectory, are allotted to each period or quasiperiod of the electron. The main
difference is that de Broglie thinks of propagating waves, whereas we, if we put
underneath our formulae the idea of vibration, are lead to standing proper oscil-
lations. I have shown recently21 that one can motivate Einstein’s theory of gas by
considering such standing proper oscillations, for which one applies the dispersion
law of the de Broglie phasewave. The above considerations for the atom could have
been represented as a generalisation of those thoughts on the model of gas.
If one interprets the individual functions (18), multiplied with a spherical har-
monic of order n, as the description of processes of proper oscillations, then the
quantity E must have something to do with the frequency of the process in ques-
tion. Now, one is used to the fact that in oscillatory problems the “parameter”
(usually called λ) is proportional to the square of the frequency. But, first, such an
approach would lead in the present case, just for negative values of E, to imaginary
frequencies, second their instinct tells to the quantum theorist, that the energy has
to be proportional to the frequency itself and not to its square.

The contradiction resolves itself in the following way. For the “parameter” E
of the variation equation (5) there is of course no natural fundamental level estab-
lished, especially since the unknown function ψ appears multiplied, a part from
E, also by a function of r which, upon a corresponding change in the fundamental
level of E, can be altered by a constant. Consequently, the “expectation of the
theoretician of the oscillations” must be corrected to the extent that not E itself
— we called it so up to now and want to call it so also in the following — but
E increased by a certain constant is expected to be proportional to the square of
the frequency. Let now this constant be very large with respect to the modules
of all occurring negative values of the energy [which are, of course, constrained
by (15)]. Then, first, the frequencies become real, but, second, our values of the
energy become, since they correspond only to relatively small differences in the
frequencies, really very closely proportional to these differences in the frequency.
On the other hand, this is all the “natural instinct” of the quantum theorist can
demand, as long as the zero level of the energy is not established.

The interpretation that the frequency of the oscillatory process is given by
something of the sort
(22) ν = C′√C + E = C′√C + C′
2√C E + . . .

where C is a constant very large with respect to all the energies, has however an-
other very estimable superiority. It provides an understanding for Bohr’s condition
on the frequency. According to the latter the emission frequencies are indeed pro-
portional to the energy differences, then according to (22) also to the differences

21Published recently in the Physik. Zeitschr.

of the proper frequencies ν of that hypothetical vibration process. And indeed
when the proper frequencies are all very large with respect to the emission fre-
quencies, they match among themselves closely. The emission frequencies appear
thus as deep “difference tones” of the proper oscillations themselves, which take
place with much higher frequency. That by the shift of the energy from one into an-
other normal oscillation something — I mean the lightwave — appears, to which as
frequency is attributed the frequency difference, is very understandable; one needs
only to imagine that the lightwave is causally linked with the beat that necessarily
occur during the transition at every point of space and the frequency of the light
is determined by the frequency with which the maximum of the intensity of the
beat process recurs per second.

It might raise concerns that these conclusions are based on the relation (22)
in its approximated form (upon development of the square root) by which Bohr’s
condition on the frequency itself acquires apparently the character of an approx-
imated formula. However, that is only apparent and is completely avoided when
one develops the relativistic theory by which in the first place a deeper under-
standing is conveyed. The large additive constant C is obviously most intimately
connected with the rest energy mc2 of the electron. Also the apparently reiterated
and independent appearance of the constant h (which already was introduced in
(20)) in the frequency condition is by the relativistic theory clarified, or better,
avoided. But, unfortunately, its complete development encounters at the moment
still certain, above touched, difficulties.

It is barely necessary to emphasise how much nicer would be the idea that in
a quantum transition the energy shifts from one form of oscillation to another,
than the idea of jumping electrons. The variation of the oscillatory form can
constantly realise itself in space and time, according to the experience (canal rays
attempts of W. Wien) it can well last as long as the emission process lasts: and
nevertheless the proper frequencies will be determined, and together with them at
once the oscillatory frequency, if during this transition the atom is subject to an
electromagnetic field for a relatively short time, and only as long as the field is
acting. This experimentally established fact causes, as it is well-known, up to now
the biggest difficulties to the comprehension, cf. for example the discussion in the
known attempt of solution of Bohr-Kramers-Slater.

Further one cannot certainly forget in the joy over the human proximity of
all these things, that the idea that the atom vibrates, if it does not irradiate,
specifically in the form of one proper oscillation, I say that this idea, if it must be
retained, departs itself still very strongly from the natural picture of an oscillating
system. Indeed, as it is well known, a macroscopic system does not certainly
behave itself in such a way, but it delivers in general a potpourri of its proper
frequencies. One cannot however establish rash their opinion about this point.
Also a potpourri of proper frequencies for a single atom would make no difference,
as long as at the same time no other beat frequencies appear as those to whose
emission the atom is fit, according to the experience, under conditions. Also the
simultaneous genuine emission of many of these spectral lines by the same atom
does not contradict any experience. One could well think then that the atom
oscillates only in normal conditions (and approximately in certain “metastable”
conditions) with one frequency and right because of this it does not emit, because, that is to say, no beats occur.
The stimulation would consist in a simultaneous state of excitation of one or
more other proper frequencies through which then beats arise, that call for the
light emission.

Under all circumstances I would like to believe that the eigenfunctions belonging
to the same frequency are in general all excited simultaneously. Multiplicity of
the eigenvalues corresponds namely, in the language of the present day theory,
to the degeneracy. To the reduction of the quantisation of degenerate systems
might correspond the arbitrary distribution of the energy over the eigenfunctions
belonging to one eigenvalue.

Addition by the proofreading on 28. II. 1926.
For the case of the conservative systems of classical mechanics the variation
task can be formulated in a way nicer than that at the beginning, without explicit
relation to the Hamiltonian partial differential equation, as follows. Let T (q, p)
be the kinetic energy as function of the coordinates and of the momenta, V the
potential energy, dτ the volume element of the configuration space “rationalised”,
that is not simply the product dq1, dq2 . . . dqn, but it divided by the square root of
the discriminant of the quadratic form T (q, p). (cf. Gibbs, Statistical Mechanics.)
Then ψ should make the “Hamiltonian integral”

stationary under the normalising additional condition

ψ2dτ = 1 .
The eigenvalues of this variation problem are, as it is well known, the stationary
values of the integral (23) and deliver, according to our thesis, the energy quantum
levels.
Regarding (14′′) let it be still remarked that in the quantity α2 one has es-
sentially before themselves the known Sommerfeld’s expression − B√A + √C (cf.
“Atombau”, 4. Aufl., S. 775).

Applying Laplace transform to equation (7′′)
Recall equation (7′′):
(7′′) d2U
dr2 +
(
δ0 + δ1
r
) dU
dr +
(
ε0 + ε1
r
)
U = 0 .
Let us represent U (r) as follows:
(25) U (r) =
∫
L
dzezrF (z) ,
where L is a suitable integration path on the complex plane of the complex variable
z. Plugging this representation into equation (7′′) one obtains:
(26)
∫
L
dzezr[P (z) + Q(z)r]F (z) = 0 ,
with
(27) P (z) = δ1z + ε1 , Q(z) = z2 + δ0z + ε0 .
Write:
(28) r = d
dz erz ,
and recast the transformed equation (26) as:
(29)∫
L
dz d
dz [ezrQ(z)F (z)] −
∫
L
dzezr [−P (z)F (z) + Q(z)F ′(z) + Q′(z)F (z)] = 0 ,
where the prime denotes derivation with respect to z. The above equation is
satisfied if:
(30) −P (z)F (z) + Q(z)F ′(z) + Q′(z)F (z) = 0 ,
which is the first-order differential equation mentioned by Schr¨odinger in the text,
and
(31)
∫
L
dz d
dz [ezrQ(z)F (z)] = 0 ,
which will turn out to be condition (13). Let us write Q(z) as:
(32) Q(z) = z2 + δ0z + ε0 = (z − c1)(z − c2) ,
where c1 and c2 are, as explained in the text by Schr¨odinger, the roots of Q(z) and
therefore are related to δ0 and ε0 as follows:
(33) c1 + c2 = −δ0 , c1c2 = ε0 .
13
Equation (30) can now indeed be solved by quadrature since it can be cast as
follows:
(34) F ′
F = P − Q′
Q = z(δ1 − 2) + ε1 + c1 + c2
(z − c1)(z − c2) ,
and upon integration, a part an unimportant integration constant, we get:
(35) F = (z − c1)α1−1(z − c2)α2−1 ,
with α1 and α2 given by equation (14′). With this F we reproduce equations (12)
and (13).
