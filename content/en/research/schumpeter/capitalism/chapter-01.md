## PART I The Marxian Doctrine

MOST of the creations of the intellect or fancy pass away for good after an hour or a generation. 

Some, however, do not. They suffer eclipses but they come back again. They come back not as unrecognizable elements of a cultural inheritance.

<!--  but in their individual garb and with their personal scars which people may see
and touch.  -->

These are the great ones. This is applicable to the message of Marx.

<!-- —it is no disadvantage of
this definition that it links greatness to vitality. Taken in this sense, this is
undoubtedly the word to apply to . But there is an
additional advantage to defining  -->

But greatness by revivals makes it independent of our love or hate. 

<!-- We need not believe that a great achievement must necessarily be a source of light or faultless in either
fundamental design or details. On the contrary, we may believe it to be a -->

A great achievement might be from a power of darkness.

<!-- we may think it fundamentally wrong or disagree with
it on any number of particular points.  -->

In the case of the Marxian system, such adverse judgment or even disproof, by its very failure to injure
fatally, only serves to bring out the power of the structure.

The last twenty years have witnessed a most interesting Marxian revival.

The great teacher of the socialist creed came into his own in Soviet Russia.

<!--  is not surprising. And it is only characteristic of such
processes of canonization that there is, between the true meaning of Marx’s
message and bolshevist practice and ideology, at least as great a gulf as there
was between the religion of humble Galileans and the practice and ideology
of the princes of the church or the warlords of the Middle Ages. -->

The Marxian revival in the United States is less easy to explain.

<!-- This phenomenon is so interesting because  -->

Until the twenties, there was no Marxian strain of importance in either the American labor movement or in the thought of the American intellectual. 

What Marxism there was always had been superficial, insignificant and without standing.

<!-- Moreover, the bolshevist type of revival produced no similar spurt in those
countries which had previously been most steeped in Marxology. 

(not only those allied to the Social Democratic party but
also those who went much beyond its cautious conservatism in practical questions)  -->

Germany of all countries had the strongest Marxian tradition.

A small orthodox sect kept alive during the post-war socialist boom as it had during the previous depression. 

But the leaders of socialist thought betrayed little taste for reverting to the old tenets and, while worshiping the deity, took good care to keep it at a distance and to reason in economic matters exactly like other economists.

Outside of Russia, therefore, the American phenomenon stands alone. 

<!-- We are not concerned
with its causes. But it is worth while to survey the contours and the
meaning of the message so many Americans have made their own. 1 -->


Marxism is a religion.

To the believer it presents:

1. A system of ultimate ends that:
- embody the meaning of life
- are absolute standards to judge events and actions by

2. A guide to a plan of salvation.

<!--  and the indication of the evil from
which mankind, or a chosen section of mankind, is to be saved.  -->

Marxist socialism belongs to that subgroup which promises paradise on this side of the grave. 

<!-- I believe that a formulation of these
characteristics by an hierologist would give opportunities for classification and
comment which might possibly lead much deeper into the sociological essence
of Marxism than anything a mere economist can say. -->

<!-- The least important point about this is that it explains the success of
Marxism. 1 Purely scientific achievement, had it even been much more perfect
than it was in the case of Marx, would never have won the immortality in the
historical sense which is his. Nor would his arsenal of party slogans have done
it.  -->

Part of Marx' success is his barrelful of white-hot phrases, of impassioned accusations. 

<!-- All that needs to be said about this aspect of the matter is that this
ammunition has served and is serving its purpose very well, but that the
production of it carried a disadvantage: in order to forge such weapons for the
arena of social strife Marx had occasionally to bend, or to deviate from, the
opinions that would logically follow from his system. However, if Marx had
not been more than a purveyor of phraseology, he would be dead by now.
Mankind is not grateful for that sort of service and forgets quickly the names
of the people who write the librettos for its political operas. -->

<!-- 1 The religious quality of Marxism also explains a characteristic attitude of the orthodox
Marxist toward opponents. To him, as to any believer in a Faith, the opponent is not merely in
error but in sin. Dissent is disapproved of not only intellectually but also morally. There cannot
be any excuse for it once the Message has been revealed. -->

But he was a prophet.

His time was the:
- zenith of bourgeois realization
 <!-- and the nadir of bourgeois civilization, the -->
- time of mechanistic materialism

 <!-- of a cultural milieu which had as yet betrayed no sign that a new art and a new mode of life were in its womb, and which rioted in most repulsive banality.  -->

Faith was rapidly falling away from all classes of society.

<!-- With it, the only ray of light (apart from what may have been derived from Rochdale attitudes and
saving banks) died from the workman’s world, while intellectuals professed
themselves highly satisfied with Mill’s Logic and the Poor Law.

Now, to millions of human hearts the Marxian message of the terrestrial
paradise of socialism meant a new ray of light and a new meaning of life.

Call Marxist religion a counterfeit if you like, or a caricature of faith—there
is plenty to be said for this view—but do not overlook or fail to admire the
greatness of the achievement. Never mind that nearly all of those millions
were unable to understand and appreciate the message in its true significance.
That is the fate of all messages. The important thing is that  -->

<!-- His message was framed and conveyed in such a way as to be acceptable to the positivistic
mind of its time—which was essentially bourgeois no doubt, but there is no
paradox in saying that  -->

Marxism is essentially a product of the bourgeois mind. 

<!-- This was done, on the one hand, by formulating with unsurpassed
force that feeling of being thwarted and ill treated which is the auto-therapeutic attitude of the unsuccessful many, and, on the other hand, by
proclaiming that socialistic deliverance from those ills was a certainty
amenable to rational proof.

Observe how supreme art here succeeds in weaving together those extra-rational cravings which receding religion had left running about like
masterless dogs, and the rationalistic and materialistic tendencies of the time,
ineluctable for the moment, which would not tolerate any creed that had no
scientific or pseudo-scientific connotation. Preaching the goal would have
been ineffectual; analyzing a social process would have interested only a few
hundred specialists. 

But preaching in the garb of analysis and analyzing with
a view to heartfelt needs, this is what conquered passionate allegiance and
gave to the Marxist that supreme boon which consists in the conviction that
what one is and stands for can never be defeated but must conquer
victoriously in the end. This, of course, does not exhaust the achievement.
Personal force and the flash of prophecy work independently of the contents
of the creed. No new life and no new meaning of life can be effectively
revealed without. But this does not concern us here.

Something will have to be said about the cogency and correctness of
Marx’s attempt to prove the inevitability of the socialist goal. One remark,
however, suffices as to what has been called above his  -->

<!-- Marx formulated the feelings of the unsuccessful many. 

But it was not a true formulation of actual feelings, conscious or subconscious.  -->

Marx tried replacing actual feelings by a true or false revelation of the logic of social evolution. 

By doing this and by at tributing—quite unrealistically—to the masses his own shibboleth of “class consciousness,” he undoubtedly falsified 

The true psychology of the workman is that the workman wishes:
- to become a small bourgeois
- to be helped to that status by political force

but in so far as his teaching took effect he also expanded and ennobled it.
He did not weep any sentimental tears about the beauty of the socialist idea.

This is one of his claims to superiority over what he called the Utopian
Socialists. 

He did not glorify the workmen into heroes of daily toil as bourgeois love to do when trembling for their dividends. 

He was free from any tendency, so conspicuous in some of his weaker followers,
toward licking the workman’s boots. 

He had probably a clear perception of
what the masses are and he looked far above their heads toward social goals
altogether beyond what they thought or wanted. 

He never taught any ideals as set by himself. 

Such vanity was quite foreign to him. As every true prophet styles himself the humble mouthpiece of his deity, so Marx pretended no more than to speak the logic of the dialectic process of history.

There is dignity in all this which compensates for many pettinesses and vulgarities with which, in his work and in his life, this dignity formed sostrange an alliance.


<!-- Marx was personally much too civilized to fall in with those vulgar professors of socialism who do
not recognize a temple when they see it. He was perfectly able to understand
a civilization and the “relatively absolute” value of its values, however far
removed from it he may have felt himself to be.  -->


The Communist Manifesto:
- shows:
  - Marx' broad-mindedness.
  - the achievements of capitalism
- pronounced pro futuro death sentence on capitalism

<!-- , he
never failed to recognize its historical necessity. This attitude, of course,
implies quite a lot of things Marx himself would have been unwilling to accept. -->

<!-- But he was undoubtedly strengthened in it, and it was made more easy for him
to take, because of that perception of the organic logic of things to which his theory of history gives one particular expression. Things social fell into order for him, and however much of a coffeehouse conspirator he may have been
at some junctures of his life, his true self despised that sort of thing.  -->

<!-- Socialism for him was no obsession which blots out all other colors of life and creates an unhealthy and stupid hatred or contempt for other civilizations. And there is, in more senses than one, justification for the title claimed for his type of
socialist thought and of socialist volition which are welded together by virtue of his fundamental position:  -->

Marx' socialism is Scientific Socialism.


<!-- 2 “The bourgeoisie…has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about.
It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts and Gothic
cathedrals…. The bourgeoisie… draws all nations…into civilization…. It has created enormous
cities… and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic!] of rural
life…. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive
and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together.” All the achievements referred to are attributed to the bourgeoisie alone which is more than many thoroughly bourgeois economists would claim. This is all I meant by the above passage—and strikingly different from the views of the vulgarized Marxism of today or from the Veblenite
stuff of the modern non-Marxist radical. Not more than that is implied in
anything I shall say in the second part about the performance of capitalism. -->
