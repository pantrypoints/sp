<!-- WE HAVE now to do a thing which is very objectionable to the faithful.

They naturally resent any application of cold analysis to what for them
is the very fountain of truth. 

But one of the things they resent most is cutting Marx’s work into pieces and discussing them one by one. They would say that the very act displays the incapacity of the bourgeois to grasp the
resplendent whole, all parts of which complement and explain one another,
so that the true meaning is missed as soon as any one part or aspect is
considered by itself. 

We have no choice, however. By committing the offense
and next taking up Marx the sociologist after Marx the prophet, I do not
mean to deny either the presence of a unity of social vision which succeeds
in giving some measure of analytic unity, and still more a semblance of unity,
to the Marxian work, or the fact that every part of it, however independent
intrinsically, has been correlated by the author with every other. 

Enough independence remains nevertheless in every province of the vast realm to
make it possible for the student to accept the fruits of his labors in one of
them while rejecting those in another. 

Much of the glamour of the faith is lost in the process but something is gained by salvaging important and
stimulating truth which is much more valuable by itself than it would be if
tied to hopeless wreckage.

This applies first of all to Marx’s philosophy which we may as well get out
of our way once and for all. German-trained and speculative-minded as he was,
he had a thorough grounding and a passionate interest in philosophy.  -->

Pure German philosophy was Marx' starting point.

He was a Neo-Hegelian.
- He accepted his master Hegel's fundamental attitudes and methods.
- But he and his group replaced, with opposites, the conservative interpretations of Hegel’s philosophy

<!-- This background shows in all his writings wherever the opportunity offers itself. It is no wonder that his German and
Russian readers, by bent of mind and training similarly disposed, should seize
primarily upon this element and make it the master key to the system.
I believe this to be a mistake and an injustice to Marx’s scientific powers.
He retained his early love during the whole of his lifetime. He enjoyed
certain formal analogies which may be found between his and Hegel’s argument.  -->

He used Hegelian phraseology. But this is all. 

He never betrayed positive science for metaphysics. 

<!-- He says himself as much in the preface to the second edition
of the first volume of Das Kapital, and that what he says there is true and
no self-delusion can be proved by analyzing his argument, which everywhere
rests upon social fact, and the true sources of his propositions none of which
lies in the domain of philosophy. Of course, those commentators or critics
who themselves started from the philosophic side were unable to do this
because they did not know enough about the social sciences involved. The
propensity of the philosophic system-builder, moreover, made them averse
to any other interpretation but the one which proceeds from some
philosophic principle. So they saw philosophy in the most matter-of-fact
statements about economic experience, thereby shunting discussion on to the
wrong track, misleading friends and foes alike. -->

Marx the sociologist used his extensive command of historical and contemporaneous facts for his aims.

<!-- His knowledge of the latter was always somewhat
antiquated, for he was the most bookish of men and therefore fundamental
materials, as distinguished from the material of the newspapers, always reached
him with a lag.  -->

<!-- But hardly any historical work of his time that was of any
general importance or scope escaped him, although much of the monographic
literature did. While we cannot extol the completeness of his information in
this field as much as we shall his erudition in the field of economic theory, he
was yet able to illustrate his social visions not only by large historical frescoes
but also by many details most of which were as regards reliability rather above
than below the standards of other sociologists of his time. These facts he
embraced with a glance that pierced through the random irregularities of the
surface down to the grandiose logic of things historical. In this there was not
merely passion. There was not merely analytic impulse. There were both. And
the outcome of his attempt to formulate that logic, the so-called Economic
Interpretation of History, 1 is doubtless one of the greatest individual
achievements of sociology to this day. Before it, the question sinks into
insignificance whether or not this achievement was entirely original and how
far credit has in part to be given to predecessors, German and French. -->


<!-- 1 First published in that scathing attack on Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère, entitled
Das Elend der Philosophie, 1847. Another version was included in the Communist
Manifesto, 1848. -->

The economic interpretation of history does not mean that men are, consciously or unconsciously, wholly or primarily, actuated by economic motives. 

On the contrary, the explanation of the role and mechanism of non-economic motives and the analysis of the way in which social reality mirrors itself in the individual psyches is an essential element of the theory and one of its most significant contributions. 

Marx did not hold that religions, metaphysics, schools of art, ethical ideas and political volitions were either reducible to economic motives or of no importance. 

He only tried to unveil the economic conditions which shape them and which account for their rise and fall. 

The whole of Max Weber’s facts and arguments fits perfectly into Marx’s system.

Social groups and classes and the ways in which these groups or classes explain to themselves their own existence, location and behavior were of course what interested him most. 

He poured the vials of his most bilious wrath on the historians who took those attitudes and their verbalizations (the ideologies or, as Pareto would have said, derivations) at their face value and who tried to interpret social reality by means of them. 

But if ideas or values were not for him the prime movers of the social process, neither were they mere smoke. 

In the social engine, they were the transmission belts.

We cannot touch upon that
most interesting post-war development of these principles which would
afford the best instance by which to explain this, the Sociology of
Knowledge. 3 

But it was necessary to say this much because Marx has been
persistently misunderstood in this respect. 

Even Engels, at the open grave of Marx, defined the theory as meaning that individuals and groups are swayed primarily by economic motives.

But this is wrong. 

 <!-- which in some important respects is wrong and for the rest piteously trivial. -->

<!-- While we are about it, we may as well defend Marx against another
misunderstanding:  -->

Marx called the economic interpretation of history as the materialistic interpretation. 

But it is entirely meaningless. 

Marx’s philosophy is no more materialistic than is Hegel’s.*

{{< n n="Schumpeter obviously doesn't know Hegel which he stupidly equates to religious belief!" >}}


His theory of history is not more materialistic than is any other attempt to account for the historic process by
the means at the command of empirical science. 

This is logically compatible with any metaphysical or religious belief—exactly as any physical picture of the world is. 

Medieval theology itself supplies methods by which it is possible to establish this compatibility.4

to his famous study. Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus, republished in
his collected works.
3 The German word is Wissenssoziologie, and the best names to mention are those of Max
Scheler and Karl Mannheim. The latter’s article on the subject in the German Dictionary of
Sociology (Handwörterbuch der Soziologie) can serve as an introduction. -->
