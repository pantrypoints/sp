<!-- THE main components of the Marxian structure are now before us. What
about the imposing synthesis as a whole? The question is not otiose. If
ever it is true, it is in this case that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.


Moreover, the synthesis may have so spoiled the wheat or so utilized the chaff,
both of which are present in almost every spot, that the whole might be more
true or more false than any part of it is, taken by itself. Finally, there is the
Message that proceeds only from the whole. Of the latter however no more
will be said. 

Each of us must settle for himself what it means to him.

Our time revolts against the inexorable necessity of specialization and
therefore cries out for synthesis, nowhere so loudly as in the social sciences
in which the non-professional element counts for so much. 1 But Marx’s
system illustrates well that, though synthesis may mean new light, it also
means new fetters. -->

In the Marxian argument sociology and economics pervade each other. 

In intent and in actual practice, they are one.

All the major concepts and propositions are hence both economic
and sociological and carry the same meaning on both planes—if, from our
standpoint, we may still speak of two planes of argument. 

Thus, the
economic category “labor” and the social class “proletariat” are, on principle
at least, made congruent, in fact identical. 

Or the economists’ functional
distribution—that is to say, the explanation of the way in which incomes
emerge as returns to productive services irrespective of what social class any
recipient of such a return may belong to—enters the Marxian system only
in the form of distribution between social classes and thus acquires a
different connotation. Or capital in the Marxian system is capital only if in
the hands of a distinct capitalist class. The same things, if in the hands of
the workmen, are not capital.

There cannot be any doubt about the access of vitality which comes to
analysis thereby. The ghostly concepts of economic theory begin to breathe.

<!--  1 The non-professional element is particularly strongly represented among those admirers
of Marx who, going beyond the attitude of the typical Marxian economist, still take at face value
everything he wrote. This is very significant. In every national group of Marxists there are at
least three laymen to every trained economist and even this economist is as a rule a Marxist
only in that qualified sense defined in the introduction to this part: he worships at the shrine,
but he turns his back upon it when he does his research. -->

The bloodless theorem descends into agmen, pulverem et clamorem; without
losing its logical quality, it is no longer a mere proposition about the logical
properties of a system of abstractions; it is the stroke of a brush that is
painting the wild jumble of social life. Such analysis conveys not only richer
meaning of what all economic analysis describes but it embraces a much
broader field—it draws every kind of class action into its picture, whether
or not this class action conforms to the ordinary rules of business procedure.

Wars, revolutions, legislation of all types, changes in the structure of governments, in short all the things that non-Marxian economics treats
simply as external disturbances do find their places side by side with, say,
investment in machinery or bargains with labor—everything is covered by
a single explanatory schema.

At the same time, such procedure has its shortcomings. Conceptual
arrangements that are subject to a yoke of this kind may easily lose in
efficiency as much as they gain in vividness. The pair, worker-proletarian, may
serve as a telling if somewhat trite example. 

In non-Marxian economics all
returns to services of persons partake of the nature of wages, whether those
persons are tophole lawyers, movie stars, company executives or street
sweepers. 

Since all these returns have, from the standpoint of the economic
phenomenon involved, much in common, this generalization is not futile or
sterile. On the contrary, it may be enlightening, even for the sociological aspect
of things. But by equating labor and proletariat we obscure it; in fact, we
entirely banish it from our picture. 

Similarly, a valuable economic theorem
may by its sociological metamorphosis pick up error instead of richer meaning
and vice versa. 

Thus, synthesis in general and synthesis on Marxian lines in
particular might easily issue in both worse economics and worse sociology.
Synthesis in general, i.e., coordination of the methods and results of
different lines of advance, is a difficult thing which few are competent to
tackle. 

In consequence it is ordinarily not tackled at all and from the students
who are taught to see only individual trees we hear discontented clamor for
the forest. They fail to realize however that the trouble is in part an embarras
de richesse and that the synthetic forest may look uncommonly like an
intellectual concentration camp.

Synthesis on Marxian lines, i.e., coordination of economic and sociological
analysis with a view to bending everything to a single purpose, is of course
particularly apt to look like that. 

The purpose—that histoire raisonnée of capitalist society—is wide enough but the analytic setup is not. There is indeed
a grand wedding of political facts and of economic theorems; 

But they are wedded by force and neither of them can breathe. 

Marxists claim that their system solves all the great problems that baffle non-Marxian economics.

But it really solves it by emasculating the problems.
