Two examples will illustrate the merits and the demerits of the Marxian synthesis as a problem-solving engine.

1. The Marxist theory of Imperialism

<!-- Its roots are all
to be found in Marx’s chief work, but it has been developed by the Neo-
Marxist school which flourished in the first two decades of this century and,
without renouncing communion with the old defenders of the faith, such as
Karl Kautsky, did much to overhaul the system.  -->

Vienna was its center; Otto Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding, Max Adler were its leaders. 

<!-- In the field of imperialism their work was continued, with but secondary shifts of emphasis,
by many others, prominent among whom were Rosa Luxemburg and Fritz
Sternberg.  -->

The argument runs as follows.

Capitalist society cannot exist. 

Its economic system cannot function without profits.

But profits are constantly being eliminated by the very working of that system.

And so the central aim of the capitalist class is to keep profits alive. 

Accumulation accompanied by qualitative change in the composition of capital is a remedy.
- This temporarily alleviates the situation of the individual capitalist.
- But it makes matters worse in the end.

So capital falls as it yields to the pressure of a falling rate of profits.

This is because:
- constant capital increases relative to variable capital 
- if wages rise and hours are shortened, then value falls

Capital will seek countries with cheap labor and little mechanization.

Thus, capital is exported into undeveloped countries.

<!--  which is essentially an export of capital equipment or of
consumers’ goods to be used in order to buy labor or to acquire things
with which to buy labor. 3  -->

<!-- the rate of surplus groups were in most cases wholly, in all cases mainly, interested in economic theory. This
performance is hence incommensurable with Marx’s synthesis. It could only be compared with
Marx’s theoretical apparatus and in that field comparison is all to their advantage. -->

<!-- But it is also export of capital in the ordinary
sense of the term because the exported commodities will not be paid
for—at least not immediately—by goods, services or money from the
importing country.  -->

It turns into colonization if the undeveloped country is brought into political subjection in order to safeguard the investment against:
- the hostile natives
- competition from other capitalist countries

<!-- This is in general accomplished by military force supplied either by the colonizing capitalists themselves or by their home government which thus lives up to the definition given in the Communist Manifesto: “the executive of the modern State [is]…a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.” Of course, that force will not be used for defensive purposes only. There will be conquest, friction between the capitalist countries and internecine war between rival bourgeoisies. -->


Colonial expansion is prompted by a falling rate of profit in the capitalist countries.

<!-- It should occur in the later stages of capitalist evolution. -->

And so Marxists speak of imperialism as the last stage of capitalism. 

<!-- Hence it would coincide with a
high degree of concentration of capitalist control over industry and with
a decline of the type of competition that characterized the times of the
small or medium-sized firm.  -->

Marx did not stress the resulting tendency toward:
- monopolistic restriction of output
- protecting the domestic game preserve against the intrusion of poachers from other capitalist countries. 

<!-- Perhaps
he was too competent an economist to trust this line of argument too far. -->

But the Neo-Marxists did.

<!--  were glad to avail themselves of it. Thus we get
not only another stimulus for imperialist policy and another source of
imperialist imbroglios but also, as a by-product, a theory of a phenomenon that is not necessarily imperialist in itself,  -->

This leads to modern protectionism.

<!-- 3 Think of luxuries to be traded to chieftains against slaves or to be traded against wage
goods with which to hire native labor. For the sake of brevity, I do not take account of the fact
that capital export in the sense envisaged will in general arise as a part of the total trade of
the two countries which also includes commodity transactions unconnected with the particular
process we have in mind. These transactions of course greatly facilitate that capital export, but
do not affect its principle. I shall also neglect other types of capital exports. The theory under
discussion is not, and is not intended to be, a general theory of international trade and finance. -->

Note one more hitch in that process that will stand the Marxist in good
stead in the task of explaining further difficulties. When the undeveloped
countries have been developed, capital export of the kind we have been
considering will decline. 

There may then be a period during which the
mother country and the colony will exchange, say, manufactured products
for raw materials. 

But in the end the exports of manufacturers will also
have to decline while colonial competition will assert itself in the mother
country. 

Attempts to retard the advent of that state of things will provide
further sources of friction, this time between each old capitalist country and
its colonies, of wars of independence and so on. 

But in any case colonial
doors will eventually be closed to domestic capital which will no longer
be able to flee from vanishing profits at home into richer pastures abroad.

Lack of outlets, excess capacity, complete deadlock, in the end regular
recurrence of national bankruptcies and other disasters—perhaps world
wars from sheer capitalist despair—may confidently be anticipated. 

History
is as simple as that.
