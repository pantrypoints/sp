<!-- This theory is a fair—perhaps it is the best—example of the way in
which the  attempts to solve problems and acquires
authority by doing so. The whole thing seems to follow beautifully from
two  premises that are both firmly embedded in the
groundwork of the system:  -->

Marxian synthesis has 2 fundamental premises:

1. The theory of classes
2. The theory of accumulation


## Classes

Class action:
- always remains intrinsically the same.
- becomes political or business action according to tactical methods and phraseology

If it is more profitable for capitalists to:
- negotiate a loan, then a loan will be negotiated 
- make war, war will be made

<!-- If, the
means and opportunities being what they are, it is more profitable to  -->

War is valid in economic theory as loans.

Even mere protectionism now grows out of the logic of capitalist evolution.

Moreover, this theory displays to full advantage a virtue that it has in
common with most of the Marxian concepts in the field of what is usually
referred to as applied economics. 

This is its close alliance with historical and
contemporaneous fact. Probably not one reader has perused my résumé
without being struck by the ease with which supporting historical instances
crowded in upon him at every single step of the argument. 

Has he not heard of the oppression by Europeans of native labor in many parts of the world,
of what South and Central American Indians suffered at the hands of the
Spaniards for instance, or of slave-hunting and slave-trading and coolieism?
Is capital export not actually ever-present in capitalist countries? Has it not
almost invariably been accompanied by military conquest that served to
subdue the natives and to fight other European powers? Has not colonization
always had a rather conspicuous military side, even when managed entirely
by business corporations such as the East India Company or the British
South Africa Company? What better illustration could Marx himself have
desired than Cecil Rhodes and the Boer War? Is it not pretty obvious that
colonial ambitions were, to say the least, an important factor in European
troubles, at all events since about 1700? As for the present time, who has
not heard, on the one hand, about the “strategy of raw materials” and, on
the other hand, of the repercussions on Europe of the growth of native
capitalism in the tropics? And so on. As to protectionism—well, that is as
plain as anything can be.

But we had better be careful. An apparent verification by prima facie
favorable cases which are not analyzed in detail may be very deceptive.
Moreover, as every lawyer and every politician knows, energetic appeal to
familiar facts will go a long way toward inducing a jury or a parliament to
accept also the construction he desires to put upon them. Marxists have
exploited this technique to the full. In this instance it is particularly
successful, because the facts in question combine the virtues of being
superficially known to everyone and of being thoroughly understood by very
few. In fact, though we cannot enter into detailed discussion here, even hasty
reflection suffices to suggest a suspicion that “it is not so.”

A few remarks will be made in the next part on the relation in which the
bourgeoisie stands to imperialism. We shall now consider the question
whether, if the Marxian interpretation of capital export, colonization and
protectionism were correct, it would also be adequate as a theory of all the
phenomena we think of when using that loose and misused term. Of course
we can always define imperialism in such a way as to mean just what the
Marxian interpretation implies; and we can always profess ourselves
convinced that all those phenomena must be explainable in the Marxian
manner. But then the problem of imperialism—always granting that the
4 The danger of empty tautologies being put over on us is best illustrated by individual cases.
Thus, France conquered Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, and Italy conquered Abyssinia, by
military force without there being any significant capitalist interests to press for it. As a matter
of fact, presence of such interests was a pretense that was very difficult to establish, and the
subsequent development of such interests was a slow process that went on, unsatisfactorily
enough, under government pressure. If that should not look very Marxist, it will be replied that
action was taken under pressure of potential or anticipated capitalist interests or that in the last theory is in itself correct—would be “solved” only tautologically. 4 

Whether
the Marxian approach or, for that matter, any purely economic approach
yields a solution that is not tautological would still have to be considered
This, however, need not concern us here, because the ground gives way
before we get that far.



The Marxist theory seems to fit some cases well.

The most important instances are afforded by the English and Dutch conquests in the tropics. 

But other cases, such as the colonization of New England,
it does not fit at all. And even the former type of case is not satisfactorily
described by the Marxian theory of imperialism. It would obviously not
suffice to recognize that the lure of gain played a role in motivating
colonial expansion. 5 

The Neo-Marxists did not mean to aver such a horrible platitude. If these cases are to count for them, it is also necessary that
colonial expansion came about, in the way indicated, under pressure of
accumulation on the rate of profit, hence as a feature of decaying, or at
all events of fully matured, capitalism. 

But the heroic time of colonial
adventure was precisely the time of early and immature capitalism when
accumulation was in its beginnings and any such pressure—also, in
particular, any barrier to exploitation of domestic labor—was conspicuous
by its absence. The element of monopoly was not absent. On the contrary
it was far more evident than it is today. 

But that only adds to the absurdity
of the construction which makes both monopoly and conquest specific
properties of latter-day capitalism.

Moreover, the other leg of the theory, class struggle, is in no better
condition. One must wear blinkers to concentrate on that aspect of colonial
expansion which hardly ever played more than a secondary role, and to
construe in terms of class struggle a phenomenon which affords some of
the most striking instances of class cooperation. 

It was as much a
movement toward higher wages as it was a movement toward higher
profits, and in the long run it certainly benefited (in part because of the
exploitation of native labor) the proletariat more than it benefited the
analysis some capitalist interest or objective necessity “must” have been at the bottom of it.
And we can then hunt for corroboratory evidence that will never be entirely lacking, since
capitalist interests, like any others, will in fact be affected by, and take advantage of, any
situation whatsoever, and since the particular conditions of the capitalist organism will always
present some features which may without absurdity be linked up with those policies of national
expansion. 

Evidently it is preconceived conviction and nothing else that keeps us going in a
task as desperate as this; without such a conviction it would never occur to us to embark upon
capitalist interest. But I do not wish to stress its effects. The essential point
is that its causation has not much to do with class warfare, and not more
to do with class structure than is implied in the leadership of groups and
individuals that belonged to, or by colonial enterprise rose into, the
capitalist class. If however we shake off the blinkers and cease to look
upon colonization or imperialism as a mere incident in class warfare, little
remains that is specifically Marxist about the matter. What Adam Smith has
to say on it does just as well—better in fact.


<!-- 5 Nor is it sufficient to stress the fact that each country actually did “exploit” its colonies.
For that was exploitation of a country as a whole by a country as a whole (of all classes by all
classes) and has nothing to do with the specifically Marxian kind of exploitation. it. And we
really need not take the trouble; we might just as well say that “it must be so” and leave it at
that. This is what I meant by tautological explanation. -->


The by-product, the Neo-Marxian theory of modern protectionism,
still remains. 

<!-- Classical literature is full of invectives against the
“sinister interests”—at that time mainly, but never wholly, the agrarian
interests—which in clamoring for protection committed the
unforgivable crime against public welfare.  -->

Thus the classics had a causal theory of protection all right—not only a theory of its effects—
and if now we add the protectionist interests of modern big business we
have gone as far as it is reasonable to go.
