The theories of monopolistic and oligopolistic competition show in 2 ways that capitalism is unfavorable to maximum performance in production.

1. A belief that it always has been so.

This believes that output has been expanding despite the secular sabotage from the managing bourgeoisie. 

Advocates of this proposition would have to produce evidence that the rate of increase is from favorable circumstances unconnected with private enterprise, strong enough to overcome the latter’s resistance.

<!-- This is precisely the question which we shall discuss in Chapter 9. -->

<!-- However, those who espouse this variant at least avoid the trouble about historical fact that the advocates of the alternative proposition have to face. -->

2. Capitalism once favored maximum productive performance but the later spread of monopolist structures killed competition, reversing that tendency.

<!-- , or at all events productive performance so considerable as to
constitute a major element in any serious appraisal of the system;  -->

This belief involves the ideas that:
- the creation of an imaginary golden age of perfect competition that at some time somehow metamorphosed itself into the monopolistic age.
- the rate of increase in output did not decrease from the nineties
- there was no “break in trend”
- most importantly, the modern standard of life of the masses evolved during the period of relatively unfettered “big business.”

 <!-- from which, I suppose, the prevalence of the largest-size concerns, at least in manufacturing industry, would have to be dated; that -->

<!-- is nothing in the behavior of the time series of total output to suggest a ; and, most important of all,  -->

If we list the budget items of the modern workman from 1899 based on the hours of labor that will buy them, the rate of the advance was greater than before

<!-- —i.e., each year’s money prices divided by each year’s hourly wage rates—we cannot fail to be struck by

<!--  whereas it is quite clear that perfect competition has
at no time been more of a reality than it is at present.  -->


If we economists were given less to wishful thinking and more to the observation of facts, doubts would immediately arise as to the realistic virtues of a theory that would have led us to expect a very different result.

If we go into details of the individual items, the trail leads not to the firms in free competition but to the large concerns such as agricultural machinery.

It shows that big business created that standard of life instead of keeping it down.*

The conclusions at the end of Chapter 6 are almost completely false.

Yet they follow from observations and theorems that are almost completely true. 

<!-- Both economists and popular writers have once more run away with some fragments of reality they happened to grasp. These fragments themselves were mostly seen correctly. Their formal properties were mostly developed correctly. But no conclusions about capitalist reality as a whole follow from such fragmentary analyses. If we draw them nevertheless, we can be right only by accident. That has been done. 

The lucky accident did not happen. -->

The essential point is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process. 

It may seem strange that anyone can fail to see so obvious a fact which was long ago emphasized by Marx.

<!-- Yet that fragmentary analysis which yields the bulk of our
propositions about the functioning of modern capitalism persistently neglects
it. Let us restate the point and see how it bears upon our problem. -->

Capitalism is by nature a method of economic change.

It is never and can never be stationary.



Economic life goes on in a social and natural environment which changes (wars, revolutions and so on).
- These changes alter the data of economic action and often condition industrial change.
- But these changes are not the not the prime movers of economic life.

 <!-- this fact is important and these changes -->

The evolutionary character of the capitalist process is not merely:
- from such [social] changes.
- due to a quasi-automatic increase in population and capital 
- due to the vagaries of monetary systems which are also affected by changes

 <!-- of which exactly the same thing holds true -->

The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine* in motion comes from:
- the new consumers’ goods
- the new methods of production or transportation
- the new markets
- the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.

<!-- 1 Those observations and theorems are not satisfactory. The
usual expositions of the doctrine of imperfect competition fail in particular to give due attention
to the many and important cases in which, even as a matter of static theory, imperfect
competition approximates the results of perfect competition. There are other cases in which it
does not do this, but offers compensations which, while not entering any output index, yet
contribute to what the output index is in the last resort intended to measure—the cases in which
a firm defends its market by establishing a name for quality and service for instance. However,
in order to simplify matters, we will not take issue with that doctrine on its own ground. -->


The contents of the laborer’s budget from 1760 to 1940 did not simply grow on unchanging lines.

Instead, they had a qualitative change.

Similarly, the history of the productive apparatus of a typical farm is a history of revolutions from:
- the start of crop rotation, plowing and fattening
- to the mechanized thing of today

So is the history of the productive apparatus of the iron and steel industry from the charcoal furnace to our own type of furnace, or the history of the apparatus of power production from the overshot water wheel to the modern power plant, or the history of transportation from the mailcoach to the airplane. 

In the steel industry, I call this qualitative change as industrial mutation.

It includes:
- the opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic
- the organizational development from the craft shop and factory into U.S. Steel

This incessantly:
- revolutionizes the economic structure from within
- destroys the old one
- creates a new one

This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.*

<!-- It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.  -->

This affects our problem in 2 ways.

1. Every element of this process takes considerable time in revealing its ultimate effects.

This means there is no point in appraising the performance of that process ex visu of a given point of time.

Instead, we must judge its performance over decades or centuries.

A system might focus on short run performance. In the long run, it might become inferior to a system that focuses on long-run performance.

<!-- fully utilize its possibilities to the best advantage at every time.  -->

<!-- the  does so at no given point
of time, because the latter’s failure to do so may be a condition for the level
or speed of  -->

2. This is an organic process.

<!--  analysis of what
happens in any particular part of it—say, in an individual concern or
industry—may indeed clarify details of mechanism but is inconclusive
beyond that.  -->

Every business strategy:
- is significant only against the situation that created it
- must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction
- cannot be taken without that gale on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.

<!-- 2 Those revolutions are not strictly incessant; they occur in discrete rushes which are
separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet. The process as a whole works
incessantly however, in the sense that there always is either revolution or absorption of the
results of revolution, both together forming what are known as business cycles.  -->


But economists who, ex visu of a point of time, look for example at the
behavior of 

An oligopolist industry consists of a few big firms.

An economist might see that the well-known moves and countermoves within it prove a perennial lull.

<!-- seem to aim at nothing but high prices and restrictions of output are making
precisely that hypothesis.  -->

They:
- accept the data of the momentary situation as if there were no past or future to it
- interpret the firms' behaviors through the principle of maximizing profits with reference to those data and think they understand it

The usual theorist’s paper and the usual government commission’s report practically never try to see that behavior, on the one hand, as a result of a piece of past history and, on the other hand, as an attempt to deal with a situation that is sure to change presently—as an attempt by those firms to keep on their feet, on ground that is slipping away from under them.

In other words, the problem that is being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures.

Whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them.

As long as this is not recognized, the investigator does a meaningless job.*

{{< n n="Schumpeter exposes that he is a Hegelian Capitalist which opposes the Hegelian Communist called Marx" >}}

As soon as it is recognized, his outlook on capitalist practice and its social results changes considerably. 3

The first thing to go is the traditional conception of the modus operandi of competition. Economists are at long last emerging from the stage in which price competition was all they saw. 

As soon as quality competition and sales effort are admitted into the sacred precincts of theory, the price variable is ousted from its dominant position. However, it is still competition within a rigid pattern of invariant conditions, methods of production and forms of industrial organization in particular, that practically monopolizes attention.

But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not
that kind of competition which counts but the competition from the new
commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of
organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance)—competition
which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not
at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their
foundations and their very lives. This kind of competition is as much more
effective than the other as a bombardment is in comparison with forcing a door, and so much more important that it becomes a matter of comparative
indifference whether competition in the ordinary sense functions more or less
promptly; the powerful lever that in the long run expands output and brings
down prices is in any case made of other stuff.

<!-- 3 It should be understood that it is only our appraisal of economic performance and not our
moral judgment that can be so changed. Owing to its autonomy, moral approval or disapproval
is entirely independent of our appraisal of social (or any other) results, unless we happen to
adopt a moral system such as utilitarianism which makes moral approval and disapproval turn
on them ex definitions. -->

It is hardly necessary to point out that competition of the kind we now
have in mind acts not only when in being but also when it is merely an ever-
present threat. It disciplines before it attacks. The businessman feels himself
to be in a competitive situation even if he is alone in his field or if, though
not alone, he holds a position such that investigating government experts fail
to see any effective competition between him and any other firms in the same
or a neighboring field and in consequence conclude that his talk, under
examination, about his competitive sorrows is all make-believe. In many
cases, though not in all, this will in the long run enforce behavior very
similar to the perfectly competitive pattern.

Many theorists take the opposite view which is best conveyed by an
example. Let us assume that there is a certain number of retailers in a
neighborhood who try to improve their relative position by service and
“atmosphere” but avoid price competition and stick as to methods to the local
tradition—a picture of stagnating routine. As others drift into the trade that
quasi-equilibrium is indeed upset, but in a manner that does not benefit their
customers. The economic space around each of the shops having been
narrowed, their owners will no longer be able to make a living and they will
try to mend the case by raising prices in tacit agreement. This will further
reduce their sales and so, by successive pyramiding, a situation will evolve
in which increasing potential supply will be attended by increasing instead
of decreasing prices and by decreasing instead of increasing sales.
Such cases do occur, and it is right and proper to work them out. But as
the practical instances usually given show, they are fringe-end cases to be
found mainly in the sectors furthest removed from all that is most
characteristic of capitalist activity.4 Moreover, they are transient by nature.
In the case of retail trade the competition that matters arises not from
additional shops of the same type, but from the department store, the chain
store, the mail-order house and the supermarket which are bound to destroy
those pyramids sooner or later. 5

<!-- 4 This is also shown by a theorem we frequently meet with in expositions of the theory of
imperfect competition, viz., the theorem that, under conditions of imperfect competition,
producing or trading businesses tend to be irrationally small. Since imperfect competition is at
the same time held to be an outstanding characteristic of modern industry we are set to
wondering what world these theorists live in, unless, as stated above, fringe-end cases are all
they have in mind.
5 The mere threat of their attack cannot, in the particular conditions, environmental and
personal, of small-scale retail trade, have its usual disciplining influence, for the small man is
too much hampered by his cost structure and, however well he may manage within his -->

Now a theoretical construction which neglects this essential element of
the case neglects all that is most typically capitalist about it; even if correct
in logic as well as in fact, it is like Hamlet without the Danish prince.
inescapable limitations, he can never adapt him self to the methods of competitors who can
afford to sell at the price at which he buys.
