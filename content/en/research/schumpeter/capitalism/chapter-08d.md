4. Another Marxist doctrine is that in the era of big business, the chief aim of entrepreneurial activity becomes:
- the maintenance of the value of existing investment as the conservation of capital
- stopping all cost-reducing improvement

Hence, the capitalist order becomes incompatible with progress.

Progress entails destruction of capital values in the strata with which the new commodity or method of production competes.

In perfect competition, the old investments must be adapted at a sacrifice or abandoned; but when there is no perfect competition and when each industrial field is controlled by a few big concerns, these can in various ways fight the threatening attack on their capital structure and try to avoid losses on their capital accounts; that is to say, they can and will fight progress itself.

So far as this doctrine merely formulates a particular aspect of restrictive business strategy, there is no need to add anything to the argument already sketched in this chapter. Both as to the limits of that strategy and as to its functions in the process of creative destruction, we should only be repeating what has been said before. This becomes still more obvious if we observe that conserving capital values is the same thing as conserving profits. Modern theory tends in fact to use the concept Present Net Value of Assets (=capital values) in place of the concept of Profits. Both asset values and profits are of course not being simply conserved but maximized.

But the point about the sabotage of cost-reducing improvement still calls for comment in passing. As a little reflection will show, it is sufficient to consider the case of a concern that controls a technological device—some patent, say—the use of which would involve scrapping some or all of its plant and equipment. Will it, in order to conserve its capital values, refrain from using this device when a management not fettered by capitalist interests such as a socialist management could and would use it to the advantage of all?

The first thing a modern concern does as soon as it feels that it can afford it is to establish a research
department every member of which knows that his bread and butter depends
on his success in devising improvements. This practice does not obviously
suggest aversion to technological progress. Nor can we in reply be referred
to the cases in which patents acquired by business concerns have not been
used promptly or not been used at all. For there may be perfectly good
reasons for this; for example, the patented process may turn out to be no
good or at least not to be in shape to warrant application on a commercial basis. Neither the inventors themselves nor the investigating economists or
government officials are unbiased judges of this, and from their
remonstrances or reports we may easily get a very distorted picture. 13
But we are concerned with a question of theory. Everyone agrees that
private and socialist managements will introduce improvements if, with the
new method of production, the total cost per unit of product is expected to
be smaller than the prime cost per unit of product with the method actually
in use. If this condition is not fulfilled, then it is held that private
management will not adopt a cost-reducing method until the existing plant
and equipment is entirely written off, whereas socialist management would,
to the social advantage, replace the old by any new cost-reducing method
as soon as such a method becomes available, i.e., without regard to capital
values. This however is not so. 14

<!-- Monopolistic Practices 97 -->

Private management, if actuated by the profit motive, cannot be interested in maintaining the values of any given building or machine any more than a socialist management would be. All that private management tries to do is to maximize the present net value of total assets which is equal to the discounted value of expected net returns. This amounts to saying that it will always adopt a new method of production which it believes will yield a larger stream of future income per unit of the corresponding stream of future outlay, both discounted to the present, than does the method actually in use. The value of past investment, whether or not paralleled by a bonded debt that has to be amortized, does not enter at all except in the sense and to the extent that it would also have to enter into the calculation underlying the decisions of a socialist management. So far as the use of the old machines saves future costs as compared with the immediate introduction of the new methods, the remainder of their service value is of course an element of the decision for both the capitalist and the socialist manager; otherwise bygones are bygones for both of them and any attempt to conserve the value of past investment would conflict as much with the rules following from the profit motive as it would conflict with the rules set for the behavior of the socialist manager.

13 Incidentally, it should be noticed that the kind of restrictive practice under discussion,
granted that it exists to a significant extent, would not be without compensatory effects on
social welfare. In fact, the same critics who talk about sabotage of progress at the same time
emphasize the social losses incident to the pace of capitalist progress, particularly the
unemployment which that pace entails and which slower advance might mitigate to some
extent. Well, is technological progress too quick or too slow for them? They had better make
up their minds.

<!-- 14 It should be observed that even if the argument were correct, it would still be inadequate
to support the thesis that capitalism is, under the conditions envisaged, “incompatible with
technological progress.” All that it would prove is, for some cases, the presence of a lag of
ordinarily moderate length in the introduction of new methods. -->

It is however not true that private firms owning equipment the value of
which is endangered by a new method which they also control—if they do
not control it, there is no problem and no indictment—will adopt the new
method only if total unit cost with it is smaller than prime unit cost with
the old one, or if the old investment has been completely written off
according to the schedule decided on before the new method presented
itself. For if the new machines when installed are expected to outlive the
rest of the period previously set for the use of the old machines, their
discounted remainder value as of that date is another asset to be taken
account of. Nor is it true, for analogous reasons, that a socialist
management, if acting rationally, would always and immediately adopt any
new method which promises to produce at smaller total unit costs or that
this would be to the social advantage.

There is however another element15 which profoundly affects behavior in
this matter and which is being invariably overlooked. This is what might be
called ex ante conservation of capital in expectation of further improvement.
Frequently, if not in most cases, a going concern does not simply face the
question whether or not to adopt a definite new method of production that
is the best thing out and, in the form immediately available, can be expected
to retain that position for some length of time. A new type of machine is in
general but a link in a chain of improvements and may presently become
obsolete. In a case like this it would obviously not be rational to follow the
chain link by link regardless of the capital loss to be suffered each time. The
real question then is at which link the concern should take action. The
answer must be in the nature of a compromise between considerations that
rest largely on guesses. But it will as a rule involve some waiting in order
to see how the chain behaves. And to the outsider this may well look like
trying to stifle improvement in order to conserve existing capital values. Yet
even the most patient of comrades would revolt if a socialist management
were so foolish as to follow the advice of the theorist and to keep on
scrapping plant and equipment every year.
