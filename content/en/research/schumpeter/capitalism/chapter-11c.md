There is finally all that may be grouped around the symbolic centerpiece of Gladstonian liberalism. The term Individualist Democracy would do just as well—better in fact because we want to cover some things that Gladstone would not have approved and a moral and spiritual attitude which, dwelling in the citadel of faith, he actually hated. 

At that I could leave this point if radical liturgy did not consist largely in picturesque denials of what I mean to convey. Radicals may insist that the masses are crying for salvation from intolerable sufferings and rattling their chains in darkness and despair, but of course there never was so much personal freedom of mind and body for all, never so much readiness to bear with and even to finance the mortal enemies of the leading class, never so much active sympathy with real and faked sufferings, never so much readiness to accept burdens, as there is in modern capitalist society; and whatever democracy there was, outside of peasant communities, developed historically in the wake of both modern and ancient capitalism. Again plenty of facts can be adduced from the past to make up a counterargument that will be effective but is irrelevant in a discussion of present conditions and future alternatives.8 

If we do decide to embark upon historical disquisition at all, then even many of those facts which to radical critics may seem to be the most eligible ones for their purpose will often look differently if viewed in the light of a comparison with the corresponding facts of pre-capitalist experience. And it cannot be replied that “those were different times.” For it is precisely the capi talist process that made the difference.

Two points in particular must be mentioned. I have pointed out before that
social legislation or, more generally, institutional change for the benefit of the
masses is not simply something which has been forced upon capitalist society
by an ineluctable necessity to alleviate the ever-deepening misery of the poor
but that, besides raising the standard of living of the masses by virtue of its
automatic effects, the capitalist process also provided for that legislation the
means “and the will.” The words in quotes require further explanation that is
to be found in the principle of spreading rationality. 

The capitalist process
rationalizes behavior and ideas and by so doing chases from our minds, along
with metaphysical belief, mystic and romantic ideas of all sorts. Thus it
reshapes not only our methods of attaining our ends but also these ultimate
ends themselves. “Free thinking” in the sense of materialistic monism, laicism
and pragmatic acceptance of the world this side of the grave follow from this
not indeed by logical necessity but nevertheless very naturally. On the one
hand, our inherited sense of duty, deprived of its traditional basis, becomes
focused in utilitarian ideas about the betterment of mankind which, quite
illogically to be sure, seem to withstand rationalist criticism better than, say,
the fear of God does. On the other hand, the same rationalization of the soul
rubs off all the glamour of super-empirical sanction from every species of
classwise rights. This then, together with the typically capitalist enthusiasm for
Efficiency and Service—so completely different from the body of ideas which
would have been associated with those terms by the typical knight of old—
breeds that “will” within the bourgeoisie itself. Feminism, an essentially
capitalist phenomenon, illustrates the point still more clearly. The reader will
realize that these tendencies must be understood “objectively” and that
therefore no amount of anti-feminist or anti-reformist talk or even of temporary
opposition to any particular measure proves anything against this analysis.
These things are the very symptoms of the tendencies they pretend to fight.
Of this, more in the subsequent chapters.



<!-- 8 Even Marx, in whose time indictments of this kind were not anything like as absurd as
they are today, evidently thought it desirable to strengthen his case by dwelling on conditions
that even then were either past or visibly passing. -->

Also, capitalist civilization is rationalistic “and anti-heroic.” The two go
together of course. Success in industry and commerce requires a lot of
stamina, yet industrial and commercial activity is essentially unheroic in the
knight’s sense—no flourishing of swords about it, not much physical
prowess, no chance to gallop the armored horse into the enemy, preferably
a heretic or heathen—and the ideology that glorifies the idea of fighting for
fighting’s sake and of victory for victory’s sake understandably withers in
the office among all the columns of figures. Therefore, owning assets that
are apt to attract the robber or the tax gatherer and not sharing or even
disliking warrior ideology that conflicts with its “rational” utilitarianism, the
industrial and commercial bourgeoisie is fundamentally pacifist and inclined
to insist on the application of the moral precepts of private life to
international relations. It is true that, unlike most but like some other features
of capitalist civilization, pacifism and international morality have also been
espoused in non-capitalist environments and by precapitalist agencies, in the
Middle Ages by the Roman Church for instance. Modern pacifism and
modern international morality are nonetheless products of capitalism.


In view of the fact that Marxian doctrine—especially Neo-Marxian
doctrine and even a considerable body of non-socialist opinion—is, as we
have seen in the first part of this book, strongly opposed to this proposition 9
it is necessary to point out that the latter is not meant to deny that many a
bourgeoisie has put up a splendid fight for hearth and home, or that almost
purely bourgeois commonwealths were often aggressive when it seemed to
pay—like the Athenian or the Venetian commonwealths—or that no
bourgeoisie ever disliked war profits and advantages to trade accruing from
conquest or refused to be trained in warlike nationalism by its feudal masters
or leaders or by the propaganda of some specially interested group. 


Such instances of capitalist combativeness are not, as Marxism
has it, to be explained—exclusively or primarily—in terms of class interests
or class situations that systematically engender capitalist wars of conquest;
second, that there is a difference between doing that which you consider your
normal business in life, for which you prepare yourself in season and out of
season and in terms of which you define your success or failure, and doing
what is not in your line, for which your normal work and your mentality do
not fit you and success in which will increase the prestige of the most
unbourgeois of professions; and third, that this difference steadily tells—in
international as well as in domestic affairs—against the use of military force
and for peaceful arrangements, even where the balance of pecuniary
advantage is clearly on the side of war which, under modern circumstances,
is not in general very likely. As a matter of fact, the more completely
capitalist the structure and attitude of a nation, the more pacifist—and the
more prone to count the costs of war—we observe it to be. 

<!-- 9 See our discussion of the Marxian theory of imperialism, Part I, ch. iv. -->

Owing to the complex nature of every individual pattern, this could be fully brought out
only by detailed historical analysis. But the bourgeois attitude to the military
(standing armies), the spirit in which and the methods by which bourgeois
societies wage war, and the readiness with which, in any serious case of
prolonged warfare, they submit to non-bourgeois rule are conclusive in
themselves. The Marxist theory that imperialism is the last stage of capitalist
evolution therefore fails quite irrespective of purely economic objections.
But I am not going to sum up as the reader presumably expects me to.
That is to say, I am not going to invite him, before he decides to put his
trust in an untried alternative advocated by untried men, to look once more
at the impressive economic and the still more impressive cultural
achievement of the capitalist order and at the immense promise held out
by both. I am not going to argue that that achievement and that promise
are in themselves sufficient to support an argument for allowing the
capitalist process to work on and, as it might easily be put, to lift poverty
from the shoulders of mankind.

There would be no sense in this. Even if mankind were as free to choose
as a businessman is free to choose between two competing pieces of
machinery, no determined value judgment necessarily follows from the facts
and relations between facts that I have tried to convey. As regards the
economic performance, it does not follow that men are “happier” or even
“better off” in the industrial society of today than they were in a medieval
manor or village. As regards the cultural performance, one may accept every
word I have written and yet hate it—its utilitarianism and the wholesale
destruction of Meanings incident to it—from the bottom of one’s heart.
Moreover, as I shall have to emphasize again in our discussion of the
socialist alternative, one may care less for the efficiency of the capitalist
process in producing economic and cultural values than for the kind of
human beings that it turns out and then leaves to their own devices, free to
make a mess of their lives. There is a type of radical whose adverse verdict
about capitalist civilization rests on nothing except stupidity, ignorance or
irresponsibility, who is unable or unwilling to grasp the most obvious facts,
let alone their wider implications. But a completely adverse verdict may also
be arrived at on a higher plane.

However, whether favorable or unfavorable, value judgments about
capitalist performance are of little interest. For mankind is not free to choose.
This is not only because the mass of people are not in a position to compare
alternatives rationally and always accept what they are being told. There is
a much deeper reason for it. Things economic and social move by their own
momentum and the ensuing situations compel individuals and groups to
behave in certain ways whatever they may wish to do—not indeed by destroying their freedom of choice but by shaping the choosing mentalities and by narrowing the list of possibilities from which to choose. If this is the
quintessence of Marxism then we all of us have got to be Marxists. In
consequence, capitalist performance is not even relevant for prognosis. Most
civilizations have disappeared before they had time to fill to the full the
measure of their promise. Hence I am not going to argue, on the strength of
that performance, that the capitalist intermezzo is likely to be prolonged. In
fact, I am now going to draw the exactly opposite inference.
