So far we have been considering the effects of the capitalist process upon
the economic bases of the upper strata of capitalist society and upon their social position and prestige. 

But effects further extend to the institutional framework that protected them. In showing this we shall take the term in its widest acceptance so as to include not only legal institutions but also attitudes of the public mind and policies.

1. Capitalist evolution first of all destroyed, or went far toward destroying, the institutional arrangements of the feudal world—the manor, the village, the craft guild. 

The facts and mechanisms of this process are too familiar to detain us. Destruction was wrought in three ways. The world of the artisan was destroyed primarily by the automatic effects of the competition that came from the capitalist entrepreneur; political action in removing atrophic organizations and regulations only registered results. The world of the lord and the peasant was destroyed primarily by political—in some cases revolutionary—action and capitalism merely presided over adaptive transformations say, of the German manorial organizations into large-scale agricul tural units of production. But along with these industrial and agrarian revolutions went a no less revolutionary change in the general attitude of legislative authority and public opinion. Together with the old economic organization vanished the economic and political privileges of the classes or groups that used to play the leading role in it, particularly the tax exemptions and the political prerogatives of the landed nobility and gentry and of the clergy.

Economically all this meant for the bourgeoisie the breaking of so many
fetters and the removal of so many barriers. Politically it meant the
replacement of an order in which the bourgeois was a humble subject by
another that was more congenial to his rationalist mind and to his immediate
interests. But, surveying that process from the standpoint of today, the
observer might well wonder whether in the end such complete emancipation
was good for the bourgeois and his world. For those fetters not only
hampered, they also sheltered. Before proceeding further we must carefully
clarify and appraise this point.

2. The related processes of the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie and of the rise of national states produced, in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a social structure that may seem to us amphibial though it was no more amphibial or transitional than any other. Consider the outstanding instance that is afforded by the monarchy of Louis XIV. The royal power had subjugated the landed aristocracy and at the same time conciliated it by proffering employment and pensions and by conditionally accepting its claim to a ruling or leading class position. The same royal power had subjugated and allied itself with the clergy. 2 It had finally strengthened its sway over the bourgeoisie, its old ally in the struggle with the territorial magnates, protecting and propelling its enterprise in order to exploit it the more effectively in turn. Peasants and the (small) industrial proletariat were likewise managed, exploited and protected by public authority—though the protection was in the case of the French ancien régime very much less in evidence than for instance in the Austria of Maria Theresa or of Joseph II—and, vicariously, by landlords or industrialists. This was not simply a government in the sense of nineteenth-century liberalism, i.e., a social agency existing for the performance of a few limited functions to be financed by a minimum of revenue. On principle, the monarchy managed everything, from consciences to the patterns of the silk fabrics of Lyons, and financially it aimed at a maximum of revenue. Though the king was never really absolute, public authority was all-comprehensive.

Correct diagnosis of this pattern is of the utmost importance for our subject.
The king, the court, the army, the church and the bureaucracy lived to an
increasing extent on revenue created by the capitalist process, even purely
feudal sources of income being swelled in consequence of contemporaneous
capitalist developments. To an increasing extent also, domestic and foreign
policies and institutional changes were shaped to suit and propel that
development. As far as that goes, the feudal elements in the structure of the
so-called absolute monarchy come in only under the heading of atavisms
which in fact is the diagnosis one would naturally adopt at first sight.
Looking more closely, however, we realize that those elements meant
more than that. The steel frame of that structure still consisted of the human
material of feudal society and this material still behaved according to
precapitalist patterns. It filled the offices of state, officered the army, devised
policies—it functioned as a classe dirigente and, though taking account of
bourgeois interests, it took care to distance itself from the bourgeoisie. The
centerpiece, the king, was king by the grace of God, and the root of his
position was feudal, not only in the historical but also in the sociological
sense, however much he availed himself of the economic possibilities offered
by capitalism. All this was more than atavism. It was an active symbiosis of
two social strata, one of which no doubt supported the other economically
but was in turn supported by the other politically. Whatever we may think
of the achievements or shortcomings of this arrangement, whatever the
bourgeois himself may have thought of it at the time or later—and of the
aristocratic scapegrace or idler—it was of the essence of that society.

3. Of that society only? 

The subsequent course of things, best exemplified by the English case, suggests the answer. The aristocratic element continued to rule the roost right to the end of the period of intact and vital capitalism. No doubt that element—though nowhere so effectively as in England— currently absorbed the brains from other strata that drifted into politics; it made itself the representative of bourgeois interests and fought the battles of the bourgeoisie; it had to surrender its last legal privileges; but with these qualifications, and for ends no longer its own, it continued to man the political engine, to manage the state, to govern.

The economically operative part of the bourgeois strata did not offer much opposition to this. On the whole, that kind of division of labor suited them and they liked it. Where they did revolt against it or where they got into the political saddle without having to revolt, they did not make a conspicuous success of ruling and did not prove able to hold their own. The question arises whether it is really safe to assume that these failures were merely due to lack of opportunity to acquire experience and, with experience, the attitudes of a politically ruling class.

It is not. There is a more fundamental reason for those failures such as
are instanced by the French or German experiences with bourgeois attempts
at ruling—a reason which again will best be visualized by contrasting the
figure of the industrialist or merchant with that of the medieval lord. The
latter’s “profession” not only qualified him admirably for the defense of his
own class interest—he was not only able to fight for it physically—but it also
cast a halo around him and made of him a ruler of men. The first was
important, but more so were the mystic glamour and the lordly attitude—
that ability and habit to command and to be obeyed that carried prestige with
all classes of society and in every walk of life. That prestige was so great
and that attitude so useful that the class position outlived the social and
technological conditions which had given rise to it and proved adaptable, by
means of a transformation of the class function, to quite different social and
economic conditions. With the utmost ease and grace the lords and knights
metamorphosed themselves into courtiers, administrators, diplomats,
politicians and into military officers of a type that had nothing whatever to
do with that of the medieval knight. And—most astonishing phenomenon
when we come to think of it—a remnant of that old prestige survives even
to this day, and not only with our ladies.

Of the industrialist and merchant the opposite is true. There is surely no trace
of any mystic glamour about him which is what counts in the ruling of men.
The stock exchange is a poor substitute for the Holy Grail. We have seen that
the industrialist and merchant, as far as they are entrepreneurs, also fill a function
of leadership. But economic leadership of this type does not readily expand, like
the medieval lord’s military leadership, into the leadership of nations. On the
contrary, the ledger and the cost calculation absorb and confine.
I have called the bourgeois rationalist and unheroic. He can only use
rationalist and unheroic means to defend his position or to bend a nation to
his will. He can impress by what people may expect from his economic performance, he can argue his case, he can promise to pay out money or
threaten to withhold it, he can hire the treacherous services of a condottiere
or politician or journalist. But that is all and all of it is greatly overrated as
to its political value. Nor are his experiences and habits of life of the kind
that develop personal fascination. A genius in the business office may be,
and often is, utterly unable outside of it to say boo to a goose—both in the
drawing room and on the platform. Knowing this he wants to be left alone
and to leave politics alone.

Again exceptions will occur to the reader. But again they do not amount
to much. Aptitude for, and interest and success in, city management is the
only important exception in Europe, and this will be found to strengthen our
case instead of weakening it. Before the advent of the modern metropolis,
which is no longer a bourgeois affair, city management was akin to business
management. Grasp of its problems and authority within its precincts came
naturally to the manufacturer and trader, and the local interests of
manufacturing and trading supplied most of the subject matter of its politics
which therefore lent itself to treatment by the methods and in the spirit of
the business office. Under exceptionally favorable conditions, exceptional
developments sprouted from those roots, such as the developments of the
Venetian or Genoese republics. The case of the Low Countries enters into
the same pattern, but it is particularly instructive by virtue of the fact that
the merchants’ republic invariably failed in the great game of international
politics and that in practically every emergency it had to hand over the reins
to a warlord of feudal complexion. As regards the United States, it would
be easy to list the uniquely favorable circumstances—rapidly waning—that
explain its case. 3

<!-- 4. The inference is obvious: barring such exceptional conditions, the
bourgeois class is ill equipped to face the problems, both domestic and
international, that have normally to be faced by a country of any importance.
The bourgeois themselves feel this in spite of all the phraseology that seems
to deny it, and so do the masses. Within a protecting framework not made
of bourgeois material, the bourgeoisie may be successful, not only in the
political defensive but also in the offensive, especially as an opposition. For
a time it felt so safe as to be able to afford the luxury of attacking the
protective frame itself; such bourgeois opposition as there was in imperial
Germany illustrates this to perfection. But without protection by some non-
bourgeois group, the bourgeoisie is politically helpless and unable not only
to lead its nation but even to take care of its particular class interest. Which
amounts to saying that it needs a master. -->

<!-- 3 This line of reasoning will he taken up again in Part IV. -->

But the capitalist process, both by its economic mechanics and by its psycho-sociological effects, did away with this protecting master or, as in this country, never gave him, or a substitute for him, a chance to develop. The implications of this are strengthened by another consequence of the same process. Capitalist evolution eliminates not only the king Dei Gratia but also the political entrenchments that, had they proved tenable, would have been formed by the village and the craft guild. Of course, neither organization was tenable in the precise shape in which capitalism found it. But capitalist policies wrought destruction much beyond what was unavoidable. They attacked the artisan in reservations in which he could have survived for an indefinite time. They forced upon the peasant all the blessings of early liberalism—the free and unsheltered holding and all the individualist rope he needed in order to hang himself.

In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. Having discovered this fact which so many slogans obscure, we might well wonder whether it is quite correct to look upon capitalism as a social form sui generis or, in fact, as anything else but the last stage of the decomposition of what we have called feudalism. On the whole, I am inclined to believe that its peculiarities suffice to make a type and to accept that symbiosis of classes which owe their existence to different epochs and processes as the rule rather than as an exception—at least it has been the rule these 6000 years, i.e., ever since primitive tillers of the soil became the subjects of mounted nomads. But there is no great objection that I can see against the opposite view alluded to.
