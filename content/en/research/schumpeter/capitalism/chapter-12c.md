We return from our digression with a load of ominous facts. They are almost,
though not quite, sufficient to establish our next point, viz., that the capitalist
process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional
framework of feudal society also undermines its own.

It has been pointed out above that the very success of capitalist enterprise
paradoxically tends to impair the prestige or social weight of the class
primarily associated with it and that the giant unit of control tends to oust
the bourgeoisie from the function to which it owed that social weight. The
corresponding change in the meaning, and the incidental loss in vitality, of the institutions of the bourgeois world and of its typical attitudes are easy
to trace.

On the one hand, the capitalist process unavoidably attacks the economic
standing ground of the small producer and trader. What it did to the pre-
capitalist strata it also does—and by the same competitive mechanism—to
the lower strata of capitalist industry. Here of course Marx scores. It is true
that the facts of industrial concentration do not quite live up to the ideas the
public is being taught to entertain about it (see Chapter XIX). The process
has gone less far and is less free from setbacks and compensatory tendencies
than one would gather from many a popular exposition. In particular,
largescale enterprise not only annihilates but also, to some extent, creates
space for the small producing, and especially trading, firm. Also, in the case
of the peasants and farmers, the capitalist world has at last proved both
willing and able to pursue an expensive but on the whole effective policy of
conservation. 

In the long run, however, there can. be little doubt about the
fact we are envisaging, or about its consequences. Outside of the agrarian
field, moreover, the bourgeoisie has shown but little awareness of the
problem4 or its importance for the survival of the capitalist order. The profits
to be made by rationalizing the organization of production and especially by
cheapening the tortuous way of commodities from the factory to the ultimate
consumer are more than the mind of the typical businessman can resist.
Now it is important to realize precisely what these consequences consist
in. 

A very common type of social criticism which we have already met
laments the “decline of competition” and equates it to the decline of
capitalism because of the virtues it attributes to competition and the vices it
attributes to modern industrial “monopolies.” In this schema of
interpretation, monopolization plays the role of arteriosclerosis and reacts
upon the fortunes of the capitalist order through increasingly unsatisfactory
economic performance. We have seen the reasons for rejecting this view.
Economically neither the case for competition nor the case against
concentration of economic control is anything like as strong as this argument
implies. And, whether weak or strong, it misses the salient point. Even if the
giant concerns were all managed so perfectly as to call forth applause from
the angels in heaven, the political consequences of concentration would still
be what they are. The political structure of a nation is profoundly affected
by the elimination of a host of small and mediumsized firms the owner-
managers of which, together with their dependents, henchmen and
connections, count quantitatively at the polls and have a hold on what we

may term the foreman class that no management of a large unit can ever
have; the very foundation of private property and free contracting wears
away in a nation in which its most vital, most concrete, most meaningful
types disappear from the moral horizon of the people.

On the other hand, the capitalist process also attacks its own institutional
framework—let us continue to visualize “property” and “free contracting” as
partes pro toto—within the precincts of the big units. Excepting the cases that
are still of considerable importance in which a corporation is practically owned
by a single individual or family, the figure of the proprietor and with it the
specifically proprietary interest have vanished from the picture. There are the
salaried executives and all the salaried managers and submanagers. There are
the big stockholders. And then there are the small stockholders. The first group
tends to acquire the employee attitude and rarely if ever identifies itself with
the stockholding interest even in the most favorable cases, i.e., in the cases in
which it identifies itself with the interest of the concern as such. The second
group, even if it considers its connection with the concern as permanent and
even if it actually behaves as financial theory would have stockholders behave,
is at one remove from both the functions and the attitudes of an owner. As to
the third group, small stockholders often do not care much about what for most
of them is but a minor source of income and, whether they care or not, they
hardly ever bother, unless they or some representatives of theirs are out to
exploit their nuisance value; being often very ill used and still more often
thinking themselves ill used, they almost regularly drift into an attitude hostile
to “their” corporations, to big business in general and, particularly when things
look bad, to the capitalist order as such. No element of any of those three
groups into which I schematized the typical situation unconditionally takes the
attitude characteristic of that curious phenomenon, so full of meaning and so
rapidly passing, that is covered by the term Property.

Freedom of contracting is in the same boat. In its full vitality it meant
individual contracting regulated by individual choice between an indefinite
number of possibilities. The stereotyped, unindividual, impersonal and
bureaucratized contract of today—this applies much more generally, but a
potiori we may fasten upon the labor contract—which presents but restricted
freedom of choice and mostly turns on a c’est à prendre ou à laisser, has none
of the old features the most important of which become impossible with giant
concerns dealing with other giant concerns or impersonal masses of workmen
or consumers. The void is being filled by a tropical growth of new legal
structures—and a little reflection shows that this could hardly be otherwise.

Thus the capitalist process pushes into the background all those
institutions, the institutions of property and free contracting in particular, that
expressed the needs and ways of the truly “private” economic activity. Where it does not abolish them, as it already has abolished free contracting in the labor market, it attains the same end by shifting the relative importance of
existing legal forms—the legal forms pertaining to corporate business for
instance as against those pertaining to the partnership or individual firm—
or by changing their contents or meanings. 

The capitalist process, by
substituting a mere parcel of shares for the walls of and the machines in a
factory, takes the life out of the idea of property. It loosens the grip that once
was so strong—the grip in the sense of the legal right and the actual ability
to do as one pleases with one’s own; the grip also in the sense that the holder
of the title loses the will to fight, economically, physically, politically, for
“his” factory and his control over it, to die if necessary on its steps. And this
evaporation of what we may term the material substance of property—its
visible and touchable reality—affects not only the attitude of holders but also
that of the workmen and of the public in general. Dematerialized,
defunctionalized and absentee ownership does not impress and call forth
moral allegiance as the vital form of property did. Eventually there will be
nobody left who really cares to stand for it—nobody within and nobody
without the precincts of the big concerns.
