## I. The Social Atmosphere Of Capitalism

The capitalist process produced that atmosphere of almost universal hostility to its own social order.

<!-- The phenomenon is so striking and both the Marxian and the popular explanations are so inadequate that it is desirable
to develop the theory of it a little further. -->

1. The capitalist process:
- eventually decreases the importance of the function by which the capitalist class lives. 
- tends to break down its own defenses
  <!-- - wear away protective strata  -->
  <!-- - disperse the garrisons of its entrenchments.  -->

Capitalism creates a critical frame of mind which, after having destroyed the moral authority of so many other institutions, in the end turns against its own.

The bourgeois finds to his amazement that the rationalist attitude does not stop at the credentials of kings and popes but goes on to attack private property and the whole scheme of bourgeois values.

The bourgeois fortress thus becomes politically defenseless. 

Defenseless fortresses invite aggression especially if there is rich booty in them. Aggressors will work themselves up into a state of rationalizing hostility 1 —aggressors always do.

It is possible, for a time, to buy them off. 

But this last resource fails as soon as they discover that they can have all. In part, this
explains what we are out to explain. So far as it goes—it does not go the whole
way of course—this element of our theory is verified by the high correlation
that exists historically between bourgeois defenselessness and hostility to the
capitalist order: there was very little hostility on principle as long as the
bourgeois position was safe, although there was then much more reason for
it; it spread pari passu with the crumbling of the protecting walls.


2. An industrialist who honestly feels he is doing his duty by all classes of society—why should the capitalist order need any
protection by extra-capitalist powers or extra-rational loyalties? 

<!-- 1 It is hoped that no confusion will arise from my using the verb “to rationalize” in two
different meanings. An industrial plant is being “rationalized” when its productive efficiency
per unit of expenditure is being increased. We “rationalize” an action of ours when we supply
ourselves and others with reasons for it that satisfy our standard of values regardless of what
our true impulses may be. -->

Can it not
come out of the trial with flying colors? Does not our own previous
argument sufficiently show that it has plenty of utilitarian credentials to
present? Cannot a perfectly good case be made out for it? And those
industrialists will assuredly not fail to point out that a sensible workman,
in weighing the pro’s and con’s of his contract with, say, one of the big
steel or automobile concerns, might well come to the conclusion that,
everything considered, he is not doing so badly and that the advantages
of this bargain are not all on one side. Yes—certainly, only all that is
quite irrelevant.

For, first, it is an error to believe that political attack arises primarily from
grievance and that it can be turned by justification. Political criticism cannot
be met effectively by rational argument. From the fact that the criticism of the
capitalist order proceeds from a critical attitude of mind, i.e., from an attitude
which spurns allegiance to extra-rational values, it does not follow that rational
refutation will be accepted. Such refutation may tear the rational gart of attack
but can never reach the extra-rational driving power that always lurks behind
it. Capitalist rationality does not do away with sub- or super-rational impulses.

It merely makes them get out of hand by removing the restraint of sacred or
semi-sacred tradition. In a civilization that lacks the means and even the will
to discipline and to guide them, they will revolt. And once they revolt it matters
little that, in a rationalist culture, their manifestations will in general be
rationalized somehow. Just as the call for utilitarian credentials has never been
addressed to kings, lords and popes in a judicial frame of mind that would
accept the possibility of a satisfactory answer, so capitalism stands its trial
before judges who have the sentence of death in their pockets. 

They are going
to pass it, whatever the defense they may hear; the only success victorious
defense can possibly produce is a change in the indictment. Utilitarian reason
is in any case weak as a prime mover of group action. In no case is it a match
for the extra-rational determinants of conduct.

Second, the success of the indictment becomes quite understandable as soon
as we realize what acceptance of the case for capitalism would imply. That
case, were it even much stronger than it actually is, could never be made
simple. People at large would have to be possessed of an insight and a power
of analysis which are altogether beyond them. Why, practically every nonsense
that has ever been said about capitalism has been championed by some
professed economist. But even if this is disregarded, rational recognition of the
economic performance of capitalism and of the hopes it holds out for the future
would require an almost impossible moral feat by the have-not. 

That
performance stands out only if we take a long-run view; any pro-capitalist argument must rest on long-run considerations. In the short run, it is profits
and inefficiencies that dominate the picture. In order to accept his lot, the
leveler or the chartist of old would have had to comfort himself with hopes
for his great-grandchildren. In order to identify himself with the capitalist
system, the unemployed of today would have completely to forget his personal
fate and the politician of today his personal ambition. 

The long-run interests
of society are so entirely lodged with the upper strata of bourgeois society that
it is perfectly natural for people to look upon them as the interests of that class
only. 

For the masses, it is the short-run view that counts. Like Louis XV, they
feel après nous le déluge, and from the standpoint of individualist
utilitarianism they are of course being perfectly rational if they feel like that.
Third, there are the daily troubles and expectations of trouble everyone has
to struggle with in any social system—the frictions and disappointments, the
greater and smaller unpleasant events that hurt, annoy and thwart. I suppose
that every one of us is more or less in the habit of attributing them wholly to
that part of reality which lies without his skin, and emotional attachment to
the social order—i.e., the very thing capitalism is constitutionally unable to
produce—is necessary in order to overcome the hostile impulse by which we
react to them. If there is no emotional attachment, then that impulse has its
way and grows into a permanent constituent of our psychic setup.
Fourth, the ever-rising standards of life and particularly the leisure that
modern capitalism provides for the fully employed workman…well, there is
no need for me to finish the sentence or to elaborate one of the truest, oldest
and most stodgy of all arguments which unfortunately is but too true. Secular
improvement that is taken for granted and coupled with individual insecurity
that is acutely resented is of course the best recipe for breeding social unrest.
