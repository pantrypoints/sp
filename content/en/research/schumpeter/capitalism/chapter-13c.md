There is, however, another factor. One of the most important features of the later stages of capitalist civilization is the vigorous expansion of the educational apparatus and particularly of the facilities for higher education. 

This development was and is no less inevitable than the development of the largest-scale industrial unit, 9 but, unlike the latter, it has been and is being fostered by public opinion and public authority so as to go much further than it would have done under its own steam. Whatever we may think of this from other standpoints and whatever the precise causation, there are several consequences that bear upon the size and attitude of the intellectual group.

1. Higher education thus increases the supply of services
in professional, quasi-professional and in the end all “whitecollar” lines
beyond the point determined by cost-return considerations, it may create a
particularly important case of sectional unemployment.

2. In place of such unemployment, it creates
unsatisfactory conditions of employment—employment in substandard work
or at wages below those of the better-paid manual workers.

3. It may create unemployability of a particularly disconcerting
type. The man who has gone through a college or university easily
becomes psychically unemployable in manual occupations without
necessarily acquiring employability in, say, professional work. His
failure to do so may be due either to lack of natural ability—perfectly
compatible with passing academic tests—or to inadequate teaching; and
both cases will, absolutely and relatively, occur more frequently as ever
larger numbers are drafted into higher education and as the required
amount of teaching increases irrespective of how many teachers and
scholars nature chooses to turn out. The results of neglecting this and
of acting on the theory that schools, colleges and universities are just
a matter of money, are too obvious to insist upon. Cases in which
among a dozen applicants for a job, all formally qualified, there is not
one who can fill it satisfactorily, are known to everyone who has
anything to do with appointments—to everyone, that is, who is himself
qualified to judge.

<!-- 9 At present this development is viewed by most people from the standpoint of the ideal of
making educational facilities of any type available to all who can be induced to use them. This
ideal is so strongly held that any doubts about it are almost universally considered to be nothing
short of indecent, a situation not improved by the comments, all too often flippant, of
dissentients. Actually, we brush here against a set of extremely complex problems of the
sociology of education and educational ideals which we cannot attack within the limits of this
sketch. This is why I have confined the above paragraph to two incontestable and noncommittal
trivialities that are all we want for the purpose in hand. But of course they do not dispose of
the larger problems which must be left aside to testify to the incompleteness of my exposition. -->

All those who are unemployed or unsatisfactorily employed or
unemployable drift into the vocations in which standards are least definite
or in which aptitudes and acquirements of a different order count. They swell
the host of intellectuals in the strict sense of the term whose numbers hence
increase disproportionately. They enter it in a thoroughly discontented frame
of mind. Discontent breeds resentment. And it often rationalizes itself into
that social criticism which as we have seen before is in any case the
intellectual spectator’s typical attitude toward men, classes and institutions
especially in a rationalist and utilitarian civilization.

Here we have
numbers; a well-defined group situation of proletarian hue; and a group
interest shaping a group attitude that will much more realistically account
for hostility to the capitalist order than could the theory—itself a
rationalization in the psychological sense—according to which the
intellectual’s righteous indignation about the wrongs of capitalism simply
represents the logical inference from outrageous facts and which is no better
than the theory of lovers that their feelings represent nothing but the logical
inference from the virtues of the beloved. 10 Moreover our theory also
accounts for the fact that this hostility increases, instead of diminishing, with
every achievement of capitalist evolution.

Of course, the hostility of the intellectual group—amounting to moral
disapproval of the capitalist order—is one thing, and the general hostile
atmosphere which surrounds the capitalist engine is another thing. The latter
is the really significant phenomenon; and it is not simply the product of the
former but flows partly from independent sources, some of which have been
mentioned before; so far as it does, it is raw material for the intellectual
group to work on. There are give-and-take relations between the two which
it would require more space to unravel than I can spare. The general contours
of such an analysis are however sufficiently obvious and I think it safe to
repeat that the role of the intellectual group consists primarily in stimulating,
energizing, verbalizing and organizing this material and only secondarily in
adding to it. Some particular aspects will illustrate the principle.

<!-- 10 The reader will observe that any such theories would be unrealistic even if the facts of
capitalism or the virtues of the beloved were actually all that the social critic or the lover
believes them to be. It is also important to note that in the overwhelming majority of cases
both critics and lovers are obviously sincere; neither psycho-sociological nor psycho-physical
mechanisms enter as a rule into the limelight of the Ego, except in the mask of sublimations. -->

6. Capitalist evolution produces a labor movement which obviously is
not the creation of the intellectual group. But it is not surprising that such
an opportunity and the intellectual demiurge should find each other.
Labor never craved intellectual leadership but intellectuals invaded labor
politics. 

They had an important contribution to make: they verbalized the movement, supplied theories and slogans for it—class war is an excellent
example—made it conscious of itself and in doing so changed its
meaning. In solving this task from their own standpoint, they naturally
radicalized it, eventually imparting a revolutionary bias to the most
bourgeois trade-union practices, a bias most of the non-intellectual
leaders at first greatly resented. But there was another reason for this.
Listening to the intellectual, the workman is almost invariably conscious
of an impassable gulf if not of downright distrust. In order to get hold
of him and to compete with non-intellectual leaders, the intellectual is
driven to courses entirely unnecessary for the latter who can afford to
frown. Having no genuine authority and feeling always in danger of
being unceremoniously told to mind his own business, he must flatter,
promise and incite, nurse left wings and scowling minorities, sponsor
doubtful or submarginal cases, appeal to fringe ends, profess himself
ready to obey—in short, behave toward the masses as his predecessors
behaved first toward their ecclesiastical superiors, later toward princes
and other individual patrons, still later toward the collective master of
bourgeois complexion. 11 Thus, though intellectuals have not created the
labor movement, they have yet worked it up into something that differs
substantially from what it would be without them.

The social atmosphere, for the theory of which we have been gathering
stones and mortar, explains why public policy grows more and more hostile
to capitalist interests, eventually so much so as to refuse on principle to take
account of the requirements of the capitalist engine and to become a serious
impediment to its functioning. The intellectual group’s activities have
however a relation to anti-capitalist policies that is more direct than what is
implied in their share in verbalizing them. Intellectuals rarely enter
professional politics and still more rarely conquer responsible office. But
they staff political bureaus, write party pamphlets and speeches, act as
secretaries and advisers, make the individual politician’s newspaper
reputation which, though it is not everything, few men can afford to neglect.
In doing these things they to some extent impress their mentality on almost
everything that is being done.

<!-- 11 All this will be illustrated and further developed in Part V. -->

The actual influence exerted varies greatly with the state of the political
game from mere formulation to making a measure politically possible or
impossible. But there is always plenty of scope for it. When we say that
individual politicians and parties are exponents of class interests we are at
best emphasizing one-half of the truth. The other half, just as important if
not more so, comes into view when we consider that politics is a profession which evolves interests of its own—interests that may clash with as well
as conform to the interests of the groups that a man or party “represents.” 12


Individual and party opinion is, more than anything else, sensitive to those
factors in the political situation that directly affect the career or the
standing of the individual or party. Some of these are controlled by the
intellectual group in much the same sense as is the moral code of an epoch
that exalts the cause of some interests and puts the cause of others tacitly
out of court.

Finally, that social atmosphere or code of values affects not only
policies—the spirit of legislation—but also administrative practice. But again
there is also a more direct relation between the intellectual group and
bureaucracy. The bureaucracies of Europe are of pre- and extra-capitalist
origin. However much they may have changed in composition as the
centuries rolled on, they never identified themselves wholly with the
bourgeoisie, its interests or its scheme of values, and never saw much more
in it than an asset to be managed in the interest of the monarch or of the
nation. Except for inhibitions due to professional training and experience,
they are therefore open to conversion by the modern intellectual with whom,
through a similar education, they have much in common, 13 while the tinge
of gentility that in many cases used to raise a barrier has been fading away
from the modern civil servant during the last decades. 

Moreover, in times
of rapid expansion of the sphere of public administration, much of the
additional personnel required has to be taken directly from the intellectual
group—witness this country.

<!-- 12 This of course is just as true of the intellectuals themselves with respect to the class from
which they come or to which, economically and culturally, they belong. The subject will be
taken up again in ch. xxiii.

3. In a sense, therefore, the Aretino’s pen was indeed stronger than the
sword. But, perhaps through ignorance, I do not know of comparable
instances of that type for the next hundred and fifty years, 6 during which
intellectuals do not seem to have played any great role outside and
independently of the established professions, mainly the law and the church.

This setback roughly coincides with the setback in capitalist evolution
which in most countries of continental Europe occurred in that troubled
period. And the subsequent recovery of capitalist enterprise was similarly
shared by the intellectuals. The cheaper book, the cheap newspaper or
pamphlet, together with the widening of the public that was in part their

seventeenth century. -->

product but partly an independent phenomenon due to the access of wealth
and weight which came to the industrial bourgeoisie and to the incident
increase in the political importance of an anonymous public opinion—all
these boons, as well as increasing freedom from restraint, are by-products
of the capitalist engine.

In the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century the individual
patron was slow to lose the paramount importance in the intellectual’s
career that he had held at the beginning. But in the peak successes at
least, we clearly discern the growing importance of the new element—
the support of the collective patron, the bourgeois public. In this as in
every other respect, Voltaire affords an invaluable instance. His very
superficiality that made it possible for him to cover everything from
religion to Newtonian optics, allied to indomitable vitality and an
insatiable curiosity, a perfect absence of inhibitions, an unerring instinct
for and a wholesale acceptance of the humors of his time, enabled that
uncritical critic and mediocre poet and historian to fascinate—and to sell.
He also speculated, cheated, accepted gifts and appointments, but there
was always the independence founded on the solid base of his success
with the public. Rousseau’s case and type, though entirely different,
would be still more instructive to discuss.

In the last decades of the eighteenth century a striking episode displayed
the nature of the power of a free-lance intellectual who has nothing to work
with but the socio-psychological mechanism called Public Opinion. This
happened in England, the country that was then farthest advanced on the
road of capitalist evolution. John Wilkes’ attacks on the political system of
England, it is true, were launched under uniquely favorable circumstances;
moreover, it cannot be said that he actually upset the Earl of Bute’s
government which never had any chance and was bound to fall for a dozen
other reasons; but Wilkes’ North Briton was nevertheless the last straw that
broke…Lord Bute’s political back. No. 45 of the North Briton was the first
discharge in a campaign that secured the abolition of general warrants and
made a great stride toward the freedom of the press and of elections. This
does not amount to making history or to creating the conditions for a change
in social institutions, but it does amount to playing, say, the role of a
midwife’s assistant. 7 The inability of Wilkes’ enemies to thwart him is the
most significant fact about it all. They evidently had all the power of
organized government at their command. Yet something drove them back.
In France, the years preceding the revolution and the revolution itself
brought the rabble-raising tabloid (Marat, Desmoulins), which however did
not, like ours, completely jettison style and grammar. But we must hurry on.
The Terror and, more systematically, the First Empire put an end to this. Then
followed a period, interrupted by the rule of the roi bourgeois, of more or less
resolute repression that lasted until the Second Empire felt compelled to loosen
the reins—about the middle sixties. In central and southern Europe this period
also lasted about as long, and in England analogous conditions prevailed from the beginning of the revolutionary wars to Canning’s accession to power.


<!-- 7 I do not fear that any historian of politics will find that I have exaggerated the importance
of Wilkes’ success. But I do fear objection to my calling him a free lance and to the implication
that he owed everything to the collective, and nothing to any individual patron. In his beginnings
he was no doubt encouraged by a coterie. On examination it will however be conceded, I think,
that this was not of decisive importance and that all the support and all the money and honors
he got afterwards were but a consequence of and tribute to previous success and to a position
independently acquired with the public. -->


4. How impossible it is to stem the tide within the framework of
capitalist society is shown by the failure of the attempts—some of them
prolonged and determined—made during that period by practically all
European governments to bring the intellectuals to heel Their histories
were nothing but so many different versions of Wilkes exploits. In
capitalist society—or in a society that contains a capitalist element of
decisive importance—any attack on the intellectuals must run up against
the private fortresses of bourgeois business which, or some of which, will
shelter the quarry. Moreover such an attack must proceed according to
bourgeois principles of legislative and administrative practice which no
doubt may be stretched and bent but will checkmate prosecution beyond
a certain point. Lawless violence the bourgeois stratum may accept or
even applaud when thoroughly roused or frightened, but only temporarily.
In a purely bourgeois regime like that of Louis Philippe, troops may fire
on strikers, but the police cannot round up intellectuals or must release
them forthwith; otherwise the bourgeois stratum, however strongly
disapproving some of their. doings, will rally behind them because the
freedom it disapproves cannot be crushed without also crushing the
freedom it approves.

Observe that I am not crediting the bourgeoisie with an unrealistic dose
of generosity or idealism. Nor am I unduly stressing what people think and
feel and want—on the importance of which I almost, though not quite, agree
with Marx. In defending the intellectuals as a group—not of course every
individual—the bourgeoisie defends itself and its scheme of life. Only a
government of non-bourgeois nature and non-bourgeois creed—under
modern circumstances only a socialist or fascist one—is strong enough to
discipline them. In order to do that it would have to change typically
bourgeois institutions and drastically reduce the individual freedom of all
strata of the nation. And such a government is not likely—it would not even
be able—to stop short of private enterprise.
Growing Hostility 151
From this follows both the unwillingness and the inability of the
capitalist order to control its intellectual sector effectively. The
unwillingness in question is unwillingness to use methods consistently
that are uncongenial to the mentality shaped by the capitalist process; the
inability is the inability to do so within the frame of institutions shaped
by the capitalist process and without submitting to non-bourgeois rule.
Thus, on the one hand, freedom of public discussion involving freedom
to nibble at the foundations of capitalist society is inevitable in the long
run. On the other hand, the intellectual group cannot help nibbling,
because it lives on criticism and its whole position depends on criticism
that stings; and criticism of persons and of current events will, in a
situation in which nothing is sacrosanct, fatally issue in criticism of
classes and institutions.
