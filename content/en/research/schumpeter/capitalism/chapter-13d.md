5. The modern picture has:
- increasing means
- increase in the standard of life and in the leisure of the masses that changed and is still changing the composition
of the collective patron for the tastes of whom the intellectuals have to
provide. 

There was and is the further cheapening of the book and
newspaper and the large-scale newspaper concern. 8 There is now the
radio. And there was and is the tendency toward complete removal of
restraints, steadily breaking down those short-run attempts at resistance
by which bourgeois society proves itself so incompetent and occasionally
so childish a disciplinarian.

<!-- 8 The emergence and the career up to date of the large-scale newspaper concern illustrate
two points which I am anxious to stress: the manifold aspects, relations and effects of every
concrete element of the social pattern that preclude simple and one-way propositions, and the
importance of distinguishing short-run and long-run phenomena for which different, sometimes
opposite, propositions hold true. The large-scale newspaper concern is in most cases simply a
capitalist business enterprise. This does not imply that it espouses capitalist or any other class
interests. It may do so, but only from one or more of the following motives, the limited
importance of which is obvious: because it is subsidized by a capitalist group for the very
purpose of advocating its interests or views—the larger the concern and its sales, the less
important this element; because it intends to sell to a public of bourgeois tastes—this, very
important until about 1914, now increasingly cuts the other way; because advertisers prefer to
use a congenial medium—but mostly they take a very businesslike view of the matter; because
the owners insist on a certain course irrespective of their interest in sales—to a certain extent,
they do and especially did, but experience teaches that they do not hold out if the conflict with
their pecuniary interest in sales is too severe. In other words, the large-scale newspaper concern
is a most powerful tool for raising the position and increasing the influence of the intellectual
group, but it is even now not completely in its control. It means employment and a wider public,
but it also means “strings.” These are mainly of importance in the short run; in fighting for
greater freedom to do as he pleases, the individual journalist may easily meet defeat. But this
short-run aspect—and the group’s recollection of past conditions—are what enters the
intellectual’s mind and what determines the colors of the picture of slavery and martyrdom he
draws for the public. In reality, it should be a picture of conquest. Conquest and victory are in
this, as in so many other cases, a mosaic composed of defeats. -->

There is, however, another factor. One of the most important fea tures
of the later stages of capitalist civilization is the vigorous expansion of the
educational apparatus and particularly of the facilities for higher education.
This development was and is no less inevitable than the development of
the largest-scale industrial unit, 9 but, unlike the latter, it has been and is
being fostered by public opinion and public authority so as to go much
further than it would have done under its own steam. Whatever we may
think of this from other standpoints and whatever the precise causation,
there are several consequences that bear upon the size and attitude of the
intellectual group.

First, inasmuch as higher education thus increases the supply of services
in professional, quasi-professional and in the end all “whitecollar” lines
beyond the point determined by cost-return considerations, it may create a
particularly important case of sectional unemployment.
Second, along with or in place of such unemployment, it creates
unsatisfactory conditions of employment—employment in substandard work
or at wages below those of the better-paid manual workers.
Third, it may create unemployability of a particularly disconcerting
type. The man who has gone through a college or university easily
becomes psychically unemployable in manual occupations without
necessarily acquiring employability in, say, professional work. His
failure to do so may be due either to lack of natural ability—perfectly
compatible with passing academic tests—or to inadequate teaching; and
both cases will, absolutely and relatively, occur more frequently as ever
larger numbers are drafted into higher education and as the required
amount of teaching increases irrespective of how many teachers and
scholars nature chooses to turn out. The results of neglecting this and
of acting on the theory that schools, colleges and universities are just
a matter of money, are too obvious to insist upon. Cases in which
among a dozen applicants for a job, all formally qualified, there is not
one who can fill it satisfactorily, are known to everyone who has
anything to do with appointments—to everyone, that is, who is himself
qualified to judge.

<!-- 9 At present this development is viewed by most people from the standpoint of the ideal of
making educational facilities of any type available to all who can be induced to use them. This
ideal is so strongly held that any doubts about it are almost universally considered to be nothing
short of indecent, a situation not improved by the comments, all too often flippant, of
dissentients. Actually, we brush here against a set of extremely complex problems of the
sociology of education and educational ideals which we cannot attack within the limits of this
sketch. This is why I have confined the above paragraph to two incontestable and noncommittal
trivialities that are all we want for the purpose in hand. But of course they do not dispose of
the larger problems which must be left aside to testify to the incompleteness of my exposition. -->

All those who are unemployed or unsatisfactorily employed or
unemployable drift into the vocations in which standards are least definite
or in which aptitudes and acquirements of a different order count. They swell
the host of intellectuals in the strict sense of the term whose numbers hence
increase disproportionately. They enter it in a thoroughly discontented frame
of mind. Discontent breeds resentment. And it often rationalizes itself into
that social criticism which as we have seen before is in any case the
intellectual spectator’s typical attitude toward men, classes and institutions
especially in a rationalist and utilitarian civilization. Well, here we have
numbers; a well-defined group situation of proletarian hue; and a group
interest shaping a group attitude that will much more realistically account
for hostility to the capitalist order than could the theory—itself a
rationalization in the psychological sense—according to which the
intellectual’s righteous indignation about the wrongs of capitalism simply
represents the logical inference from outrageous facts and which is no better
than the theory of lovers that their feelings represent nothing but the logical
inference from the virtues of the beloved. 10 Moreover our theory also
accounts for the fact that this hostility increases, instead of diminishing, with
every achievement of capitalist evolution.

Of course, the hostility of the intellectual group—amounting to moral
disapproval of the capitalist order—is one thing, and the general hostile
atmosphere which surrounds the capitalist engine is another thing. The latter
is the really significant phenomenon; and it is not simply the product of the
former but flows partly from independent sources, some of which have been
mentioned before; so far as it does, it is raw material for the intellectual
group to work on. There are give-and-take relations between the two which
it would require more space to unravel than I can spare. The general contours
of such an analysis are however sufficiently obvious and I think it safe to
repeat that the role of the intellectual group consists primarily in stimulating,
energizing, verbalizing and organizing this material and only secondarily in
adding to it. Some particular aspects will illustrate the principle.
6. Capitalist evolution produces a labor movement which obviously is
not the creation of the intellectual group. But it is not surprising that such
an opportunity and the intellectual demiurge should find each other.
Labor never craved intellectual leadership but intellectuals invaded labor
politics. They had an important contribution to make: they verbalized the
10 The reader will observe that any such theories would be unrealistic even if the facts of
capitalism or the virtues of the beloved were actually all that the social critic or the lover
believes them to be. It is also important to note that in the overwhelming majority of cases
both critics and lovers are obviously sincere; neither psycho-sociological nor psycho-physical
mechanisms enter as a rule into the limelight of the Ego, except in the mask of sublimations.
Can Capitalism Survive?154
movement, supplied theories and slogans for it—class war is an excellent
example—made it conscious of itself and in doing so changed its
meaning. In solving this task from their own standpoint, they naturally
radicalized it, eventually imparting a revolutionary bias to the most
bourgeois trade-union practices, a bias most of the non-intellectual
leaders at first greatly resented. But there was another reason for this.
Listening to the intellectual, the workman is almost invariably conscious
of an impassable gulf if not of downright distrust. In order to get hold
of him and to compete with non-intellectual leaders, the intellectual is
driven to courses entirely unnecessary for the latter who can afford to
frown. Having no genuine authority and feeling always in danger of
being unceremoniously told to mind his own business, he must flatter,
promise and incite, nurse left wings and scowling minorities, sponsor
doubtful or submarginal cases, appeal to fringe ends, profess himself
ready to obey—in short, behave toward the masses as his predecessors
behaved first toward their ecclesiastical superiors, later toward princes
and other individual patrons, still later toward the collective master of
bourgeois complexion. 11 Thus, though intellectuals have not created the
labor movement, they have yet worked it up into something that differs
substantially from what it would be without them.
The social atmosphere, for the theory of which we have been gathering
stones and mortar, explains why public policy grows more and more hostile
to capitalist interests, eventually so much so as to refuse on principle to take
account of the requirements of the capitalist engine and to become a serious
impediment to its functioning. The intellectual group’s activities have
however a relation to anti-capitalist policies that is more direct than what is
implied in their share in verbalizing them. Intellectuals rarely enter
professional politics and still more rarely conquer responsible office. But
they staff political bureaus, write party pamphlets and speeches, act as
secretaries and advisers, make the individual politician’s newspaper
reputation which, though it is not everything, few men can afford to neglect.
In doing these things they to some extent impress their mentality on almost
everything that is being done.

<!-- 11 All this will be illustrated and further developed in Part V. -->

The actual influence exerted varies greatly with the state of the political
game from mere formulation to making a measure politically possible or
impossible. But there is always plenty of scope for it. When we say that
individual politicians and parties are exponents of class interests we are at
best emphasizing one-half of the truth. The other half, just as important if
not more so, comes into view when we consider that politics is a profession which evolves interests of its own—interests that may clash with as well
as conform to the interests of the groups that a man or party “represents.” 12


Individual and party opinion is, more than anything else, sensitive to those
factors in the political situation that directly affect the career or the
standing of the individual or party. Some of these are controlled by the
intellectual group in much the same sense as is the moral code of an epoch
that exalts the cause of some interests and puts the cause of others tacitly
out of court.

Finally, that social atmosphere or code of values affects not only
policies—the spirit of legislation—but also administrative practice. But again
there is also a more direct relation between the intellectual group and
bureaucracy. The bureaucracies of Europe are of pre- and extra-capitalist
origin. However much they may have changed in composition as the
centuries rolled on, they never identified themselves wholly with the
bourgeoisie, its interests or its scheme of values, and never saw much more
in it than an asset to be managed in the interest of the monarch or of the
nation. Except for inhibitions due to professional training and experience,
they are therefore open to conversion by the modern intellectual with whom,
through a similar education, they have much in common, 13 while the tinge
of gentility that in many cases used to raise a barrier has been fading away
from the modern civil servant during the last decades. Moreover, in times
of rapid expansion of the sphere of public administration, much of the
additional personnel required has to be taken directly from the intellectual
group—witness this country.

<!-- 12 This of course is just as true of the intellectuals themselves with respect to the class from
which they come or to which, economically and culturally, they belong. The subject will be
taken up again in ch. xxiii.
