## A WARNING

IT IS likely that many opponents of socialism will accept my result.

But their assent will mostly take the following form: 

“Oh well, of course, if you had demigods to direct the socialist engine and
archangels to man it, all that might well be so. But the point is that you have
not and that, human nature being what it is, the capitalist alternative with its
pattern of motivations and its distribution of responsibilities and rewards after
all offers, though not the best conceivable, yet the best practicable arrangement.”

There is something to this reply. 

On the one hand, we have now to
guard not only against the dangers that lurk in any attempt to compare a
given reality with an idea, but also against the error or trick inherent i0n any
comparison of a given reality with an ideal. 1 On the other hand, though I
think I have made it abundantly clear that in the nature of things there never
can be a general case for socialism but only a case with reference to given
social conditions and given historical stages, this relativity becomes much
more important now than it was as long as we moved among blueprints.

I. The Historical Relativity Of The Argument

To illustrate this point by an analogy. In feudal society, much of what all of
us, the staunchest supporters of private property included, now think of as
1 An idea or schema or model or blueprint also embodies an ideal, but only in the logical
sense; such an ideal means only absence of non-essentials—the unadulterated design as we
might say. Of course it remains a debatable question exactly what should be included in it and
what should, in consequence, be regarded as deviation. Though this should be a question of
analytic technique, love and hate may enter into it nevertheless: socialists will tend to include
in the blueprint of capitalism as many traits as possible that are felt to be derogatory; anti-
socialists will do the same to the socialist blueprint; and both parties will try to “whitewash”
their own by listing as many “blemishes” as possible among unessential, hence by implication
avoidable, deviations. Even if they agree in any given case to label certain phenomena as
deviations, they may still disagree as to the degree to which their own system and that of their
opponents are liable to deviate. For instance, bourgeois economists will tend to attribute to
“political interference” whatever they themselves do not like about capitalism while socialists
will hold that these politics are the inevitable outcome of capitalist processes and situations
created by the way in which the capitalist engine works. Although I recognize all these
difficulties, I do not think that they affect ray exposition which as the professional reader will
notice, has been framed so as to avoid them.

the exclusive domain of public administration was managed by means of an
arrangement that to us looks as if those public functions had been made the
objects of private ownership and the sources of private gain; every knight
or lord in a hierarchy of liege relations held his fief for profit and not as a
payment for the services he rendered in managing it. The now so-called
public functions connected with it were but a reward for services rendered
to some superior liege. Even this does not quite express the matter: he held
his fief because, being a knight or lord, he was entitled to hold one whatever
he did or did not do. 

This state of things people who lack the historical
dimension are prone to look upon as a compound of “abuses.” But that is
nonsense. Under the circumstances of its own epoch—like every bit of
institutional framework, feudalism survived what was truly “its” epoch—this
arrangement was the only feasible one and it embodied the only method by
which those public functions could be discharged. If Karl Marx had put in
appearance, say, in the fourteenth century and if he had been so foolish as
to advocate another method of public administration, then he would have laid
himself open to the reply that such a system was an admirable device for
getting done what without it could not have been done at all and in particular
that “human nature being what it is” the profit motive was indispensable for
the functioning of public administration; its elimination would in fact have
spelled chaos and could have been well described as an impracticable dream.
Similarly, at the time when the English textile mill was the high spot of
capitalist economy—up to 1850, say—socialism was not a practical
proposition and no sensible socialist would hold now or did hold then that
it was. 

The master’s eye that makes the cattle fat and turns sand to gold, the
goose that lays the golden eggs and other such homely phrases then were
but the expression, by and for simple and slow-witted people, of an
undeniable truth. I submit to socialist friends that there is a better way of
encountering them than sneering—sneering in the hope that the opponent,
a vain and touchy intellectual like themselves, will cease to argue as soon
as he perceives that he may encounter ridicule: it is better to recognize the
rightful claim of those geese within their proper historical setting and confine
denial to other historical settings. We shall then at least face the relevant
question—to wit, how much there is to them now—and still retain plenty of
parking space for our disagreements.

Since we must visualize a definite pattern of capitalism if comparison
of capitalist reality with socialist chances of success is to have any
meaning, let us choose the capitalism of our own epoch, that is to say,
big-business capitalism in fetters. And let us observe first, that though
this defines an epoch and a pattern it does not define any particular date,
not even in terms of decades, because the question how far the pattern of fettered capitalism has developed and stabilized its features at any
given time, say at present, would still have to wait upon factual
investigation; second, that for this part of our argument it becomes
irrelevant whether those fetters, whatever they are, have been evolved by
the capitalist process itself or may be looked upon as something imposed
upon it by an agency that stands outside of it; third, that though we are
now going to deal with somewhat more practical problems—namely, how
far socialism can be expected to reap the harvest that is potentially
present in its blueprint—we shall still be speaking of chances only and
that assumptions will have to step in to remedy our ignorance about what
kind of socialism will be our fate.
