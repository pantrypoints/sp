<!-- THE CLASSICAL DOCTRINE OF DEMOCRACY -->

THE 18th-century philosophy of democracy has the following definition: the democratic method is that institutional
arrangement for arriving at political decisions which realizes the common good
by making the people itself decide issues through the election of individuals
who are to assemble in order to carry out its will. 

It is held, then, that there exists a Common Good, the obvious beacon light
of policy, which is always simple to define and which every normal person
can be made to see by means of rational argument. There is hence no excuse
for not seeing it and in fact no explanation for the presence of people who do
not see it except ignorance—which can be removed—stupidity and anti-social
interest. Moreover, this common good implies definite answers to all questions
so that every social fact and every measure taken or to be taken can un-
equivocally be classed as “good” or “bad.” 

All people having therefore to
agree, in principle at least, there is also a Common Will of the people (=will
of all reasonable individuals) that is exactly coterminous with the common
good or interest or welfare or happiness. The only thing, barring stupidity and
sinister interests, that can possibly bring in disagreement and account for the
presence of an opposition is a difference of opinion as to the speed with which
the goal, itself common to nearly all, is to be approached. Thus every member
of the community, conscious of that goal, knowing his or her mind, discerning
what is good and what is bad, takes part, actively and responsibly, in furthering
the former and fighting the latter and all the members taken together control
their public affairs.

It is true that the management of some of these affairs requires special
aptitudes and techniques and will therefore have to be entrusted to specialists
who have them. This does not affect the principle, however, because these
specialists simply act in order to carry out the will of the people exactly as
a doctor acts in order to carry out the will of the patient to get well. It is
also true that in a community of any size, especially if it displays the
phenomenon of division of labor, it would be highly inconvenient for every
individual citizen to have to get into contact with all the other citizens on every issue in order to do his part in ruling or governing. It will be more
convenient to reserve only the most important decisions for the individual
citizens to pronounce upon—say by referendum—and to deal with the rest
through a committee appointed by them—an assembly or parliament whose
members will be elected by popular vote. This committee or body of
delegates, as we have seen, will not represent the people in a legal sense but
it will do so in a less technical one—it will voice, reflect or represent the
will of the electorate. Again as a matter of convenience, this committee,
being large, may resolve itself into smaller ones for the various departments
of public affairs. Finally, among these smaller committees there will be a
general-purpose committee, mainly for dealing with current administration,
called cabinet or government, possibly with a general secretary or scapegoat
at its head, a so-called prime minister. 1

As soon as we accept all the assumptions that are being made by this
theory of the polity—or implied by it—democracy indeed acquires a
perfectly unambiguous meaning and there is no problem in connection with
it except how to bring it about. Moreover we need only forget a few logical
qualms in order to be able to add that in this case the democratic
arrangement would not only be the best of all conceivable ones, but that few
people would care to consider any other. It is no less obvious however that
these assumptions are so many statements of fact every one of which would
have to be proved if we are to arrive at that conclusion. And it is much easier
to disprove them.

There is, first, no such thing as a uniquely determined common good that
all people could agree on or be made to agree on by the force of rational
argument. This is due not primarily to the fact that some people may want
things other than the common good but to the much more fundamental fact
that to different individuals and groups the common good is bound to mean
different things. This fact, hidden from the utilitarian by the narrowness of his
outlook on the world of human valuations, will introduce rifts on questions
of principle which cannot be reconciled by rational argument because ultimate
values—our conceptions of what life and what society should be—are beyond
the range of mere logic. 

They may be bridged by compromise in some cases
but not in others. Americans who say, “We want this country to arm to its teeth
and then to fight for what we conceive to be right all over the globe” and
Americans who say, “We want this country to work out its own problems
which is the only way it can serve humanity” are facing irreducible differences
of ultimate values which compromise could only maim and degrade.

<!-- 1 The official theory of the functions of a cabinet minister holds in fact that he is appointed
in order to see to it that in his department the will of the people prevails. -->

2. Even if a sufficiently definite common good—such as for instance the utilitarian’s maximum of economic satisfaction 2 —proved acceptable to all, this would not imply equally definite answers to individual
issues. Opinions on these might differ to an extent important enough to
produce most of the effects of “fundamental” dissension about ends
themselves. 

The problems centering in the evaluation of present versus future
satisfactions, even the case of socialism versus capitalism, would be left still
open, for instance, after the conversion of every individual citizen to
utilitarianism. “Health” might be desired by all, yet people would still
disagree on vaccination and vasectomy. And so on.

The utilitarian fathers of democratic doctrine failed to see the full
importance of this simply because none of them seriously considered any
substantial change in the economic framework and the habits of bourgeois
society. They saw little beyond the world of an eighteenth-century
ironmonger.

3. As a consequence of both preceding propositions, the particular
concept of the will of the people or the volonté générale that the utilitarians
made their own vanishes into thin air. For that concept presupposes the
existence of a uniquely determined common good discernible to all. 

Unlike
the romanticists the utilitarians had no notion of that semi-mystic entity
endowed with a will of its own—that “soul of the people” which the historical
school of jurisprudence made so much of. They frankly derived their will of
the people from the wills of individuals. And unless there is a center, the
common good, toward which, in the long run at least, all individual wills
gravitate, we shall not get that particular type of “natural” volonté générale.
The utilitarian center of gravity, on the one hand, unifies individual wills, tends
to weld them by means of rational discussion into the will of the people and,
on the other hand, confers upon the latter the exclusive ethical dignity claimed
by the classic democratic creed.

This creed does not consist simply in
worshiping the will of the people as such but rests on certain assumptions
about the “natural” object of that will which object is sanctioned by utilitarian
reason. Both the existence and the dignity of this kind of volonté générale are
gone as soon as the idea of the common good fails us. And both the pillars of
the classical doctrine inevitably crumble into dust.
