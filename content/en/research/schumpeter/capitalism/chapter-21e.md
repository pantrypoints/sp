IV. REASONS F OR T HE S URVIVAL O F T HE C LASSICAL D OCTRINE

<!-- 18 Selective information, if in itself correct, is an attempt to lie by speaking the truth.

institution. -->

But how is it possible that a doctrine so patently contrary to fact should have
survived to this day and continued to hold its place in the hearts of the people and in the official language of governments? 

The refuting facts are known
to all; everybody admits them with perfect, frequently with cynical,
frankness. The theoretical basis, utilitarian rationalism, is dead; nobody
accepts it as a correct theory of the body politic. Nevertheless that question
is not difficult to answer.

The classical doctrine of collective action is not supported by the results of empirical analysis.

But it is powerfully supported by association with religious belief.

The utilitarian leaders were anything but religious in the ordinary sense of the term. In fact they believed themselves
to be anti-religious and they were so considered almost universally. They
took pride in what they thought was precisely an unmetaphysical attitude and
they were quite out of sympathy with the religious institutions and the
religious movements of their time. 

But we need only cast another glance at
the picture they drew of the social process in order to discover that it
embodied essential features of the faith of protestant Christianity and was
in fact derived from that faith. For the intellectual who had cast off his
religion the utilitarian creed provided a substitute for it. For many of those
who had retained their religious belief the classical doctrine became the
political complement of it. 20

Thus transposed into the categories of religion, this doctrine—and in
consequence the kind of democratic persuasion which is based upon it—
changes its very nature. There is no longer any need for logical scruples
about the Common Good and Ultimate Values. All this is settled for us by
the plan of the Creator whose purpose defines and sanctions everything.
What seemed indefinite or unmotivated before is suddenly quite definite
and convincing. 

The voice of the people that is the voice of God for
instance. Or take Equality. Its very meaning is in doubt, and there is hardly
any rational warrant for exalting it into a postulate, so long as we move in
the sphere of empirical analysis. But Christianity harbors a strong
equalitarian element. The Redeemer died for all: He did not differentiate
between individuals of different social status. In doing so, He testified to
the intrinsic value of the individual soul, a value that admits of no
gradations. Is not this a sanction—and, as it seems to me, the only possible

<!-- 20 Observe the analogy with socialist belief which also is a substitute for Christian belief
to some and a complement of it to others. -->


21 It might be objected that, however difficult it may be to attach a general meaning to the
word Equality, such meaning can be unraveled from its context in most if not all cases. For
instance, it may be permissible to infer from the circumstances in which the Gettysburg address
was delivered that by the “proposition that all men are created free and equal,” Lincoln simply
meant equality of legal status versus the kind of inequality that is implied in the recognition
of slavery. This meaning would be definite enough. But if we ask why that proposition should sanction 21 —of “everyone to count for one, no one to count for more than one”—a sanction that pours super-mundane meaning into articles of the
democratic creed for which it is not easy to find any other? To be sure this
interpretation does not cover the whole ground. However, so far as it goes,
it seems to explain many things that otherwise would be unexplainable and
in fact meaningless. In particular, it explains the believer’s attitude toward
criticism: again, as in the case of socialism, fundamental dissent is looked
upon not merely as error but as sin; it elicits not merely logical
counterargument but also moral indignation.

We may put our problem differently and say that democracy, when
motivated in this way, ceases to be a mere method that can be discussed
rationally like a steam engine or a disinfectant. It actually becomes what from
another standpoint I have held it incapable of becoming, viz., an ideal or rather
a part of an ideal schema of things. The very word may become a flag, a
symbol of all a man holds dear, of everything that he loves about his nation
whether rationally contingent to it or not. On the one hand, the question how
the various propositions implied in the democratic belief are related to the facts
of politics will then become as irrelevant to him as is, to the believing Catholic,
the question how the doings of Alexander VI tally with the supernatural halo
surrounding the papal office. On the other hand, the democrat of this type,
while accepting postulates carrying large implications about equality and
brotherliness, will be in a position also to accept, in all sincerity, almost any
amount of deviations from them that his own behavior or position may involve.
That is not even illogical. Mere distance from fact is no argument against an
ethical maxim or a mystical hope.

Second, there is the fact that the forms and phrases of classical democracy
are for many nations associated with events and developments in their history
which are enthusiastically approved by large majorities. Any opposition to
an established regime is likely to use these forms and phrases whatever its
meaning and social roots may be. 22 If it prevails and if subsequent
developments prove satisfactory, then these forms will take root in the
national ideology.

The United States is the outstanding example. Its very existence as a
sovereign state is associated with a struggle against a monarchial and
aristocratic England. A minority of loyalists excepted, Americans had, at the
be morally and politically binding and if we refuse to answer “Because every man is by nature
exactly like every other man,” then we can only fall back upon the divine sanction supplied by
Christian belief. This solution is conceivably implied in the word “created.” 

time of the Grenville administration, probably ceased to look upon the
English monarch as their king and the English aristocracy as their
aristocracy. In the War of Independence they fought what in fact as well as
in their feeling had become a foreign monarch and a foreign aristocracy who
interfered with their political and economic interests. Yet from an early stage
of the troubles they presented their case, which really was a national one,
as a case of the “people” versus its “rulers,” in terms of inalienable Rights
of Man and in the light of the general principles of classical democracy. The
wording of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution adopted
these principles. A prodigious development followed that absorbed and
satisfied most people and thereby seemed to verify the doctrine embalmed
in the sacred documents of the nation.

<!-- 22 It might seem that an exception should be made for oppositions that issue into frankly
autocratic regimes. But even most of these rose, as a matter of history, in democratic ways and
based their rule on the approval of the people. Caesar was not killed by plebeians. But the
aristocratic oligarchs who did kill him also used democratic phrases. -->

Oppositions rarely conquer when the groups in possession are in the
prime of their power and success. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
the oppositions that professed the classical creed of democracy rose and
eventually prevailed against governments some of which—especially in
Italy—were obviously in a state of decay and had become bywords of
incompetence, brutality and corruption. 

Naturally though not quite logically,
this redounded to the credit of that creed which moreover showed up to
advantage when compared with the benighted superstitions sponsored by
those governments. Under these circumstances, democratic revolution meant
the advent of freedom and decency, and the democratic creed meant a gospel
of reason and betterment. To be sure, this advantage was bound to be lost
and the gulf between the doctrine and the practice of democracy was bound
to be discovered. But the glamour of the dawn was slow to fade.

Third, it must not be forgotten that there are social patterns in which the
classical doctrine will actually fit facts with a sufficient degree of
approximation. As has been pointed out, this is the case with many small and
primitive societies which as a matter of fact served as a prototype to the
authors of that doctrine. 

Non primitive societies that are not too differentiated and do not harbor any
serious problems. Switzerland is the best example. There is so little to quarrel
about in a world of peasants which, excepting hotels and banks, contains no
great capitalist industry, and the problems of public policy are so simple and
so stable that an overwhelming majority can be expected to understand them
and to agree about them. But if we can conclude that in such cases the
classical doctrine approximates reality we have to add immediately that it
does so not because it describes an effective mechanism of political decision
but only because there are no great decisions to be made. 

Finally, the case
of the United States may again be invoked in order to show that the classical
doctrine sometimes appears to fit facts even in a society that is big and highly differentiated and in which there are great issues to decide provided the sting is taken out of them by favorable conditions. Until this country’s entry into
the First World War, the public mind was concerned mainly with the business
of exploiting the economic possibilities of the environment. 

So long as this business was not seriously interfered with nothing mattered fundamentally
to the average citizen who looked on the antics of politicians with good-
natured contempt. Sections might get excited over the tariff, over silver, over
local misgovernment, or over an occasional squabble with England. The
people at large did not care much, except in the one case of serious
disagreement which in fact produced national disaster, the Civil War.
And fourth, of course, politicians appreciate a phraseology that flatters the
masses and offers an excellent opportunity not only for evading
responsibility but also for crushing opponents in the name of the people.
