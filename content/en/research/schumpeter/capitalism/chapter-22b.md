The theory outlined in the preceding section we are now going to try out
on some of the more important features of the structure and working of the
political engine in democratic countries.

1. In a democracy, as I have said, the primary function of the elector’s
vote is to produce government. This may mean the election of a complete
set of individual officers. This practice however is in the main a feature of
local government and will be neglected henceforth. 8 Considering national
government only, we may say that producing government practically
amounts to deciding who the leading man shall be. 9 As before, we shall call
him Prime Minister.

<!-- 8 This we shall do for simplicity’s sake only. The phenomenon fits perfectly into our schema.
9 This is only approximately true. The elector’s vote does indeed put into power a group
that in all normal cases acknowledges an individual leader but there are as a rule leaders of
second and third rank who carry political guns in their own right and whom the leader has no
choice but to put into appropriate offices. This fact will be recognized presently.
Another point must be kept in mind. Although there is reason to expect that a man who
rises to a position of supreme command will in general be a man of considerable personal
force, whatever else he may be—to this we shall return later on—it does not follow that this
will always be the case. Therefore the term “leader” or “leading man” is not to imply that
the individuals thus designated are necessarily endowed with qualities of leadership or that
they always do give any personal leads. There are political situations favorable to the rise of
men deficient in leadership (and other qualities) and unfavorable to the establishment of
strong individual positions. A party or a combination of parties hence may occasionally be
acephalous. But everyone recognizes that this is a pathological state and one of the typical
causes of defeat.

10 We may, I take it, disregard the electoral college. In calling the President of the
United States a prime minister I wish to stress the fundamental similarity of his position
to that of prime ministers in other democracies. But I do not wish to minimize the
differences, although some of them are more formal than real. The least important of them
is that the President also fulfills those largely ceremonial functions of, say, the French -->

There is only one democracy in which the electorate’s vote does this directly, viz., the United States. 10 In all other cases the electorate’s vote does not directly produce government but an intermediate organ, henceforth called
parliament, 11 upon which the government-producing function devolves. It
might seem easy to account for the adoption or rather the evolution of this
arrangement, both on historical grounds and on grounds of expediency, and
for the various forms it took in different social patterns. But it is not a logical
construct; it is a natural growth the subtle meanings and results of which
completely escape the official, let alone legal, doctrines.

How does a parliament produce government? The most obvious method
is to elect it or, more realistically, to elect the prime minister and then to vote
the list of ministers he presents. This method is rarely used. 12 But it brings
out the nature of the procedure better than any of the others. Moreover, these
can all be reduced to it, because the man who becomes prime minister is in
all normal cases the one whom parliament would elect. The way in which
he is actually appointed to office, by a monarch as in England, by a President
as in France or by a special agency or committee as in the Prussian Free
State of the Weimar period, is merely a matter of form.

The classical English practice is this. After a general election the
victorious party normally commands a majority of seats in Parliament and
thus is in a position to carry a vote of want of confidence against everyone
except its own leader who in this negative way is designated “by
Parliament” for national leadership. He receives his commission from the
monarch—“kisses hands”—and presents to him his list of ministers of
which the list of cabinet ministers is a part. In this he includes, first, some
presidents. Much more important is it that he cannot dissolve Congress—but neither could
the French Prime Minister do so. On the other hand, his position is stronger than that of
the English Prime Minister by virtue of the fact that his leadership is independent of his
having a majority in Congress—at least legally; for as a matter of fact he is checkmated
if he has none. Also, he can appoint and dismiss cabinet officers (almost) at will. The latter
can hardly be called ministers in the English sense of the word and are really no more than
the word “secretary” conveys in common parlance. We might say, therefore, that in a sense
the President is not only prime minister but sole minister, unless we find an analogy
between the functions of an English Cabinet minister and the functions of the managers
of the administration’s forces in Congress.

There is no difficulty about interpreting and explaining these and many other
peculiarities in this or any other country that uses the democratic method. But in order to
save space we shall mainly think of the English pattern and consider all other cases as more
or less important “deviations” on the theory that thus far the logic of democratic
government has worked itself out most completely in the English practice though not in
its legal forms.

<!-- 11 It will be recalled that I have defined parliament as an organ of the state. Although
that was done simply for reasons of formal (legal) logic this definition fits in particularly
well with our conception of the democratic method. Membership in parliament is hence
an office.

12 For example, it was adopted in Austria after the breakdown in 1918. -->

party veterans who receive what might be called complimentary office;
secondly, the leaders of the second rank, those men on whom he counts
for the current fighting in Parliament and who owe their preferment partly
to their positive political value and partly to their value as potential
nuisances; third, the rising men whom he invites to the charmed circle of
office in order to “extract the brains from below the gangway”; and
sometimes, fourth, a few men whom he thinks particularly well qualified
to fill certain offices.13 But again, in all normal cases this practice will tend
to produce the same result as election by Parliament would. The reader will
also see that where, as in England, the prime minster has the actual power
to dissolve (“to go to the country”), the result will to some extent
approximate the result we should expect from direct election of the cabinet
by the electorate so long as the latter supports him. 14 This may be
illustrated by a famous instance.

2. In 1879, when the Beaconsfield (Disraeli) government, after almost
six years of prosperous tenure of power culminating in the spectacular
success of the Congress of Berlin, 15 was on all ordinary counts entitled to
expect a success at the polls, Gladstone suddenly roused the country by a
series of addresses of unsurpassable force (Midlothian campaign) which
played up Turkish atrocities so successfully as to place him on the crest
of a wave of popular enthusiasm for him personally. The official party had
nothing to do with it. Several of its leaders in fact disapproved. Gladstone

<!-- 13 To lament, as some people do, how little fitness for office counts in these arrangements
is beside the point where description is concerned; it is of the essence of democratic government
that political values should count primarily and fitness only incidentally. See below, ch. xxiii.
14 If, as was the case in France, the prime minister has no such power, parliamentary
coteries acquire so much independence that this parallelism between acceptance of a man
by parliament and acceptance of the same man by the electorate is weakened or destroyed.
This is the situation in which the parlor game of parliamentary politics runs riot. From our
standpoint this is a deviation from the design of the machine. Raymond Poincaré was of
the same opinion. -->

Of course, such situations also occur in England. For the Prime Minister’s power to
dissolve—strictly, his power to “advise” the monarch to dissolve the House of
Commons—is inoperative either if his party’s inner circle sets its face against it or if
there is no chance that elections will strengthen his hold upon Parliament. That is to say,
he may be stronger (though possibly still weak) in Parliament than he is in the country.
Such a state of things tends to develop with some regularity after a government has been
in power for some years. But under the English system this deviation from design cannot
last very long.

15 I do not mean that the temporary settlement of the questions raised by the Russo Turkish
War and the acquisition of the perfectly useless island of Cyprus were in themselves such
masterpieces of statesmanship. But I do mean that from the standpoint of domestic politics they
were just the kind of showy success that would normally flatter the average citizen’s vanity
and would greatly enhance the government’s prospects in an atmosphere of jingo patriotism.
In fact it was the general opinion that Disraeli would have won if he had dissolved immediately
on returning from Berlin.

had resigned the leadership years before and tackled the country single-
handed. But when the liberal party under this impetus had won a smashing
victory, it was obvious to everyone that he had to be again accepted as the
party leader—nay, that he had become the party leader by virtue of his
national leadership and that there simply was no room for any other. He
came into power in a halo of glory.

Now this instance teaches us a lot about the working of the democratic
method. To begin with, it must be realized that it is unique only in its
dramatic quality, but in nothing else. It is the oversized specimen of a normal
genus. The cases of both Pitts, Peel, Palmerston, Disraeli, Campbell
Bannerman and others differ from it only in degree.

First, as to the Prime Minister’s political leadership. 16 Our example shows
that it is composed of three different elements which must not be confused
and which in every case mix in different proportions, the mixture then
determining the nature of every individual Prime Minister’s rule. On the face
of it, he comes into office as the leading man of his party in Parliament.

<!-- 16 It is characteristic of the English way of doing things that official recognition of
the existence of the Prime Minister’s office was deferred until 1907, when it was allowed
to appear in the official order of precedence at court. But it is as old as democratic
government. However, since democratic government was never introduced by a distinct
act but slowly evolved as part of a comprehensive social process, it is not easy to indicate
even an approximate birthday or birth period. There is a long stretch that presents
embryonic cases. It is tempting to date the institution from the reign of William III,
whose position, so much weaker than that of the native rulers had been, seems to give
color to the idea. The objection to this however is not so much that England was no
“democracy” then—the reader will recall that we do not define democracy by the extent
of the franchise—as that, on the one hand, the embryonic case of Danby had occurred
under Charles II and that, on the other hand, William III never reconciled himself to the
arrangement and kept certain matters successfully in his own hands. We must not of
course confuse prime ministers with mere advisers, however powerful with their sovereign
and however firmly entrenched in the very center of the public power plant they may be—
such men as Richelieu, Mazarin or Strafford for instance. Godolphin and Harley under
Queen Anne were clearly transitional cases. The first man to be universally recognized
at the time and by political historians was Sir Robert Walpole. But he as well as the Duke
of Newcastle (or his brother Henry Pelham or both jointly) and in fact all the leading
men down to Lord Shelburne (including the elder Pitt who even as foreign secretary came
very near to fulfilling our requirements in substance) lack one or another of the
characteristics. The first full-fledged specimen was the younger Pitt.
It is interesting to note that what his own time recognized in the case of Sir Robert
Walpole (and later in that of Lord Carteret [Earl of Granville]) was not that here was an
organ essential to democratic government that was breaking through atrophic tissues. On
the contrary, public opinion felt it to be a most vicious cancer the growth of which was
a menace to the national welfare and to democracy—“sole minister” or “first minister”
was a term of opprobrium hurled at Walpole by his enemies. This fact is significant. It
not only indicates the resistance new institutions usually meet with. It also indicates that
this institution was felt to be incompatible with the classic doctrine of democracy which
in fact has no place for political leadership in our sense, hence no place for the realities
of the position of a prime minister. -->

As soon as installed however, he becomes in a sense the leader of Parliament,
directly of the house of which he is a member, indirectly also of the other.
This is more than an official euphemism, more also than is implied in his
hold upon his own party. He acquires influence on, or excites the antipathy
of, the other parties and individual members of the other parties as well, and
this makes a lot of difference in his chances of success. In the limiting case,
best exemplified by the practice of Sir Robert Peel, he may coerce his own
party by means of another. Finally, though in all normal cases he will also
be the head of his party in the country, the well-developed specimen of the
prime ministerial genus will have a position in the country distinct from what
he automatically acquires by heading the party organization. He will lead
party opinion creatively—shape it—and eventually rise toward a formative
leadership of public opinion beyond the lines of party, toward national
leadership that may to some extent become independent of mere party
opinion. It is needless to say how very personal such an achievement is and
how great the importance of such a foothold outside of both party and
Parliament. It puts a whip into the hand of the leader the crack of which may
bring unwilling and conspiring followers to heel, though its thong will
sharply hit the hand that uses it unsuccessfully.

This suggests an important qualification to our proposition that in a
parliamentary system the function of producing a government devolves
upon parliament. Parliament does normally decide who will be Prime
Minister, but in doing so it is not completely free. It decides by acceptance
rather than by initiative. Excepting pathological cases like the French
chambre, the wishes of members are not as a rule the ultimate data of the
process from which government emerges. Members are not only
handcuffed by party obligations. They also are driven by the man whom
they “elect”—driven to the act of the “election” itself exactly as they are
driven by him once they have “elected” him. Every horse is of course free
to kick over the traces and it does not always run up to its bit. But revolt
or passive resistance against the leader’s lead only shows up the normal
relation. And this normal relation is of the essence of the
democratic.method. Gladstone’s personal victory in 1880 is the answer to
the official theory that Parliament creates and cashiers government. 17
17 Gladstone himself upheld that theory strongly. In 1874, when defeated at the polls,
he still argued for meeting Parliament because it was up to Parliament to pass the
sentence of dismissal. This of course means nothing at all. In the same way he studiously
professed unbounded deference to the crown. One biographer after another has marveled
at this courtly attitude of the great democratic leader. But surely Queen Victoria showed
better discernment than did those biographers if we may judge from the strong dislike
which she displayed for Gladstone from 1879 on and which the biographers attribute
simply to the baleful influence of Disraeli. Is it really necessary to point out that


3. Next, as to the nature and role of the cabinet. 18 It is a curiously
double-faced thing, the joint product of Parliament and Prime Minister.
The latter designates its members for appointment, as we have seen, and
the former accepts but also influences his choice. Looked at from the
party’s standpoint it is an assemblage of subleaders more or less
reflecting its own structure. Looked at from the Prime Minister’s
standpoint it is an assemblage not only of comrades in arms but of party
men who have their own interests and prospects to consider—a miniature
Parliament. For the combination to come about and to work it is
necessary for prospective cabinet ministers to make up their minds—not
necessarily from enthusiastic love—to serve under Mr. X and for Mr. X
to shape his program so that his colleagues in the cabinet will not too
often feel like “reconsidering their position,” as official phraseology has
it, or like going on a sitdown strike. Thus the cabinet—and the same
applies to the wider ministry that comprises also the political officers not
in the cabinet—has a distinct function in the democratic process as
against Prime Minister, party, Parliament and electorate. This function of
intermediate leadership is associated with, but by no means based upon,
the current business transacted by the individual cabinet officers in the
several departments to which they are appointed in order to keep the
leading group’s hands on the bureaucratic engine. And it has only a
distant relation, if any, with “seeing to it that the will of the people is
carried out in each of them.” Precisely in the best instances, the people
are presented with results they never thought of and would not have
approved of in advance.

4. Again, as to Parliament. I have both defined what seems to me to
be its primary function and qualified that definition. But it might be
objected that my definition fails to do justice to its other functions.
Parliament obviously does a lot of other things besides setting up and
professions of deference may mean two different things? The man who treats his wife
with elaborate courtliness is not as a rule the one to accept comradeship between the
sexes on terms of equality. As a matter of fact, the courtly attitude is precisely a method
to evade this.

<!-- 18 Still more than the evolution of the prime minister’s office, that of the cabinet is
blurred by the historical continuity that covers changes in the nature of an institution.
To this day the English cabinet is legally the operative part of the Privy Council, which
of course was an instrument of government in decidedly pre-democratic times. But below
this surface an entirely different organ has evolved. As soon as we realize this we find
the task of dating its emergence somewhat easier than we found the analogous task in
the case of the prime minister. Though embryonic cabinets existed in the time of Charles
II (the “cabal” ministry was one, and the committee of four that was formed in connection
with Temple’s experiment was another), the Whig “junto” under William III is a fair
candidate for first place. From the reign of Anne on only minor points of membership
or functioning remain to disagree on. -->

pulling down governments. It legislates. And it even administers. For
although every act of a parliament, except resolutions and declarations
of policy, makes “law” in a formal sense, there are many acts which must
be considered as administrative measures. The budget is the most
important instance. To make it is an administrative function. Yet in this
country it is drawn up by Congress. Even where it is drawn up by the
minister of finance with the approval of the cabinet, as it is in England,
Parliament has to vote on it and by this vote it becomes an act of
Parliament. Does not this refute our theory?

When two armies operate against each other, their individual moves are
always centered upon particular objects that are determined by their
strategical or tactical situations. They may contend for a particular stretch
of country or for a particular hill. But the desirability of conquering that
stretch or hill must be derived from the strategical or tactical purpose, which
is to beat the enemy. It would be obviously absurd to attempt to derive it
from any extra-military properties the stretch or hill may have. Similarly, the
first and foremost aim of each political party is to prevail over the others in
order to get into power or to stay in it. Like the conquest of the stretch of
country or the hill, the decision of the political issues is, from the standpoint
of the politician, not the end but only the material of parliamentary activity.
Since politicians fire off words instead of bullets and since those words are
unavoidably supplied by the issues under debate, this may not always be as
clear as it is in the military case. But victory over the opponent is
nevertheless the essence of both games. 19

Fundamentally, then, the current production of parliamentary decisions on
national questions is the very method by which Parliament keeps or refuses
to keep a government in power or by which Parliament accepts or refuses
to accept the Prime Minister’s leadership. 20 

<!-- 19 Sometimes politicians do emerge from phraseological mists. To cite an example to which
no objection can be raised on the score of frivolity: no lesser politician than Sir Robert Peel
characterized the nature of his craft when he said after his parliamentary victory over the Whig
government on the issue of the latter’s policy in Jamaica: “Jamaica was a good horse to start.”
The reader should ponder over this.

20 This of course applies to the pre-Vichy French and pre-Fascist Italian practice just as
much as to the English practice. It may however be called in question in the case of the United
States where defeat of the administration on a major issue does not entail resignation of the
President. But this is merely due to the fact that the Constitution, which embodies a different
political theory, did not permit parliamentary practice to develop according to its logic. In actual
fact this logic did not entirely fail to assert itself. Defeats on major issues, though they cannot
displace the President, will in general so weaken his prestige as to oust him from a position of
leadership. For the time being this creates an abnormal situation. But whether he wins or loses
the subsequent presidential election, the conflict is then settled in a way that does not
fundamentally differ from the way in which an English Prime Minister deals with a similar
situation when he dissolves Parliament.
 -->


With the exceptions to be noticed presently, every vote is a vote of confidence or want of confidence, and the
votes that are technically so called merely bring out in abstracto the essential
element that is common to all. Of this we can satisfy ourselves by observing
that the initiative in bringing up matters for parliamentary decision as a rule
lies with the government or else with the opposition’s shadow cabinet and
not with private members.

The Prime Minister selects from the incessant stream of current
problems those which he is going to make parliamentary issues, that is to say,
those on which his government proposes to introduce bills or, if he is not sure
of his ground, at least resolutions. Of course every government receives from
its predecessor a legacy of open questions which it may be unable to shelve;
others are taken up as a matter of routine politics; it is only in the case of the
most brilliant achievement that a Prime Minister is in a position to impose
measures about a political issue which he has created himself. In any case
however the government’s choice or lead, whether free or not, is the factor that
dominates parliamentary activity. If a bill is brought in by the opposition, this
means that it is offering battle: such a move is an attack which the government
must either thwart by purloining the issue or else defeat. If a major bill that is
not on the governmental menu is brought in by a group of the governmental
party, this spells revolt and it is from this angle and not from the extra-tactical
merits of the case that it is looked upon by the ministers. This even extends
to the raising of a debate. Unless suggested or sanctioned by the government,
these are symptoms of the government forces’ getting out of hand. Finally, if
a measure is carried by inter-party agreement, this means a drawn battle or a
battle avoided on strategical grounds.21

5. The exceptions to this principle of governmental leadership in
“representative” assemblies only serve to show how realistic it is. They are
of two kinds.

First, no leadership is absolute. 

<!-- 21 Another highly significant piece of English technique may be mentioned in this
connection. A major bill is or was usually not proceeded with if the majority for it fell to a
very low figure on the second reading. This practice first of all recognized an important
limitation of the majority principle as actually applied in well-managed democracies: it would
not be correct to say that in a democracy the minority is always compelled to surrender. But
there is a second point. While the minority is not always compelled to yield to the majority
on the particular issue under debate, it is practically always—there were exceptions even to
this—compelled to yield to it on the question whether the cabinet is to stay in power. Such
a vote on the second reading of a major government measure may be said to combine a vote
of confidence with a vote for shelving a bill. If the contents of the bill were all that mattered
there would hardly be any sense in voting for it if it is not to make the statute book. But if
Parliament is primarily concerned with keeping the cabinet in office, then such tactics become
at once understandable. -->

Political leadership exerted according to the
democratic method is even less so than are others because of that competitive element which is of the essence of democracy. Since theoretically every follower has the right of displacing his leader and since there are nearly always some
followers who have a real chance of doing so, the private member and—if he
feels that he could do with a bigger hat—the minister within and without the
inner circle steers a middle course between an unconditional allegiance to the
leader’s standard and an unconditional raising of a standard of his own,
balancing risks and chances with a nicety that is sometimes truly admirable.22

The leader in turn responds by steering a middle course between insisting on
discipline and allowing himself to be thwarted. He tempers pressure with more
or less judicious concessions, frowns with compliments, punishments with
benefits. This game results, according to the relative strength of individuals and
their positions, in a very variable but in most cases considerable amount of
freedom. In particular, groups that are strong enough to make their resentment
felt yet not strong enough to make it profitable to include their protagonists and
their programs in the governmental arrangement will in general be allowed to
have their way in minor questions or, at any rate, in questions which the Prime
Minister can be induced to consider as of minor or only sectional importance.
Thus, groups of followers or even individual members may occasionally have
the opportunity of carrying bills of their own and still more indulgence will of
course be extended to mere criticism or to failure to vote mechanically for every
government measure. But we need only look at this in a practical spirit in order
to realize, from the limits that are set to the use of this freedom, that it embodies
not the principle of the working of a parliament but deviations from it.
Second, there are cases in which the political engine fails to absorb certain
issues either because the high commands of the government’s and the
opposition’s forces do not appreciate their political values or because these
values are in fact doubtful.23 Such issues may then be taken up by outsiders
who prefer making an independent bid for power to serving in the ranks of
one of the existing parties. This of course is perfectly normal politics. But there
is another possibility. A man may feel so strongly about a particular question
that he may enter the political arena merely in order to have it solved in his
way and without harboring any wish to start in on a normal political career.

<!-- 22 One of the most instructive examples by which the above can be illustrated is afforded
by the course taken by Joseph Chamberlain with respect to the Irish question in the 1880’s.
He finally outmaneuvered Gladstone, but he started the campaign while officially an ardent
adherent. And the case is exceptional only in the force and brilliance of the man. As every
political captain knows, only mediocrities can be counted on for loyalty. That is why some of
the greatest of those captains, Disraeli for instance, surrounded themselves by thoroughly
second-rate men.

23 An issue that has never been tried out is the typical instance of the first class. The typical
reasons why a government and the shadow cabinet of the opposition may tacitly agree to leave
an issue alone in spite of their realizing its potentialities are technical difficulty of handling it
and the fear that it will cause sectional difficulties.
 -->
This however is so unusual that it is difficult to find instances of first-rank
importance of it. Perhaps Richard Cobden was one. It is true that instances
of second-rank importance are more frequent, especially instances of the
crusader type. But nobody will hold that they are anything but deviations
from standard practice.

We may sum up as follows. In observing human societies we do not as
a rule find it difficult to specify, at least in a rough commonsense manner,
the various ends that the societies under study struggle to attain. These ends
may be said to provide the rationale or meaning of corresponding
individual activities. But it does not follow that the social meaning of a
type of activity will necessarily provide the motive power, hence the
explanation of the latter. 

If it does not, a theory that contents itself with
an analysis of the social end or need to be served cannot be accepted as
an adequate account of the activities that serve it. For instance, the reason
why there is such a thing as economic activity is of course that people want
to eat, to clothe themselves and so on. To provide the means to satisfy
those wants is the social end or meaning of production. Nevertheless we
all agree that this proposition would make a most unrealistic starting point
for a theory of economic activity in commercial society and that we shall
do much better if we start from propositions about profits. Similarly, the
social meaning or function of parliamentary activity is no doubt to turn out
legislation and, in part, administrative measures. But in order to understand
how democratic politics serve this social end, we must start from the
competitive struggle for power and office and realize that the social
function is fulfilled, as it were, incidentally—in the same sense as
production is incidental to the making of profits.

6. Finally, as to the role of the electorate, only one additional point need
be mentioned. We have seen that the wishes of the members of a parliament
are not the ultimate data of the process that produces government. A similar
statement must be made concerning the electorate. Its choice—ideologically
glorified into the Call from the People—does not flow from its initiative but
is being shaped, and the shaping of it is an essential part of the democratic
process. Voters do not decide issues. But neither do they pick their members
of parliament from the eligible population with a perfectly open mind. In all
normal cases the initiative lies with the candidate who makes a bid for the
office of member of parliament and such local leadership as that may imply.
Voters confine themselves to accepting this bid in preference to others or
refusing to accept it. Even most of those exceptional cases in which a man
is genuinely drafted by the electors come into the same category for either
of two reasons: naturally a man need not bid for leadership if he has acquired
leadership already; or it may happen that a local leader who can control or
Another Theory of Democracy 283

influence the vote but is unable or unwilling to compete for election himself
designates another man who then may seem to have been sought out by the
voters acting on their own initiative.

But even as much of electoral initiative as acceptance of one of the
competing candidates would in itself imply is further restricted by the
existence of parties. A party is not, as classical doctrine (or Edmund Burke)
would have us believe, a group of men who intend to promote public welfare
“upon some principle on which they are all agreed.” This rationalization is
so dangerous because it is so tempting. For all parties will of course, at any
given time, provide themselves with a stock of principles or planks and these
principles or planks may be as characteristic of the party that adopts them
and as important for its success as the brands of goods a department store
sells are characteristic of it and important for its success. But the department
store cannot be defined in terms of its brands and a party cannot be defined
in terms of its principles. 

A party is a group whose members propose to act
in concert in the competitive struggle for political power. If that were not
so it would be impossible for different parties to adopt exactly or almost
exactly the same program. Yet this happens as everyone knows. Party and
machine politicians are simply the response to the fact that the electoral mass
is incapable of action other than a stampede, and they constitute an attempt
to regulate political competition exactly similar to the corresponding
practices of a trade association. The psycho-technics of party management
and party advertising, slogans and marching tunes, are not accessories. They
are of the essence of politics. So is the political boss.
