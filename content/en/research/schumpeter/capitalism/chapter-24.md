<!-- PART V
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties -->

## PROLOGUE

<!-- IT IS not for me to write a history of the socialist parties. Both the settings
in which they rose and fell and the ways in which they grappled with their
problems call for a larger canvas and a mightier brush than mine. Also, the
time has not yet come to make the attempt: though the last twenty years have
brought up many valuable monographs that shed all the light we need on
particular situations or phases,  -->

A vast amount of research has still to be done before a history of modern socialism in action can be written that will meet the requirements of scholarship. 

<!-- But certain facts are necessary in order to
complement and to put into the proper perspective much of what has been
said in the preceding parts of this book. And some other points that have
occurred to me from study or personal observation1 I wish to present because
they seem to be interesting on their own account. For this double purpose I
have assembled the fragments that are to follow, in the hope that even
fragments may indicate the contours of the whole. -->

Not every reader—not even every socialist reader—will approve of the central
position this fragment gives to Marx and Marxism. 

I have a personal bias here.

in the matter. For me, the fascinating thing about 

Socialist policy gets its special intellectual and moral dignity is its clear and close relation to a doctrinal basis. 

It is theory implemented by action or inaction turning on the
true or false perception of a historical necessity. (See Part I.) Even considerations
of expediency and mere tactics carry that character indelebilis and always have
been discussed in the light of that principle. But all this is true only of the
Marxian streak; no truer, of course, than it is, within the bourgeois compound,
of the Benthamite radicals—the “philosophical” radicals as they were
significantly called. 

All non-Marxian socialist groups are more or less like other
groups and parties; only Marxists of pure persuasion consistently walked in the
light of a doctrine that to them contained all answers to all questions. As will
be seen, I do not admire this attitude unconditionally. It may well be called
narrow and even naïve. But the doctrinaires of all types, whatever their practical
disabilities, have certain esthetic qualities that raise them high above the common
run of political practitioners. Also they command sources of strength which mere
practitioners will never be able to understand.
<!-- 1 One of these points has been dealt with elsewhere. See ch. xx. -->

## THE NONAGE

SOCIALIST doctrines, in some of their roots presumably as old as
articulate thought, were dreams, beautiful or hateful—impotent longings
out of contact with social realities—so long as they lacked the means to
convince anybody that the social process worked for the realization of
socialism. Socialist effort amounted to preaching in the desert so long as it had
no established contact with an existing or potential source of social power—
to preaching of the Platonic type about which no politician need bother and
which no observer of social processes need list among operative factors.
This is the gist of Marx’s criticism of most of the socialists who preceded
him or in his day offered competitive teaching, and the reason why he called
them Utopian. The point was not so much that many of their schemes were
obviously freaks or otherwise below par intellectually, but that those schemes
were essentially unimplemented and unimplementable. 

A few examples will
illustrate this and will stand instead of a survey of a large body of literature.
Also they will suffice to show how far Marx’s judgment was wrong.

Sir Thomas More’s (1478–1535) Utopia, read, admired and even
copied right into the nineteenth century—witness the success of Cabet
and of Bellamy—unfolds the picture of a frugal, moral and equalitarian
society that was the exact opposite of English society in More’s day. This
ideal may be but the literary form of social criticism. Perhaps we need
not accept it for a presentation of More’s opinion about the aims of
practical social planning. However, if it be understood in the latter
sense—and so it was—the trouble with it does not lie in its
impracticability. 

In some respects it is less impracticable than are certain
present-day forms of idyllic socialism. For instance, it faces the question
of authority and it frankly accepts the prospect—exalted no doubt into a
virtue—of a modest standard of life. The real trouble is that there is no
attempt to show how society is to evolve toward that ideal state (except
possibly by conversion) or what the real factors are that might be worked
upon in order to produce it. We can like or dislike the ideal. But we
cannot do much about it. To put the practical dot on the i, there is nothing
in it on which to found a party and to provide a program.
Another type may be instanced by Robert Owen’s (1771–1858) socialism.

A manufacturer and practical reformer, he was not content to conceive—or adopt—the idea of small self-sufficing communities, producing and
consuming their means of livelihood according to communist principles in
the word’s boldest acceptance. He actually went about realizing it. 

First he
hoped for government action, then he tried the effect of setting an example.

So it might seem that the plan was more operational than More’s: there was
not only an ideal but also a bridge leading to it. Actually however that kind
of bridge only serves to illustrate more precisely the nature of utopianism.
For both government action and individual efforts are introduced as dei ex
machina—the thing would have had to be done just because some agent
thought it worth while. No social force working toward the goal was
indicated or could have been indicated. No soil was provided for the rose
trees—they were left to feed on beauty. 1

The same applies to Proudhon’s (1809–1865) anarchism.

But in his case, definite economic error is much more in evidence than it is with
most of the other classics of anarchism who despised economic argument
and, whether stressing the ideal of free and stateless cooperation of
individuals or the task of destruction to be accomplished in order to make
way for it, avoided errors of reasoning largely by avoiding reasoning. 

Like “poet, lunatic and lover of imagination all compact,” they were
constitutionally unable to do anything except to upset socialist applecarts and
to add to confusion in situations of revolutionary excitement. It is not
difficult to sympathize with Marx’s disgust, that sometimes was not unmixed
with despair, at the doings of M.Bakunin.

But anarchism was utopianism with a vengeance. 

The pathological species has been mentioned only in order to make it quite clear that such revivals
of fourteenth-century mentality should not be confused with the genuine
brand of Utopian socialism which St. Simon’s (1760–1825) writings display
at its best. There we find sense and responsibility coupled with considerable
analytic power. The goal envisaged was not absurd or visionary. What was
lacking was the way: again the only method suggested was government
action—action by governments that at the time were essentially bourgeois.
If this view be accepted, the great break that put an end to the nonage of
socialism must in fact be associated with the name and work of Karl Marx.

<!-- 1 The same is true of the similar plan of Charles Fourier (1772–1837) which will not
however be called socialist by everyone, since labor was to receive only 5/12 of the social
product, the rest going to capital and management. Though in itself this was a meritorious
attempt to take account of realities, it is amusing to note that labor would in that ideal state of
things have done worse than it actually does in capitalist society. In prewar England for instance
(see A.Bowley, The Division of the Product of Industry, 1921, p. 37), wages and salaries under
£160 absorbed, in manufacturing and mining, 62 per cent of the value of net output or, counting
in salaries above £160, 68 per cent. Of course Fourier’s ideals were not primarily economic,
but as far as they were, they illustrate well how large an element of ignorance about capitalist
facts enters into reformist creeds -->

We may then date it, so far as in such matters dating is possible at all, by
the issue of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) or by the
foundation of the First International (1864): it was in that period that both
the doctrinal and the political criteria of seriousness were met. But, on the
one hand, this achievement only summed up the developments of the
centuries of nonage and, on the other hand, it formulated them in a particular
way that perhaps was practically, but certainly was not logically, the only
possible one.
