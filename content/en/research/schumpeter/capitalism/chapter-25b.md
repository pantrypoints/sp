In any case however, Marx and Engels, circumstanced as they were and
being the types they were, could never have thought of going forth in order
to organize the industrial proletariat, or any particular group of it, according
to ideas of their own. All they could hope for was contact with leaders and
with the union bureaucracy. Beholding, on the one hand, that attitude of the
“respectable” workman and, on the other hand, the attitude of the (then)
unorganizable mob of the big cities with which they hardly wished to act, 4
they faced a disagreeable dilemma. They could not fail to recognize the
importance of the trade-union movement that was about to accomplish, step by step, the gigantic task of organizing the masses into something like an
articulate class, that is to say, to solve the problem which they themselves
felt to be the most important of all. But, being completely out of it and
realizing the danger that this class might acquire bourgeois standing and
adopt a bourgeois attitude, they were bound to dislike and to distrust the
trade unions as much as they were disliked and distrusted—as far as they
were noticed at all—by them. They were thus driven back upon the position
that has become characteristic of classical socialism and that, though much
reduced in importance, to this day expresses the fundamental antagonism
between the socialist intellectuals and labor (which may in important cases
be roughly equated to the antagonism between socialist parties and trade
unions). For them, the trade-union movement was something to be converted
to the doctrine of class war; as a means of such conversion, occasional
cooperation with it was proper for the faithful whenever labor troubles
radicalized the masses and sufficiently worried or excited trade-union
officials to induce them to listen to the gospel. But so long as conversion
was not complete and in particular so long as trade-union opinion remained
on principle averse to revolutionary or simply to political action, the
movement was not in a state of grace but on the contrary in error,
misconceiving its own true ends, deluding itself with trivialities that were
worse than futile; hence, except for the purpose of boring from within, the
faithful had to keep aloof.

This situation changed even during Marx’s and still more during Engels’
lifetime. The growth of the industrial proletariat that eventually made it a
power also on the Continent and the unemployment incident to the
depressions of that period increased their influence with labor leaders though
they never acquired any direct influence on the masses. To the end however
it was mainly the intellectuals that supplied them the material to work with.

But though their success in that quarter was considerable, the intellectuals
gave them still more trouble than did the indifference, occasionally
amounting to hostility, of the labor men. There was a fringe of socialist
intellectuals that had no objection to identifying themselves either with the
trade unions or with social reform of the bourgeois-radical or even the
conservative type. And these of course dispensed a very different socialism
which, holding out the promise of immediate benefit, was a dangerous
competitor. There were moreover intellectuals, foremost among them
Lassalle, who had conquered positions among the masses that were still more
directly competitive. And finally there were intellectuals who went far
enough as regards revolutionary ardor, but whom Marx and Engels quite
rightly looked upon as the worst enemies of serious socialism—the
“putschists” like Blanqui, the dreamers, the anarchists and so on. 

Doctrinal as well as tactical considerations rendered it imperative to meet all of these
groups with an unflinching No.

3. That doctrinal background and that tactical situation made it extremely difficult for Marx to find answers for two vital questions which every
follower or would-be follower was sure to ask: the question of the attitude
toward the policies of the bourgeois parties and the question of the
immediate program.

As regards the first, socialist parties could not be advised to watch
bourgeois politics in silence. Their obvious task was to criticize capitalist
society, to expose the masquerade of class interests, to point out how much
better everything would be in the socialist paradise and to beat up for
recruits: to criticize and to organize. However, a wholly negative attitude,
though quite satisfactory as a principle, would have been impossible for any
party of more than negligible political importance to keep up. It would
inevitably have collided with most of the real desiderata of organized labor
and, if persisted in for any length of time, would have reduced the followers
to a small group of political ascetics. Considering the influence that Marx’s
teaching exerted, right up to 1914, on the great German party and on many
smaller groups it is interesting to see how he dealt with this difficulty.


So far as he felt it possible to do so, he took the only position that was
logically unimpeachable. Socialists must refuse to participate in the sham
improvements by which the bourgeoisie tried to deceive the proletariat. Such
participation—later dubbed Reformism—spelled lapse from the Faith, betrayal
of the true aims, an insidious attempt to patch up what should be destroyed.
Disciples like Bebel who made the pilgrimage to the shrine after having thus
strayed from the right path were soundly rated. It is true that Marx and Engels
themselves had at the time of their communist party of 1847 contemplated
cooperation with left-wing bourgeois groups. Also, the Communist Manifesto
recognized the necessity of occasional compromises and alliances, just as it
allowed that tactics would have to differ according to the circumstances of time
and place. So much was implied in the maxim enjoined upon the faithful to
make use of all the antagonisms between the bourgeoisies of different countries
and between bourgeois groups within every country—for this can hardly be
done without a measure of cooperation with some of them. But all that only
amounted to qualifying a principle in order to uphold it the more effectively.
In each case, the exception had to be severely scrutinized, the presumption
being always against it. Moreover, it was cooperation in certain definite
emergencies, preferably revolutions, that was envisaged rather than more
durable alliance involving understandings in the ordinary run of political life
which might endanger the purity of the creed.

How Marxists should behave when confronted by a particular policy of the bourgeois enemy that clearly benefits the proletariat, we may infer from
the example set by the master himself in a very important instance. Free trade
was one of the main planks in the platform of English liberalism. Marx was
far too good an economist not to see what boon, in the circumstances of that
time, it conferred upon the working class. The boon might be belittled, the
motives of bourgeois free traders might be reviled. But that did not solve the
problem, for surely socialists would have to support free trade, particularly
in foodstuffs. Well, so they should but not of course because cheap bread
was a boon—oh, no!—but because free trade would quicken the pace of
social evolution, hence the advent of the social revolution. The tactical trick
is admirable. The argument is moreover quite true and admits of application
to a great many cases. The oracle did not say however what socialists should
do about policies which, while also benefiting the proletariat, do not promote
capitalist evolution—such as most measures of social betterment, social
insurance and the like—or which, while promoting capitalist evolution, do
not directly benefit the proletariat. But if the bourgeois camp should split
upon such questions the road was clear by virtue of the precept to make use
of capitalist dissensions. From this angle Marx would also have dealt with
reforms sponsored, in opposition to the bourgeoisie by extra-bourgeois
elements such as the landed aristocracy and gentry although, in his schema
of things, there was no separate place for this phenomenon.

The second question was no less thorny. No party can live without a
program that holds out the promise of immediate benefits. But in strict logic
Marxism had no such program to offer. Anything positive done or to be done
in the vitiated atmosphere of capitalism was ipso facto tainted. Marx and
Engels were in fact worrying about this and always discouraged programs
that involved constructive policy within the capitalist order and inevitably
savored of bourgeois radicalism. However, when they themselves faced the
problem in 1847, they resolutely cut the Gordian knot. The Communist
Manifesto quite illogically lists a number of immediate objects of socialist
policy, simply laying the socialist barge alongside the liberal liner.

Free education, universal suffrage, suppression of child labor, a
progressive income tax, nationalization of land, banking and transportation,
expansion of state enterprise, reclamation of waste lands, compulsory
industrial service for all, the spreading out of industrial centers over the
country—all this clearly measures the extent to which (at that time) Marx
and Engels allowed themselves to be opportunist though they were inclined
to deny the privilege to other socialists. For the striking thing about this
program is the absence of any plank that we should recognize as typically
or exclusively socialist if we met it in another entourage; any single one of
them could figure in a non-socialist program—even the nationalization of land has been advocated, on special grounds, by otherwise bourgeois
writers—and most of them are simply taken from the radical stockpot. This
was of course the only sensible thing to do. But all the same it was a mere
makeshift, obviously intended to serve no other purpose than that of covering
an embarrassing practical weakness. Had Marx been interested in those items
for their own sake, he would have had no alternative but to coalesce with
the radical wing of bourgeois liberalism. As it was, they mattered little to
him and he felt no obligation to make any sacrifice for their sake; had the
bourgeois radicals carried them all, this would presumably have come to
Marx as a very disagreeable surprise.


4. The same principles, the same tactics and similar political data
produced the Inaugural Address to the International Workmen’s Association
(the “First International”) in 1864. The foundation of the latter meant indeed
a great stride beyond the German Arbeiterbildungsverein of 1847 or the little
international group of the same year. 

It was of course no organization of
socialist parties—though for instance the two German ones joined, the
Lassallean Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein speedily resigned—and still
less an international organization of the proletariat. But labor groups from
many lands and of many types were actually represented and even English
trade unions showed interest enough to bear for a time, in a rather
noncommittal way and with an eye to possible immediate advantages, with
a somewhat uncongenial alliance. George Odger figured among the
founders. 5 The large claims made by the Association and some of its
historians concerning its role in the revolutionary movements and the major
labor troubles of the time will bear discounting. 

But if it effected little and
never led or controlled, it at least offered unifying phraseology. And it
established contacts that in the end might have raised it, with the kind
assistance of its bourgeois enemies who were foolish enough to advertise for
it, to a position of real importance. In the beginning all went fairly well and
the first four “congresses” were distinctly successful, certain unsocialist
incidents, such as the vote upholding the principle of inheritance, being
tactfully overlooked by the orthodox members. Bakunin’s invasion (1869)
and expulsion (1872) however dealt a blow from which the Association
proved unable to recover though it lingered on till 1874.

<!-- 5 He even acted as president of the International’s council. That meant a lot, since he had
been one of the most prominent promoters of federation and amalgamation among trade unions,
an organizer of the London Trade Council and a leading officer of the reform league for the
enfranchisement of urban workers. -->


Marx was from the first aware of the possibilities and of the dangers
inherent in that caravanserai which held intellectuals of doubtful standing
alongside of labor men obviously determined to use the Association or to disown it according to circumstances. They were the possibilities for
which, and the dangers against which, he had always fought. 

The first task
was to keep the organization together, the second to impart to it the
Marxian slant, both to be solved in the face of the facts, that his personal
followers were always a minority and that his influence on the other
members was much smaller than might be inferred from his being
drafted—or rather allowed—to make the program address. In consequence,
this address contained concessions to un Marxian views similar to those
which Marx himself was shocked to find in the Gotha program of the
German Social Democratic party (1875). Similarly, judicious maneuvering
and compromise were much in evidence ever after—the sort of thing that
once made Marx exclaim in semi-humorous despair: “Je ne suis pas
Marxiste.” But the meaning of compromise depends upon the man by
whom, and the spirit in which, it is made. He who cares only for the trend
may put up with many deviations. Evidently Marx trusted himelf to keep
his trend steadily in view and to find his way back to it after each
deviation. But we shall understand that he felt misgivings when he saw
others playing the same game. There was thus more than mere egotism
both in his tactical shuffling and in his venomous denunciations of other
people’s shuffling.

Both the tactics and the principle of what has ever since
remained the classical policy of orthodox socialism are open to criticism. The
tactical example set by Marx left followers free to justify practically any
course of action or inaction by some move or dictum of the master. The
principle has been denounced for pointing a way that led nowhere. All the
more important is it to realize its rationale. Marx believed in the proletarian
revolution. He also believed—though his own doctrine should have made
him doubt this—that the right moment for it was not far off, just as most
early Christians believed that the day of judgment was at hand. Therefore,
his political method was indeed founded upon an error of diagnosis. Those
intellectuals who extol his political acumen 6 fail entirely to see the amount
of wishful thinking that entered into his practical judgment. But the facts
within his horizon and his inferences from them being taken for granted, that
method does follow as do his views on the subject of immediate results and
on the table fellowship with bourgeois reformers. To found a homogeneous
party based upon the organized proletariat of all countries that would march
toward the goal without losing its revolutionary faith and getting its powder
wet on the road was from that standpoint indeed the task of paramount
importance compared with which everything else was nugatory.
