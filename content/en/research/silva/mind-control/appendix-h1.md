APPENDIX HI

INTRODUCTION

J. W. Hahn, Ph.D., Director of Research Silva Mind Control International

Until recently, scientists have been extremely critical of reports claiming that Yogis have learned to deliberately
regulate their heartbeat, body temperature, and other internal body processes normally considered to be of an in-
voluntary nature. Largely ignored also were reports that some subjects in deep states of hypnosis (an altered state
of consciousness) could by suggestion be made to effect changes of a physiological nature normally considered not
to be under voluntary control: for example, the raising of blisters and control of heart rate.
With the introduction of (bio) feedback techniques, the scientist has come to recognize during the last several years
that almost any internal body process can be brought under control. 

Biofeedback techniques are based on the principle that we learn to respond correctly if we are immediately informed (feedback) of the correctness of the response
or how close we are to responding correctly.

Using rewards as a feedback device in animals, psychologist Dr. Neal Miller, currently of Rockefeller Univer-
sity, demonstrated that heart-rate changes could be achieved by voluntary control. Dr. Elmer Green, at the Menninger
Foundation, showed that by using biofeedback, humans could learn to differentially control the temperature of their
hands—either hand hot, the other cold.


In the wake of brain-wave biofeedback experiments of Dr. Kamiya, of the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric In-
stitute, researchers have shown that these methods are effective in teaching individuals to control their brain-wave
Alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) voluntarily.

Other less laboratory-oriented techniques have also been used to control internal body organs. For instance, the
technique of transcendental meditation attempts to produce s relaxation of internal organs including the brain.
Another system by which subjects can produce relaxation and control of brain waves is Silva Mind Control.
Persons who have taken the Silva Mind Control courses report a sensation of deep relaxation and a belief that they
can control their brain waves. 

These claims were tested in 1971 by Dr. F. J. Bremner, psychologist at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. 

It appeared that people trained in this way can indeed control their brain waves and produce Alpha rhythm when they choose to do so.
This was determined in a study in Which a group of 20 Entrained students volunteered for an experiment in brain-
wave control. Half of the students were conditioned by a method similar to Pavlov's method of conditioning dogs.
That is, when the subjects heard a click it signaled that a robe light would elicit an Alpha frequency response in
the EEG. Soon the click also elicited the Alpha frequency pattern in the subjects' EEG readout.

The other ten subjects were trained by Mr. Silva with the Mind Control method. Both groups showed EEG
changes in the direction predicted: that is, both groups increased the percentage of Alpha frequency in their
EEG's.

At a later time a second experiment was done using subjects with considerable practice in the Silva method. These
subjects could start and stop Alpha frequency responses at will and could carry on a conversation while generating
Alpha rhythm. One further test was made on these more practiced subjects. Since these subjects had also had con-
siderable experience in ESP exercises (case working), EEG's were recorded while they engaged in ESP exercises.214 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
These EEG patterns also showed a high incidence of Alpha frequency.

It seems from these studies that with training, man can exercise a good deal of voluntary control over his internal
organs. This holds true for the brain if we accept the electrical responses of that organ as being an indicator of its
function. It also suggests that much more research is needed to determine the correlates of the physiological and
mental-emotional states and the training procedures required to make the most of voluntary psycho-physiological
self-regulation.

A better understanding of the significance of Silva Mind Control training may be emerging from research on the
physiology of the brain, as reported by neurobiologist Dr. Rodger W. Sperry and his colleagues in Los Angeles. These
and other scientists have developed laboratory and clinical evidence for the existence of two distinct kinds of con-
sciousness functioning separately but simultaneously within the brains of humans. The one kind of consciousness deals
with sequential, logic-dependent thinking activities such as mathematics and speech. 

It is functionally a product of the left hemisphere of the cortex. The other kind is associated
with the right hemisphere and accounts for holistic and
spontaneously creative, intuitive thinking, with an appre-
ciation for spatiality and music.

The left-hemisphere consciousness dominates most of our everyday living and is favored even by the educational
system as well as by the societal attitudes of the Western world. It is objectively oriented, and usually associated
with the generation of much Beta brain-wave activity. 

Right-hemisphere consciousness seems to be primarily subjective, receives secondary consideration in our education,
and finds its greatest expression in the arts. It is generally accompanied by Alpha or Theta brain-wave emanation.
Silva Mind Control trains individuals to maintain speech and other Beta thinking activities at Alpha as well as in-
dulge in Alpha thinking processes of a creative, intuitive nature as part of a deliberate undertaking to provide for
more equal distribution of function between left and right hemispheres.

It helps balance an otherwise unequal preoccupation with left-hemisphere function when undertaking
to solve problems. It would seem to accomplish a more effective use of brain potential through the encouragement
of deliberate right-hemisphere function. 

EEG CORRELATES OF ATTENTION IN HUMANS*

Frederick J. Bremner, V. Benignus, and F. M or its, Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas
This study was supported by the Mind Science Foundation, Los Angeles, California. 

The authors express their appreciation to Mr. Jose Silva for his participation in the experiment and to David L. Carlson for his help in preparing the manuscript.

An attention model has been presented by Bremner and his co-workers which makes use of EEG changes as a
dependent variable (Bremner, 1970; Ford, Morris, and Bremner, 1968; Eddy, Bremner, and Thomas, 1971; Hurwitz and Bremner, 1972). This model considers that there
are different classes or subsets of attention but that, while these subsets are orthogonal, they are not arranged in a
hierarchy. The subsets already defined are: expectancy, counter-expectancy, orientation, arousal, and non-focus
(Hurwitz and Bremner, 1972).

The utility of the above model will increase as its generality increases. The present study attempts to extend the
generality of the model from the animal data used for its original conception to data concerning human attentional
states. The present study concentrated on two aspects of generalizing the model. One of these aspects was to see if
human EEG was sensitive to changes relative to any of the * " E E G Correlate* of Attention in H u m a n e " h a t t l n c e been p u b -
lished in Nruroptychologia, Vol. 10, 1072, pp. 307-12.216 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
previously proposed subsets. The other aspect was to determine if there was any unique attentional subset present in
humans but either not present in animals or not testable in animals.

Because much of the experimentation used to test the model has been directed toward the expectancy subset, this
was the subset chosen to test human attention. The reader is reminded that expectancy is used here to mean that the
subjects (Ss) have learned a relationship that stimulus B follows stimulus A.
Since the details of the procedure will be elaborated in the method section, suffice it to say that this will be done
by means of a classical conditioning paradigm. This paradigm followed as closely as possible that used to gather the
animal data. The animal data, however, capitalized on the ready availability of Theta rhythm. Human EEG data on
the other hand are characterized by high probability of Alpha rhythm. Therefore Alpha rhythm was used as data
for the dependent variable. The second aspect of this study may well be the more mteresting. Psychologists have often
debated the existence of a human inner consciousness. The present model addresses itself to this question by making
internal focus a subset of attention. The internal-focus subset is characterized by the absence of exteroceptive stimulus
and by being testable only in the human. It is proposed that this subset can be measured by EEG changes that occur
following Ss responses during meditational and deep relaxation states.

METHOD

Subjects: The Ss were 20 volunteer male college students from an introductory psychology class, ranging in age from
eighteen to twenty-five. They were told that the experiment was about self-control of brain waves, and were assigned
irregularly to two groups of 10 Ss each. 

Apparatus: A Beckman Type T electroencephalograph was used. 

Electrodes were stainless steel, attached subcutaneously over the vertex and occipital area. EEG data were
visually monitored as well as tape recorded. Through an auditory biogenic feedback system, the brain waves in the
Alpha range (8-13 Hz) could be filtered from the occipital EEG and presented to the S through earphones as an
analog of the Alpha frequency. A Digital Equipment Corporation logic programmer was arranged to indicate a
binary number, turn on a half-second CS, and 10 seconds later to turn on a 10-second UCS. The CS was a click delivered to the earphones worn by the subject, and consisted of the opening and closing of a relay connected to a six-volt battery. The UCS was a Grass PS 2 Photostimulator strobe light set at the S's eyes-closed Alpha frequency. All data were recorded on an 8-track Ampex Sp 300 Analog tape deck, and the completed analog tape was digitized by an A-D converter connected to an IBM 360/44 computer before analysis.

Procedure: This experiment was reviewed and approved by a University Committee for Humane Treatment of Humans
as Experimental Subjects. Each S was asked to fill out a protocol sheet asking for such information as last use of
alcohol or drugs, history of epileptic seizures, and previous experience with hypnosis, Yoga, or Alpha conditioning. In
addition, the first time a S was brought into the lab, he was asked to sign a statement consenting to participate in the
experiment and asserting that the nature and purpose of •ht procedure had been explained to him.
A baseline EEG was run on each S, with no feedback provided. The S was given a "close eyes" instruction as a
stimulus. The graph was marked with a binary number, and separate recording channels were used for the unal-
tered and filtered brain waves. 

This procedure was then repeated with an "open eyes" instruction. The S's face was monitored with closed-circuit television, and the total time
in the chamber for the baseline data was approximately 30 minutes for each S. If the baseline reading was inadequate,
*je baseline procedure was repeated until artifact-free data were obtained.218 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
Following the baseline procedure, Ss were divided into two groups of 10 Ss each. One group (Silva) was given a
14-hour weekend session of the Jose Silva Mind Control training course (Shah, 1971). While the Silva "mind con*
trol technique" is unique unto itself, it capitalizes on both deep relaxation and group hypnosis-like procedures. Some
time is also spent in what best can be described as ESP exercises. At the beginning of the following week, die Ss
were brought into the lab, and an EEG was taken for 20 minutes. Recordings were made both with eyes closed and with eyes open, while the Ss were practicing their Silva technique. On another occasion, an EEG was taken on the same Ss, with auditory biogenic feedback under similar instructions.

The second group (CC) of 10 Ss was run through classical conditioning paradigm of SO trials per session.
Each trial consisted of a CS of a half-second click, followed by a 10-second interstimulus interval (ISI), followed
by a UCS consisting of 10 seconds' duration of a strobe light set at the S's eyes-closed Alpha frequency. The inter-
trial interval (JTI) was irregular, with the experimenter starting the trial when S appeared relaxed. No feedback was
provided for this set of trials. A 50-trial session lasted 20 to 30 minutes, and the sessions were repeated until S was
conditioned to produce Alpha, or until the experimenter was convinced S could not produce Alpha sufficiently. The
final 50-trial session was conducted for the CC group with biogenic feedback provided. All classical conditioning data
reported were taken under eyes-open conditions.

TREATMENT OF RESULTS

For purposes of analysis, the EEG data were sampled in terms of epochs, one epoch being 10 consecutive seconds
of data. For the baseline data, one epoch was taken for each S under eyes-closed and one epoch under eyes-open
conditions. For the Silva Ss, after the 14-hour training session, one epoch was taken for eyes-closed, and one epoch
for eyes-open conditions, without feedback. Eyes-closed and  eyes-open epochs were also taken on the Silva group when
feedback was provided. For the CC group, an early trial (trial 3 if it was artifact-free) was taken, and the epoch
was the 10-second ISI. A similar epoch was taken from the last trial before the biogenic feedback, and a final epoch
was taken after the feedback was started. 

Each epoch was A-D converted and spectrally analyzed, yielding the power at various EEG frequencies (Walter,
1968). Only the eyes-open data will be reported in this paper.

RESULTS

Figures I and II (p. 229), summarize the results of the CC group and Silva group respectively. The effect of biogenic
feedback can also be seen in each figure. The three aspects of the experiment were projected on a common axis; thus
a comparison between baseline readings, improvement in Alpha frequency production through either experimental
procedure, and the influence of biogenic feedback can be observed on the figure for each group.

Turning first to the CC group (Figure I), a definite increase in Alpha production due to the CC procedure is
indicated by a peak in the middle line at frequencies 8 to 9 Hz. The baseline data did not appear to indicate a
dominant Alpha rhythm output, as seen by the broad and rather flat spectra. The increase in mean percent power is
distributed among a smaller number of frequencies. 

An additional change in the Alpha band is observed when biogenic feedback is introduced, and this is accompanied
by a further narrowing of the spectra. That is, the introduction of biogenic feedback yielded yet another frequency
shift. 

Similar observations can be made of the Silva group data (Figure II) but caution must be exercised in comparing the figures of the two groups. Observation of the figure, however, indicates that the Silva Ss were quite capable of producing the Alpha rhythm following treatment, although not in the quantity demonstrated by the CC Ss. (See Fig-220 / ure I.) 

Again a downward frequency shift occurred and It appears to be greater here than in the CC group. This con-
clusion may not be entirely correct because the Silva group baseline readings included elevated production of higher
frequencies, such as in the 10 to 12 Hz range, while baseline readings in the CC group did not It is difficult, there-
fore, to make a judgment on the degree of relative shift in the two groups. It is worth noting, however, that the fre-
quency shift occurred in the same direction in both groups and that the biogenic feedback had the same effect in both
cases. (See Figure IL)

DISCUSSION

The data reported above would apparently support the Bremner attention model, particularly the expectancy and
internal-focus subsets. It is rather interesting to compare die human data recorded in this study with animal data
originally used to define the expectancy subset. (See Figure in.) If one compares Figures I and in, a certain
similarity becomes apparent The baseline and CS alone curves are broad and fiat while the conditioning curves are
peaked. Also, both graphs show a frequency shift The
authors realize that the frequency shift is in the opposite
direction. This is attributed to the fact that the animal data
are from hippocampal sites while the human data are most
closely associated with the occipital cortex. It seems, there-
fore, that expectancy as conceived by the model is cor-
related with the shape of the spectra and a frequency shift
Other authors have reported frequency shifts in human
Alpha rhythm that would support an expectancy subset
(Knott and Henry, 1941; Williams, 1940) or at least a
correlation of Alpha with attention (Jasper and Shagass,
1940).

It is the contention of the authors that the subset internal
focus is demonstrated by Figure II. These Ss trained in the
Silva Mind Control system used no external stimuli to
generate their data but rather what can best be described as mental imagery. One of the values of the Bremner
model in this regard is that by defining the subset "internal focus" it becomes unnecessary to use terms such as "con-
sciousness" or "mental imagery." Internal focus depends on antecedent conditions, such as instructions to the Ss, and on
the EEO changes observed. It is of course realized that additional controls will be needed in order to test the reli-
ability and validity of the internal-focus subset. 

This is particularly true in the light of Harts's (1968) criticism that Ss left to themselves in a dimly lit quiet room for
several minutes will increase their Alpha production. The present study (and Brown, 1970) may not be as vulnerable
to this criticism, since it makes use of frequency shifts and shape of spectrum as opposed to those studies which rely on
quantity or amplitude of Alpha (Kamiya, 1968). 

Nevertheless, it is interesting to speculate about the additional frequency shift following introduction of the biogenic feed-
back. In the case of the CC group it might have served to make the UCR and CR more overt thus changing the clas-
sical conditioning paradigm into an instrumental conditioning situation with a CR of high incentive value. For the
Silva-trained group, on the other hand, the feedback might make explicit to the Ss a correlate of internal focus that is
not subjective.

INTERNAL FOCUS AS A SUBSET OF ATTENTION

ABSTRACT
This report attempts to marshal more evidence on internal
focus of attention in humans. The theoretical model used
capitalizes on changes in EEG states as the dependent
variable and a verbal command of the experimenter to start
Alpha generation as the independent variable, in order to
predict internal focus of attention.
In a previous publication (Bremner, et al., 1972) it was
suggested that internal focus was a subset of attention and
this subset was definable by certain antecedent conditions
and certain characteristic EEG changes. The EEG changes
were the generation of Alpha rhythm triggered by stimuli
used as independent variables. This previous study was vul-
nerable to criticism, since Hart had reported (1968) that
some Ss left to themselves in a dimly lit quiet room for
several minutes will increase their Alpha production. It was
reasoned, however, that if S could start and stop the genera-
tion of Alpha frequencies simultaneously with some signal
from the experimenter this would satisfy the question of
spurious appearance of Alpha frequencies as reported by
Hart. If in addition this initiation of Alpha rhythm was re-
lated to S's verbal report of being internally focused it would
provide collateral evidence in support of an internal-focus
subset.
METHOD
Subjects: Ten men and women previously trained to gen-
erate Alpha rhythm served as subjects. Some of these were
those used in the earlier experiment (Bremner, et al.,
1972); nevertheless, all of the Ss reported having consider-
able experience in generating Alpha and conditioned deep
relaxation as well as having had some experience with
psychic exercises.
Appendix III I 223
Apparatus: A Beckman type T electroencephalograph was
used. Electrodes were stainless steel, attached subcutane-
ously over the vertex and occipital areas. EEG data were
visually monitored as well as tape recorded. Additionally, a
microphone hooked into the tape deck was supplied to the
S so that his verbal account of his experience could be tape
recorded. A Digital Equipment Corporation logic pro-
grammer was arranged to indicate a binary number on the
record. The S's face and upper torso were monitored with
a closed-circuit television camera. All data were recorded
on an 8-track Ampex Sp 300 Analog tape deck.
Procedure: Each S filled out a protocol sheet asking for
such information as last use of alcohol or drugs, history of
epileptic seizures, and previous experience with hypnosis or
deep-relaxation techniques. In addition, each S was re-
quired to sign a statement consenting to participate in the
experiment and asserting that the nature and purpose of the
procedure had been explained to him. Each S was told to
generate Alpha by whatever method he was accustomed to
using. A baseline run lasting approximately 5 minutes was
made with S's eyes closed. Ten minutes more or less were
spent in what can be best described as ESP exercises (Silva
Method; McKnight, 1972) in order for the S to establish a
point of reference for Alpha generation. The Ss were then
asked to generate Alpha upon verbal command of the ex-
perimenter while their eyes were closed. When in the
opinion of the experimenter enough EEG data indicated S
was indeed generating Alpha, approximately 30 seconds
later S was given the command to "stop Alpha." The start-
stop command was given until the experimenter felt S was
adequately demonstrating his ability and the record was
sufficiently artifact free. The S was then given the instruc-
tion to "open eyes" and the same start-stop procedure was
continued. None of the Ss in this study evidenced difficulty
generating Alpha; however, some could not always cease
Alpha production upon command, especially when their
eyes were closed. Total time in the chamber for the entire
procedure was approximately 45 minutes.224 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
RESULTS
The results of the study are presented in Figures TV and
V. Although the study was originally designed so that the
data could be spectrally analyzed, the contrast between
Alpha and non-Alpha was so well defined the experimenters
felt that statistical analysis was unnecessary. Figure IV
contains the data for 4 Ss with their eyes closed. The S
symbol on the record (see Figure IV) indicates the start
command while the T (terminate) indicates the command
to stop. Note the contrast between the saw-toothed struc-
ture of the Alpha and the decreased amplitude of the record
following the command to terminate. Figure V contains
data for a set of 5 Ss, 3 Ss with eyes closed and 2 Ss—P8
and T9—with their eyes open (see Figure V). It is interest-
ing to note that S T9 with his eyes open has a several-
second lag after the start command before beginning to
generate Alpha rhythm. This was consistent in all trials with
this S with eyes open. It was demonstrated by S 5 with
eyes closed, and was fairly characteristic of this S. It was
also occasionally demonstrated by some of the other Ss.
The verbal report of all of the above Ss was that they
were in a particular recognizable attentional state. All but
one of the above Ss were able to predict when they were
generating Alpha and when they were not. In other words,
the Ss could say "start" and "stop" and the record would
look the same as Figures IV and V.

DISCUSSION
The results given above would indicate that at least for this
group of Ss the generation of Alpha rhythm is not spurious.
Thus this group of Ss is less vulnerable to the kind of error
pointed out by Hart (1968).
The lag time for some Ss is very interesting, but the
authors can find no ready explanation of why recruiting
takes so long in these Ss. Nevertheless, there was a rela-
Appendix III I 225
tionship between the onset of Alpha rhythm in the EEG,
the subject's unique subjective feeling, and the subjects
verbal response that he was at a particular state of atten-
tion we choose to call the internal-focus subset.
