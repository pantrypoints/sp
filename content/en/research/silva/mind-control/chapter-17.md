Very deep levels of consciousness are involved in Mind Control.

<!-- , and
you may wonder, as others have, whether you face any
dangers as you explore, perhaps for the first time, the
powerful depths of your own mind. -->

Are there any dangers in it?

Jose and those close to him in directing the Mind Control organization say that the benefits of the training are not in even the
smallest way offset by any "untoward side effects," to
use a medical phrase. Putting it another way, no one
who has taken the course is any the worse for it, as far
as Jose and his colleagues know.

One Mind Control graduate, a member of the medical profession, has put Mind Control's safety to an acid test He is Dr. Clancy D. McKenzie, a prominent Philadelphia psychiatrist and psychoanalyst director of the Philadelphia Psychiatric Consultation Service, member of the staff of The Philadelphia Psychiatric Center, and in active private practice. He is also a long-time student of Yoga and other meditational disciplines, biofeedback, and parapsychology.

As part of his studies in these fields, he enrolled in the Mind Control course in 1970. "I wanted to see if
they were actually teaching clairvoyance, as a number of my patients who had benefited from the course reported
to me. I became convinced that something psychic was taking place, and I have since devoted a good deal of
time and thought to investigating it further."

Two other things sparked his interest in Mind Control: a comment made by Sigmund Freud toward the
end of his career, and something that happened in a Mind Control class.

Freud had said that the most promising direction for psychotherapy to take in the future is toward mobiliza-
tion of the patient's energies. Dr. McKenzie clearly saw
people in the Mind Control class using energies they
never knew they had.
But he saw something else in this class: "Three per-
sons out of the thirty were emotionally disturbed and
there was a fourth whose stability was in question.
What was the reason? Did the course precipitate emo-
tional illness or had they been ill when they arrived?
Were my own disturbed patients who had benefited
from the course merely lucky?"
The most practical way to find out, he reasoned, was
to test people before and after the course. The test
would be to observe closely those who were the most
psychologically vulnerable. He and a colleague, Dr.
Lance S. Wright, professor of psychiatry at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, launched a study. During the fol-
lowing four and a half years 189 psychiatric patients
volunteered to go through Mind Control training. To
make the test still more stringent, they focused an even
more detailed study on those in this group who were
A Psychiatrist Works with Mind Control I 125
psychotic, borderline psychotic, or who had recovered
from psychosis. There were 75 of these.
From their observations of the beneficial effect of the
course on healthy people, the results of these tests were
no surprise to Dr. McKenzie and Dr. Wright There was
consistent improvement in mental health among the
psychiatric patients.
For those interested in the close reasoning and tight
controls that guide scientific studies, here are some
details. Of the 75 patients in the disturbed group, 66
were from Dr. Mckenzie's practice. They represented
100 percent of his psychotic and borderline psychotic
patients who were willing to take the course.
At the outset of the study, patients were sent cau-
tiously one at a time so they could be monitored closely
for any HI effects, on themselves or the class. Also, they
were sent during what Dr. McKenzie describes as "their
more stable periods." Later he found he could send
patients during their less stable periods; four went while
they were actively delusional Still later he felt com-
fortable sending several disturbed patients at a time,
sometimes six or more.
As part of his study, he tested 58 of these patients
before and after the course to see what changes it might
cause. The test the Experiential World Inventory, con-
sists of 400 questions designed to measure a person's
perception of reality—something like the famous Ror-
schach ink-blot test but in written form. The difference
between the before and after scores was impressive: 36
showed dramatic improvement in reality perception, 21
remained about the same, and 1 showed a drop.
The person whose score dropped was a twenty-nine-
year-old catatonic schizophrenic who—for the first time
in his life—stopped taking medication and began dat-
ing. "Clinically," observed Dr. McKenzie, "he had more
emotional energy and a brighter outlook following the126 
training. However, the dating threw him into conflict
and he became disturbed two weeks after the course.
He did not require hospitalization."
All these patients, of course, had been in psychother-
apy—many for a year or more—which gave Dr. Mc-
Kenzie an excellent opportunity to see what actual
clinical changes had taken place after the course. Here
are some of his findings:
One patient, a thirty-year-old schizophrenic, earlier
in his life had believed he was under orders, sent tele-
pathicaliy, to kill someone. Fortunately he could never
find the right person. During therapy sessions after the
course he was able to discuss his "delusional system"
for the first time. His emotional energy was much
greater, and he had a brighter outlook on life. Soon he
returned to school to earn a P h D . "His ability to do so
was directly related to his taking the course," explains
Dr. McKenzie.
Of twenty-eight patients suffering from various types
of depression (involutional, psychotic, schizo-affective,
and manic-depressive), 26 felt pleasantly better after
the course. The other two, who reported feeling more
depressed, not only scored better on the questionnaire
but, like the others, were able to work through prob-
lems they had been unable to deal with before.
A twenty-one-year-old woman was determined to
commit suicide and was in the early stage of acute
psychosis. She assured Dr. McKenzie that nothing he
could do would help; she would commit suicide any-
way. He recommended that she take the course. By the
end of the week he was "absolutely amazed; she re-
sponded better than any of the other patients had. It
was one of the most dramatic remissions I had ever
seen."

She found a new calm, was more rational, and her
thoughts no longer raced in quickly changing direc-
A Psychiatrist Works with Mind Control I 127
tions. Just as important, most of her burden of pes-
simism was lifted. In a clinical report, Drs. McKenzie
and Wright say, "Hospitalization and high doses of
medication could not have calmed her as much. She
repeated the course two weeks later and again there was
improvement. The changes were dramatic; she was
better able to work in therapy over the next six
months." A year later, Dr. McKenzie found her fully
recovered from her acute illness.
Psychoses, of course, are severe mental disorders.
Neuroses are far less severe. Of the 189 patients who
sook Mind Control, 114 were suffering only from neu-
msis. All of these benefited too.
Summarizing their clinical findings in the aforemen-
tioned paper, the doctors wrote:
Those who continued to practice Mind Control
after the training were able greatly to alter their
lives by it, and even those who did not practice
it were able to use it in times of crisis, when they
had to cope with stress or had important decisions
to make. For everyone it seemed to be a mind ex-
pansion experience, a revelation that they could
use their rnind in other ways. Group enthusiasm
mounted toward the end of the course and most
persons experienced a higher emotional energy.
The disturbed group also showed an impressive
change clinically. Only the one mentioned [the
twenty-nine-year-old who had just begun dating]
became more upset, and the others at least derived
some benefit from the training. Many persons with
flat affect [little or no emotional response] showed
enthusiasm about something for the first time.
There did seem to be a change in emotional en-
ergy after the course and an improvement in affect.
They had a more positive outlook about their128 
future, and for some there was a better under-
standing of their psychotic processes. The delu-
sional patients were clearly less delusional after
the training.
There was a greater relaxation and lessening of
anxiety. Patients learned to rely on their own re-
sources to understand, cope with and solve prob-
lems, and to be able to do so gave them more
confidence.
With all but one of the 189 patients benefiting from
the course, Dr. McKenzie concludes that it is "more
than just safe and beneficial; it can be immensely use-
ful as an integral part of psychotherapy." He now has
almost all his patients take the course. Some of them
shorten the length of their therapy by as much as two
years with Mind Control techniques.
One of these techniques, Dream Control, he says
"may very well prove to be a major breakthrough in
psychiatry. It is a swift and reliable way to understand
and solve problems."
Trained in Freudian analysis, Dr. McKenzie sees
no conflict between the way Freudians interpret spon-
taneous dreams and the way Mind Control graduates
interpret their programmed dreams. "The Freudian
dream wish becomes the wish to have the answer,'' he
explains. However, he cautions, "It is necessary to make
certain an unconscious dream wish did not supersede
the conscious wish to have the answer."
A patient whom Dr. McKenzie had been treating for
some time called to say she was about to be admitted
to a hospital because of chest and stomach pains. He
told her he wanted her in a psychiatric hospital instead.
The call was no surprise; he had seen this coming for
some time. Her mental condition had been worsening.
In the psychiatric hospital, Dr. McKenzie told her to
A Psychiatrist Works with Mind Control I 129
program a dream to answer four questions: What is the
problem? Where is it? What caused it? How can I get
rid of it?
Here is what she dreamed: She, her husband, and
their three children were driving along a winding road.
I: began to snow and the car slid off the road. Soon the
car was covered with snow. Her husband told her to cut
oS the engine; then eight or ten people came from the
city to dig them out. When they emerged from the car,
their three children were gone.
Just ahead, the road came to a dead end. Another
road went off at a right angle into another road at a
right angle, which in turn led to still another road—a
superhighway, also at a right angle.
As he heard her recount this dream, Dr. McKenzie
suspected she was describing an intestinal tract and
asked her to draw a map of the "winding road." She did
and, sure enough, the road accurately followed the
course of a human intestinal tract—all in correct pro-
portion. What's more, a later medical examination
found an obstruction at a spot corresponding exactly
with where her car slid from the road—where the small
intestine meets the large one. In other words, this wom-
an's dream (she knew almost nothing about anatomy;
she is a high-school drop-out) accurately pinpointed
her obstruction in a one-inch segment of a twenty-foot
human intestinal tract!

Still more: The snow, according to the symbolism of
her dream, was a dairy product which caused her in-
testinal upset and in some way triggered the build-up of
the obstruction.

Her husband's advice to cut off the engine was—
again, in symbolic form—the best advice she could get:
It meant "shut off the fuel supply to the body; stop
eating."

The eight or ten persons who dug them out are, in130 
dream language, the fingers of the two hands. This may
represent the healing "laying on of hands" or surgery.
The sudden absence of the children was wish fulfill-
ment She wanted them out of the way to get more of
her husband's attention for herself.
Dr. McKenzie had her transferred to a medical hos-
pital because, normally, an intestinal obstruction like
this calls for immediate surgery. However—armed with
this understanding of her dream and with the knowl-
edge, gained in Mind Control class, of the power of the
mind over the body, plus the anticipation of surgery—
she began to release the obstruction. An hour after Dr.
McKenzde's dream-based diagnosis was medically con-
firmed at the hospital, she had freed herself of the ob-
struction and no surgery was necessary. Her surgeon
*as amazed.

Dr. McKenzie later learned that this woman had had
surgery for an intestinal obstruction four times in the
past twenty yean, and her surgeons told him that each
time it had been in the same place. It appeared she
had learned to produce the illness whenever there was a
psychological need for it
Later, this woman's eighteen-year-old daughter came
to him with a problem—she was pregnant and un-
married. "What on earth should I do?" she asked. Once
again he advised Dream Control to find the answer. In
hex dream, a man appeared. He said, "Have the baby,
wait three years, marry the man, then move out of the
state."
"I couldn't have given her better advice," Dr. Mc-
Kenzie said. "The divorce rate among teenagers is
eighty percent so three years' waiting at home was
logical. The man was the right person for her, but for
a successful marriage they would be better off away
from home, far from parents."
In another case, Dream Control led to a totally new
A Psychiatrist Works with Mind Control / 131
therapeutic technique, which saved years of therapy
time. This patient's problem was that whenever her
husband was more than ten minutes late for dinner she
slashed her wrists. For months Dr. McKenzie tried to
explain that, while she thought she was responding to
her husband's tardiness, she was actually experiencing
an earlier feeling, from childhood, when her alcoholic
father would not come home. Once she understood this
she would stop her wrist-slashing, but Dr. McKenzie
was not getting through. The way things were going, the
woman faced two more years of twice-a-week therapy.
Dr. McKenzie suggested that she program a dream.
Her dream turned out to be an amazingly creative
one, which solved her problem overnight.
She dreamed that Dr. McKenzie taped some state-
ments that upset her the most She played this tape at
home and recorded her reactions to it on a second tape.
Then she played the second tape for Dr. McKenzie to
interpret. To each of his interpretations she exclaimed,
"Oh, how stupid of mel" His interpretations pointed out
that she was confusing two different realities, past and
present Her dream led her to understand this for the
first time. She never slashed her wrists again.
"This remarkable programmed dream cured the pa-
ttern altogether. A three-year follow-up confirmed that
she remained well," Dr. McKenzie reported.
Another patient suffered from claustrophobia, and
he struggled for more than a year to get at its cause. It
turned out to be an interesting one. In a programmed
dream he and three other persons were in a rectangle
outlined by a rope on the ground. Outside this rec-
tangle, at one corner, was a smaller one, also outlined
by a rope. Everyone was trying to get out of the larger
rectangle through the smaller one.
The significance of this dream becomes clear when
you see the larger area as the womb, the smaller one as132 
the cervix. Outside was a green pasture with cows
(breasts).
One of the patient's companions ran toward the
smaller rectangle but was stopped by an invisible bar-
rier (the uterine wall). A string of tin cans was at-
tached to him near his belt buckle (an umbilical cord).
The patient knew that somehow he would have to
get out of there, but he decided to let the others go first.
It gave him a sort of nervous feeling, like giving a
speech—something he knew he had to do even though
it caused stress and anxiety (birth trauma)—but there
was relief after it was over.
The other three in the rectangle were his brothers
and sister.
This one dream gave him the insight he needed into
his claustrophobia.
What makes the dream particularly interesting is not
that it takes a person back prior to birth—this is fairly
common—but its reference to the "invisible barrier.''
Does this, Dr. McKenzie wonders, suggest the pos-
sibility of clairvoyance prior to birth?
Dr. McKenzie not only advises his patients to use
Mind Control, he uses it himself to help his patients.
"Some of the most amazing wisdom comes to me when
I'm using Dream Control."
One night he programmed a dream about a patient
in psychoanalysis, a twenty-seven-year-old man who
had not dated in two years. Women were against him,
"and besides, they were no good." In his dream, Dr.
McKenzie heard himself say, "It's okay with me if you
never have a heterosexual relationship." Next time the
patient complained about women, that is exactly what
Dr. McKenzie said to him.
It worked. The patient was stunned. Avoiding wom-
en was his way of resisting treatment—now it would
no longer work. Besides, he was panicked when he
A Psychiatrist Works with Mind Control I 133
thought of never having a healthy relationship with a
woman.
That night he did.
Dr. McKenzie, who has become a consultant to Silva
Mind Control, continues to search for new ways to use
Mind Control to improve and speed up psychiatric
treatment At the same time, he is looking for ways to
use Mind Control in far broader areas of medical prac-
tice—in the diagnosis of illnesses.
The first step in this search is to find ways of measur-
ing the reliability of Mind Control's technique of work-
ing cases. After three years of research, he believes he
is coming close to what he terms an "absolute research
design," one that eliminates all the variables and mea-
sures only what it sets out to measure. His purpose is
to find ways to put case working to medical use.
Medical diagnosis sometimes involves exploratory
surgery or drugs that may cause discomfort or danger
to the patient—and no diagnostic technique is accurate
all the time. Psychic diagnosis would pose no hazard
for the patient provided its reliability can be demon-
strated. This is what Dr. McKenzie is working on.
The first time he tried his new research design was
in a Mind Control graduate class of 30 persons. The
accuracy of the results was greater than what chance
would produce by 200 to one. He was encouraged, but
he wanted to refine his methods even more and to ar-
range for the scoring to be computerized.
He checked out his plans with the statistics depart-
ment of the University of Pennsylvania, and they agreed
that he had indeed eliminated the variables that plague
psychic research and that his measurements would be
accurate.
The Mind Control newsletter published drawings of
two human bodies (see pages 134-35) with circles for
readers to check. They were given, as in case work, the134

CASE B136 
name, age, sex, and location of two persons who were ill. What they were not given, what Dr. McKenzie himself did not know, was the nature of the illnesses. The Florida physician who gave him the cases was to reveal this only after results were in.

Doing two cases rather than one is central to the new research design. This permits Dr. McKenzie to weed out all the guesses. For example, if patient A but not patient B had an injury to the left ankle, any circles checked on patient B's left ankle would be guesses. 

If 5 readers guessed B's left ankle, it is reasonable to assume that the same number would be guessing A's. 

Suppose 50 readers checked A's left ankle. Dr. McKenzie would substract 5 from this number as guesses
and conclude that 45 were operating psychically. The
computer would then measure the statistical signifi-
cance of the results.

For this to work, the two cases must be different. If they both had injured left ankles, this method of weed-
ing out the non-psychic answers could not be used. 

The Florida physician goofed; he supplied two cases which, it turned out, had injuries to the same area of
the body. Dr. McKenzie had to change his plans and study the results some other way. Instead of comparing
case A with case B, he compared the number of correct responses with the next-largest number of responses.
Although the computer told him the results could have happened by chance only once in almost a billion times,
he still does not consider his experiment conclusive because his research design could not be followed.

There are many more facets to his design than are outlined here, and he has conducted many other experiments that produced what he terms "statistically significant results." His entire project is so significant that we will surely hear more about it when he has refined his technique even more. Instead of simply having them check a circle to indicate the location of an illness, he will give Mind Control graduates lists of medical ailments to check, thereby providing specific diagnosis.

"These preliminary studies," he said, ''point toward high levels of statistical significance. I am not ready,
though, to draw conclusions from them. A lot more painstaking work is needed. If later studies are equally
encouraging, we may have a way of putting psychics to work to help physicians in their diagnosis in ways even
more reliable than those being used now. This just could turn out to be a medical breakthrough. It's too early to
say for sure, but that's what I'm working toward." 

Mind Control's Research Director, J. Wilfred Hahn, a biochemist and former president of Mind Science
Foundation, shares Dr. McKenzie's hopes. "Ever since the nineteenth century, when the scientific method was
brought to bear on psychic research, uncontrolled (sometimes unknown) variables left questions hanging
over the findings. Whether Dr. McKenzie achieves a medical breakthrough is, as he says, yet to be deter-
mined. But I believe he has already achieved a breakthrough in his research method. From all the data he
gathers, he can concentrate the psychic responses—he can eliminate all the garbage, leaving only what he
wants to study, just as a chemist studying a single trace element in water can eliminate the water and all other
elements except the one he wants to study."
