We waste too much of our time dragging ourselves under. If we spent 1/2 of it just researching in our mind how to deal with life, we'd find we're so much stronger than we think

Carol became a Mind Control graduate on the recommendation of another graduate, singer Marguerite Piazza.

Most of us are imprisoned by narrow ideas of who we are and what we can do. 

You will soon smash these confines and find new freedoms. 
- When you see what you are capable of, your self-esteem will soar. 

A number of studies have been made of this. 
- They cover large groups with no special problems as well as others whose self-esteem is obviously in shambles—students as well as alcoholics, drug addicts, prisoners, and the welfare poor.

Mind Control has been taught, often as a full-credit course, in:
- 24 colleges and universities
- 16 high schools
- 8 elementary schools.

The same course is taught in different schools to students of:
- different ages
- different cultural and economic backgrounds.

The results have been so uniform that it can now be safely claimed that in basic respects they are predictable. 

Introduce Mind Control in a school and the result will be students with more powerful self-direction, greater self-guidance or greater ego strength sternming from improved ability to solve problems on their own. 

This has been scientifically measured by Dr. George De Sau. 

The first test, in 1972, was at Hallahan High School in Philadelphia, where 2,000 students took the course.

A week before and two weeks after, 220 randomly selected students were given the High School Personality Questionnaire*.

It consists of 140 questions that sensitively measure a person's self-image.

His total self-image is a portrait with 14 characteristics:
- adventurous
- zestful
- self-assured
- and so on.

The test is widely used in research and counseling.

The self-image portraits of these 220 students were combined into a single group profile, then compared before and after. 

Results: major shifts toward higher ego strength, self-assurance, and composure, and away from impatience, insecurity, and detachment. 

In some respects students remained unchanged—as in balance between dominance and submissiveness, tender- and tough-rnindedness. What all this added up to was that these students had greater respect for themselves after Mind Control than they had before.

Naturally, with life's changing patterns, our view of ourselves changes from day to day. If we gave the test to a randomly selected group and then repeated it three weeks later, we would find some changes. This too has been studied by those who developed the test.

The random changes that would occur by chance are a normal expectation, and their rate has been calculated. To evaluate the results at Hallahan High, it was necessary to determine by how much the reported changes exceeded those that chance alone could produce. 

Here is what was found:

For chance to produce positive changes in ego strength as great as those brought about by Mind Control at Hallahan High, the test would have to be given more than a thousand times to a randomly selected group—more than a thousand times to match the change in self-assurance, more than a thousand times to match the change in composure. What made the difference was not chance but Mind Control.

While the course was in progress, a Philadelphia Daily News reporter, Joe Clark, interviewed some students during a lunch break. 

In an article that appeared September 27,1972, he quoted thirteen-year-old Kathy
Brady, who had been biting her nails since she was eight: "I always bit them when I got nervous. 

When I was in the auditorium this morning I felt like biting them, but I didn't I just thought to myself, Don't bite your nails.' 

I closed my eyes and relaxed."

Pat Eisenlohr told him she had passed up a fight with her younger brother, something that had hardly ever happened before. "I told myself, There's no use in
getting mad. Why fight?' 

I didn't. 

I also got rid of a headache this morning by telling myself to get rid of it
I know it sounds weird, but it works."

Now let's compare results at this school with 2 other studies, one at Lawrenceville, a co-ed Catholic high school in Pittsburgh, and the other at St Fidelis, a Catholic high school for men planning to become
priests. 

At Lawrenceville and St Fidelis, as at Hallahan, the greatest change among the students was in ego strength. 

What's more, this change was uniform—in each school the group profile improved to a degree that could have occurred by chance alone only once in a thousand times. 

The same degree of change occurred in composure at Hallahan and Lawrenceville, though less at
St Fidelis. Varying degrees of change in self-assurance,
though all sharply positive, occurred at all three
schools.

The findings of which the above are a part did not fully satisfy Dr. De Sau. Although he was cheered by the positive results and reassured by the uniform pat-
tern of benefits from Mind Control, something was
missing. Tests of a group before, then two weeks after
Mind Control training do not indicate whether these
benefits are of lasting value. Testing four months after
the training would.

Dr. De Sau did this at Lawrenceville and St. Fidelis; he faced some surprises. In all the above characteristics —ego strength, self-assurance, composure—the students of both schools improved far more over the four-month
period than they had during the two weeks immediately
following the course!

In his report on these studies, Dr. De Sau concluded:

Perhaps the changes which took place with the above students in their various educational settings can best be evaluated from a perspective such as that held by John Holt, educator and author. 

It is Holt's position that the educational process has often been one of teaching stupidity through contributing to the increasing of anxiety, guilt, and almost continuous reliance upon the external environment for approval or disapproval—all the conditions which may produce conforming, neurotic, robopathic behavior but do little to enhance education or human growth. There are reasonable grounds to believe the same conditions are found
in other societal institutions.

The research data above indicate, at least from the educational perspective, a refreshing, viable alternative. 

A factor of change which is persistent and strong after Mind Control training is that of a shifting to internal points of reference—another way of saying the recognition by an individual of his own value and a significant step toward self-
control as opposed to being controlled by external others.
