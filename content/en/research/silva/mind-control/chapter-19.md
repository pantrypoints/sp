Imagine believing in Murphy's Law—"If anything can go wrong, it will, and at the worst possible time"—then
suddenly discovering that there is no such law but, instead, the cosmic Bill of Rights that Jose wrote about
You feel luckier because you are luckier.

Many Mind Control graduates say this is what happens in their working lives. The salesman finds his
customers more open to him; the scientist finds sudden answers to perplexing problems; the professional athlete
racks up better scores; the unemployed find jobs; the employed enjoy their jobs more.

"When I meet with Mind Control graduates throughout the company," said Michael Higgins, 44 year-old Director of Employment Development at the
Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., plant in Nutley, New Jersey, "I find a consistent positive attitude and cheerfulness
reflected in these people, and I experience this on a continuing basis."

Hoffmann-La Roche is one of the world's giant pharmaceutical manufacturers. "This may surprise you,
coming from a manufacturer of tranquilizers," Higgins said, "but we are open to alternative means of achieving better mental health, and this was one of our motivations for originally exploring Silva Mind Control in 1973."

Another thing that motivated Mr. Higgins to investigate the course is that few of the most effective em-
ployees of any company are fully as effective as they could be. What he found at Mind Control led him to
plan a pilot project that would lead initially to a company-backed program, and from there build enough
enthusiasm to take off on its own. He announced the plan, "signed up 50 people overnight," and turned to
Reverend Albert Gorayeb, pastor of a church in neighboring Paterson, who is one of Mind Control's more
charismatic lecturers.

The plan succeeded. Now, three years later, there are more than three hundred graduates at the plant—top
executives, scientists, secretaries, engineers, laboratory assistants, and personnel managers. Some took the
course under company sponsorship, many on their own. 

"I was particularly fascinated by the research people who took the course. At first they were the most vigor-
ous scoffers, but they turned out to be the most enthusiastic of all," Mr. Higgins said.
Here are some comments from Hoffmann-La Roche's Mind Control graduates, published m the plant's news-
paper, Inside Roche: From a merchandising director: "It gave me a new
sense of awareness about myself and the importance of
interacting and working with fellow employees. I am
applying what I learned by trying to develop the ability
to channel my interests and accomplishments so there
is less wasted time and motion."

From an assistant biochemist: "My whole mental attitude has changed; as a result I'm convinced that good
things really happen when you look at life positively.

It's amazing how much warmth flows between 2 people when you are pleasant and tolerant of each other."
From a personnel administrator: "It is one of the best things that has happened to me and I consider it a
privilege to have been able to participate. 

The course emphasizes positive thinking. It helped me develop an inner peace and build up my confidence."
From a plant services supervisor: "Mentally, I feel better—I don't worry as much or handle everything as
an emergency, and I've learned to relax and control my
headaches. The key to success is belief."
From a senior systems analyst: "Increased con-
fidence and a general feeling of well-being are results of
the course, which teaches us how to recognize parts of
our nature that are usually ignored. For example, the
program heightens sensitivity to other people and makes
us more aware of intuitive experiences that the rational
mind tends to deny."
A business built from the ground up with Mind Con-
trol techniques is the Idea Banque, Inc., in Chicago—
a co-op for Mind Control graduates with marketable
inventions. It started when Richard Herro, who is in
charge of Mind Control activities in the Chicago area,
posed a complex marketing problem to see if the kind
of intuition sparked by Alpha and Theta could lead
to practical answers. Mr. Herro, with ten years' ex-
perience as a marketing consultant behind him, already
had a perfectly good answer—it had taken him ten
years to work k out. Mind Control graduates came up
with perfectly good answers too—in ten minutes.
"I pretty much expected something like this, but
what I wasn't ready for was that the nontechnical peo-
ple did far better on technical problems than experts.
They aren't locked into logic and can explore more
possibilities.158 
"I had to conclude," he said, "that the combined in-
telligence of twenty people at their level, tapping their
creative imagination, is about a thousand times as ef-
fective as the intelligence of twenty people trying to rea-
son their way 1o a solution."
Using the same problem-solving techniques himself,
he invented and patented a new way of making pre-
stressed concrete. Then Mind Control graduates began
coming up with ideas of their own and needed marketing
know-how. "That's how the Idea Banque was born,"
he explains.
Altogether, the Idea Banque, now in its second year,
has eighteen inventions on or ready for the market and
about a score in the works. One is a "leaf-eater," a
lawn-mower attachment for making mulch of leaves. A
firm which markets products by television bought two
and a half million of them. Another is an adhesive
patch for torn screens. Instead of being invisible, this
one catches the eye. The "Bug Plug" is colored and
shaped like a bug.
The company meets once a month for problem solv-
ing through meditation. Its members are those with
ideas with a profit potential. They pay an initial fee
plus a small monthly fee and share in the profits.
Another business group founded by Mind Control
graduates in the Chicago area is, or was, an investment
club. A stockbroker thought his new ability to move
backward or forward in time could be put to advantage
in selecting stocks. If in meditation you see a stock in
the future, buy it now and sell it in the future. The plan
appealed to Mr. Herro, and a club was formed. Mr.
Herro, the broker, and other members were enthusi-
astic but not quite sure. Mind Control has solved a
sweeping spectrum of problems but never, as far as
Mind Control in the Business World I 159
anyone knew, the problem of accurately foreseeing the
ups and downs of prices on Wall Street.
With this healthy skepticism, members held on to
their cash during the first six months of weekly trial
runs.
Each week the broker provided the names of ten
stocks. The members, in Alpha, visualized themselves
thirty days in the future. They saw themselves in a
broker's office or reading a newspaper, learning how
each of the stocks had done. When they returned to
the present, in Beta, their findings were tallied. When
the vote was IVi to 1 in favor of a stock, a purchase
was made—on paper.
At the very outset a problem cropped up. Members
had to learn that cheery optimism, one of the marks of
a Mind Control graduate, is often a poor guide to what
the stock market will do. They started off seeing all the
stocks rising. However, they learned quickly and were
soon making "hits." The group's "portfolio" began to
do better than the market average.
Another problem set in. With growing enthusiasm,
the psychic investors began reading about the stocks
they had selected, becoming more and more informed.
They brought this objective information to their medita-
tions and their paper profits dipped.
The answer to this was to give each stock a coded
number so that no one would know which stock he was
psychically studying. Results improved, once again
ahead of market averages. Now, with six months of
data proving that trained psychics can outpace the
stock market, it was time to put up real money.
The transition from trial runs to real investing went
smoothly. Members racked up real profits. When the
market went down, so did their stocks, but not as much
as the market as a whole. When the market rose, so did
their stocks, even more than the market. However, after160 
about a year, a bitch developed. The market went down
more than up. The group's portfolio went down too,
though not as sharply. Still, it was down, and the pride
the group felt in outperforming the market was tem-
pered by their losses.
Any sophisticated investor will tell you that money
can be made instead of lost when the market is going
down. Just sell short. You sell a stock now, even
though you do not have it, then buy and deliver it
later after the price goes down. Perfectly legal—but this
is making a profit from others' losses or, to put it an-
other way, having a vested interest in bad news—not
for Mind Control graduates. The club was suspended.
As this is being written, the market is rising, and Mr.
Herro reports the members may start again.
His interest in Mind Control's usefulness in business
extends to sports, which, he says, is just as much a
business as marketing new products and investing in
the stock market. You may have heard that a number
of the Chicago White Sox players took Mind ControL
This was widely publicized in the summer of 1975, on
CBS-TVs 60 Minutes and NBC-TV's Today show. This
was largely Mr. Herro's doing.
When the baseball season ended, he compared the
players' individual scores—before Mind Control (1974)
and after (1975). They all improved, most of them
dramatically.
Among the most enthusiastic Mind Control grad-
uates are salesmen. "I go into my level and visualize a
successful call. The results have been remarkable.
Every month I tell myself I'm going to produce X dol-
lars, setting higher and higher goals, and I keep mak-
ing them." This was said by a salesman for one of Wall
Street's more prestigious firms. A vice-president of a
Mind Control in the Business World I 161
small steel company said, "I tell myself, 'I'm going to
sell this guy,' and it works. Now I'm recommending it
[Mind Control] to my salesmen, my partners, even my
children. I think everyone can benefit by it, and not sole-
ly in their work but in their personal lives as well."
In terms of numbers of reports from graduates, the
most impressive results are in finding new jobs. The
calm self-confidence that comes from Mind Control
training probably accounts for this as much as any
other factor—the self-assurance necessary to seek out
a better job, the greater ease with which the graduate
conducts job interviews, these alone can turn the tide
in a person's career.
A photographer with a wife and two children sud-
denly lost his job, and he wrote to his lecturer:
If this had happened five years ago, I would
have hit the closest bar with all the justification
in the world of getting roaring drunk . . . and cry-
ing in the beer of die unemployed guy beside me.
NOW with Mind C o n t r o l . . . separating clouds
so I could shoot aerial photos without shadows
on the ground, immediately healing dozens of cuts
and bruises, and finding dozens of lost articles, just
by looking on my screen, I wasn't the least bit
worried about it being able to find me another
job.

All I did was enter my level and I saw myself going to college, which I thought was a riot in
view of the fact that I am already a college graduate. . . . Investigation revealed, however, that I
am actually eligible under the GI bill and will make $400 for the effort, and that plus $300 from
unemployment will give me $700 take-home, which is $200 more than I was making when I had the162 
job. Plus the fact that I can now peddle to AP, UPI, and magazines.

Another person who recovered from a sodden job loss was a very new graduate in New York. He put in an angry phone call to Jose and said, "Now tell me about Mind Control!" Jose calmly told him to keep working with his mental screen and other techniques. 

Three days later he called Jose in a sharply different frame of mind. He'd just landed a job paying three times as much as the one he lost

Perhaps the most colorful experience with Mind Control in business is reported by a man and his wife who open other people's safes. Here is how they do it: One of them goes psychically to the laboratory, evokes a vivid mental image of the safe and its owner, then turns back the clock and watches closely as the man opens his safe. The other, acting as orientologist, makes careful note of the numbers as they are called out.

Later, in Beta, the psychic pays a house call and, in Beta, opens the safe for its amazed and grateful owner.

The psychic, a licensed locksmith in the Midwest, is often called upon to open safes for owners who cannot
recall their combination.
