Your first accomplishment with Mind Control will launch you on an odyssey of self-discovery. 

When you have made everything work for you, several paths for future development will be opened.

You can still use other books or courses and add to your mental tools. 

On the other hand, you might get used to miracles repeating over and over, with the excitement of your new discoveries fading. This might cause you to slack off and drift back to where you were at the outset.

Or, you might find that one Mind Control works better for you than others, you may specialize in that one and make it a reliable part of your life.

If you begin a search for other techniques, you will find many that work. 

Chances are, the ones you find have already been researched by Jose and set aside in favor of his course. Those who become technique collectors take time away from developing a few useful ones to the point of mastery.

If you find that your excitement dims and you drift away from practicing Mind Control, you are not alone. 

More important, your experience will not be a total loss. 

Jose has observed that, once acquired, Mind Control training is never completely lost and can be recalled and put to use in an emergency.

What many Mind Control graduates do is settle for one particular technique that works best for them. The more they use it, the better the results. 

However, there is a fourth way better than any of these three. 

Mind Control is a very careful selection of mental exercises and techniques that reinforce each other. To ignore one because it does not work as well for you as
another is to pass up the opportunity of truly full development. 

Dream Control reinforces your ability with the Mental Screen; the Mental Screen makes Dream Control more reliable and vivid. 

The course, and Josh's chapters here, are all of a piece; the whole is much greater than the parts.
Still, you may wonder where you go next when you have practiced it all and made it work.

Simply making Mind Control work is not enough.

There are always degrees of control, subtleties of experience ahead of you.

A student once asked Jose, "At what point does a person know he has gotten out of Mind Control everything there is to get?" 

"When you can convert all your problems into projects and make your projects work out the way you want them to," he answered. 

Then he paused a moment and added, "No . . . it goes deeper than that When you realize what enormous powers we were all
born with, when you see in your own experience that these powers can only be used constructively, you come to realize that there is a dignity and a purpose behind
our presence on this planet My own opinion is that the purpose we must serve is to evolve, and this evolution is now our own, individual responsibility. 

I think most people have a kind of weak hunch about this. The more you practice Mind Control, the stronger this
hunch becomes until it becomes a firm certainty." 

It is this depth of experience that awaits you—the "firm certainty" that there is a benign purpose behind
everything. In Mind Control, this comes not as a mystical flash after years of life-renouncing meditation, but
quite soon, out of the daily business of living more effectively—from the everyday details of life as well as
its destiny-shaping events.

Let's take a very small incident the kind a new Mind Control graduate might experience, and we will see how
it becomes a step toward building this "firm certainty."

The first thing a recent graduate did on returning home from vacation was to remove the film from his camera
and then search his luggage for another roll of exposed film. He could not find it The film was not a great loss,
but an annoying one; it was a record of the first week of his vacation.

He went to his level and relived the moment he last put film in his camera; but all he saw on his Mental Screen was the camera itself on his coffee table, where he had put the first roll in, not the second. He stayed at his level and went from one picture-taking moment to another, but still no scene of bis reloading the cam- era. Stubbornly, the coffee-table scene kept reappearing.

Convinced that his Mental Screen had failed, he turned in the one roll of film for developing. When it came back it contained all the photographs he had taken, from the beginning to the end of his vacation.

There never was a second roll.

As small as this incident was, it provided the graduate with the first concrete reason he had encountered
outside the class for having more confidence in his own mind. With a few more small incidents like this, then
several major ones in which he helps not only himself but someone else as well, his view of himself and the
world around him will change. His life will be changed because he will be on the brink of that firm certainty.

Along the way, he may achieve something like the following: A graduate who had been practicing Mind Control for several months had a daughter who was
allergic to his family's two cats. Whenever she played with them she wheezed uncomfortably and broke out in a rash. He put the problem, then imagined the solution, on his Mental Screen during his meditations for about a week. The solution he imagined was his daughter playing with their cats, breathing easily, with no rash. 

One day he saw in real life what he had been imagining. His daughter was no longer allergic to cats. Both these cases involved the Mental Screen alone. 

They were both successful, so, you might ask, why bother with other techniques?

In the first case, if the graduate had learned nothing except how to use his Mental Screen, it is just possible
that he would have achieved the same results—assuming that he had simply triggered the recall of a "forgot-
ten" fact and that Higher Intelligence did not come into play, which is far from certain.

However, the second case involved a broad range of Mind Control training—going to level, visualization exercises, Effective Sensory Projection for the telepathic
transmission of healing, Dream Control, and case working, so that he could add a full measure of expectancy to his desire and belief.

With extensive practice, your mind will begin to take short-cuts. It will become sensitive to faint signals on important matters and will pass them on to you without your having to search for them. 

One Mind Control graduate's life may have been saved this way. She was meditating one morning just before going to work, using her Mental Screen to correct a small office problem, when a large black X blocked out the scene she was trying to create. Then it blocked out all other scenes
connected with her office. A "hunch" too strong to ignore told her to avoid her office that day, and she
happily stayed home. 

Later she learned that if she had gone to the office that day she would have walked into an armed robbery in which several persons were badly
injured. This is the kind of information we would normally get with Dream Control, but the Mental Screen
was what she was using and that is where it came through.

Here is another case, in which the mind was so trained that in a serious emergency it was brought under
control by a graduate without taking time to go into Alpha. Many of the events described in the following
letter were attested to by nine witnesses. 

Wednesday, I came home from shopping, my arms loaded with bags. I opened the screen door,
which swung back on me before I could open the inside door. 

Impatiently, I gave the door a hard push. To my horror, it slammed back fast, and the pointed door handle stuck in my arm below the
elbow. I dropped the bags and slowly pulled the handle out of my arm. I could see down through
layers and layers of tissue into a deep hole. 

Then blood started to well up, filling the hole, flowing over. I didn't have time to feel faint Instead, I concentrated intensely on stopping the bleeding. A great surge of joy shot through me when the bleeding stopped—I could barely believe my eyes While I was washing and cleansing the wound, the first pains came. I sat down and went to my level, trying to find out whether I should cancel a trip to Boston to hear Major Thompson at a Mind Control meeting and go to a doctor instead. But I felt a strong urge to go to Boston, also a strong urge to test my belief in having learned to control pain.

I worked on my pain incessantly on the way to Boston. But during the lecture it became so severe and my fingers so numb that even at my level I could hardly stand it. I felt guilty that I couldn't listen to the lecture—yet next day I was able to repeat it almost word for word.

While in such severe pain, I kept calling for help psychically over and over. Martha must have heard my cry because, after the lecture, as people wandered over to the coffee table, she insisted on seeing my "cut." When I raised the bandage, the wound was still gaping open. A piece of flesh had been somewhat dislodged when I pulled out the handle, and the skin around it was purplish black.

She went for help and, having found out where the nearest hospital was, came back with Dennis Storin. I said I did not want to go to the hospital.

I wanted Dennis to work on it, so we withdrew to a quiet corner where Dennis went to his level. 

Once he started to work on the wound, my pain became so intense that I had to go to my level to work on it, too. As he began knitting the broken tissue together bit by bit, his fingers seemed to draw out the pain in huge waves. The wound became so sensitive I felt like screaming! I tried to concentrate on making the pain go away and on sending help to Dennis and to myself, over and over and over again—successfully combating the Where Do We Go from Here?

urge, undoubtedly conceived in Beta, to tell him to stop and let me go to an accident room. I really wanted it to work.
And, after hours, it seemed, I could feel the pain begin to subside. First, I felt about ten percent less
pain, then about fifteen percent. When Dennis asked how it was, about a quarter of the pain had
gone. 

As we continued, the inner tissues mended.

Then, as the outer layers began to mend, the pain became even more intense. Despite my concentration on the healing, I was slightly conscious of people moving around me—especially of someone standing behind me, taking away some of the pain when I needed it most desperately. I felt so grateful Then the next waves started, and I had to concentrate hard on coping with them. 

Then we worked on closing the deepest part of the wound. I felt people forming a circle around us to give us strength. I could feel the energy surging through me—it almost lifted me off the chair. 

Dennis could feel it, too, and with the help of the others, the healing progressed much faster. Some of those in the circle later told me that they could see the wound closing, the swelling going down, the skin turning from an unhealthy purple to reddish^purple, to red, to pink, and, finally, the 2 outer layers of skin coming together like the well-cut pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 

When we got back to where my car was parked, my friends wanted to drive me to Warwick—they didn't want the wound to open up when I used my arm on the stick shift of the car. But I refused. I knew I would get home safely. And so I did—with absolutely no pain!

Next morning, I woke up in fine shape. My arm felt as if I had been in a fight—I've never been beaten up, but I imagine it must feel like that!

But there was no pain, and my arm looked great I sat up in bed and saw our beautiful world bathed in brilliant sunshine. I felt as if I had been reborn!

As you can see, if you continue to explore the potentials of your mind, it will pay off in priceless ways. 

In this respect says Dr. J. Wilfred Hahn, Mind Control's Director of Research, every Mind Control graduate becomes his own director of research.

"In what other field of research," he asked, "are expensive laboratories and sophisticated equipment so un-
necessary? The most sophisticated research tool ever developed—one so remarkable that I am in awe whenever I think of it—is at your disposal and mine 24 four hours a day: our minds. We are all, therefore, directors of research."

One important advantage that we have now is that for the first time in the history of modern science, psychic research is becoming respectable. The danger of a serious investigator being put down as an irresponsible crackpot as Jose" was in his early days, is vastly reduced.

This danger, however, is not entirely behind us.

There are physicians learning to use Mind Control in
their practice, industrial scientists who use Dream Control to put them on the track of new products, men and
women in all walks of life—some mentioned anonymously in this book—who say, "Don't use my name. My friends will think I'm crazy." 

This is becoming more and more rare. Hundreds of thousands of Mind Control graduates proudly speak of what they are accomplishing with their training. Respected medical journals carry scientific and clinical papers on psychic heeling and mind-body interactions.

Where Do We Go from Here? I 171

Men and women in the public eye—members of the Chicago White Sox and performing artists such as Carol Lawrence and Marguerite Piazza (mentioned earlier), Larry Blyden, Celeste Holm, Loretta Swit, Alexis Smith, and Vicki Can*—all these have spoken out publicly of their Mind Control experiences.

Where do we go from here? Down a long path of exciting self-discovery. 

With each new finding yoti will
be closer to the goal of the ultimate research project
spelled out for us by William Blake:
To see a world in a grain of sand And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.
