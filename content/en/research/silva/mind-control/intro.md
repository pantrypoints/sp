You are now setting out on one of the most transforming adventures of your life. Each result you achieve will change your view of yourself and of the world you were born into. 

With your new powers will come a responsibility to use them "for the betterment of mankind"-a Mind Control phrase. 

You cannot use them otherwise, as you are about to learn.

The city planner of a Western city closed his office door, leaving his secretary alone and troubled at her desk. 

The drawings for a proposed shopping mall were missing, and a yes-or-no meeting with city officials was scheduled for later that same week. Jobs have been lost for less, but the planner seemed almost untouched by what would have driven other bosses into a secretary-shattering storm.

He sat at his desk. In a moment his eyes closed and he became still and quiet. Anyone might have thought he was composing himself in the face of disaster.

A full ten minutes later he opened his eyes, rose slowly, and walked outside to his secretary. "I think I've
found them," he said calmly. "Let's look at my expense
account for last Thursday, when I was in Hartford.
What restaurant did I have dinner in?"

He telephoned the restaurant The drawings were there.

The city planner had been trained in Silva Mind Control, to awaken what for most of us are unused talents of the mind. One of the things he learned was to retrieve memories that have been quirreled away where the untrained mind cannot find them.

These awakened talents are doing amazing things for the more than 500,000 men and women who have taken the course.

What exactly was the city planner doing when he sat quietly for ten minutes? A report from another Mind Control graduate provides a hint:

"I had an incredible experience yesterday in Bermuda. I had two hours to get on the plane back to New York and couldn't find my plane ticket anywhere. For almost an hour, three of us searched the apartment where Td been staying. We looked under carpets, behind the refrigerator—everywhere. I even unpacked and packed my suitcase three times, but no ticket was found.

Finally I decided to find myself a quiet corner and enter my level. 

No sooner was I at my level than I could 'see' my plane ticket as clearly as if I were ac-
tually looking at it. It was (according to my 'level' sight) in the bottom of a closet tucked in between some books, hardly noticeable. I rushed to the closet
and there was the ticket, just as I had imagined it!"
To those not trained in Mind Control, this sounds
incredible, but when you come to the chapters by Jose"
Silva, Mind Control's founder, you will learn of even
more amazing powers of your own mind. Perhaps most
amazing of all is how easily and quickly you can learn.
Mr. Silva has devoted most of his adult life to re-
search into what our minds can be trained to do. The
result is a 40-to-48-hour course that can train anyone to
remember what appears to be forgotten, to control pain, to speed healing, to abandon unwanted habits, to spark intuition so that the sixth sense becomes a creative,
problem-solving part of daily life. With all this comes a
cheerful inner peace, a quiet optimism based on first-
hand evidence that we are more in control of our lives
than we ever imagined.

Now for the first time through the printed word you can learn to practice much of what is taught in the course.

Mr. Silva has borrowed freely from both Eastern and Western learning, but the end product is quintessentially
American. The course, like its founder, is totally prac-
tical. Everything he teaches is designed to help you live
more happily, more effectively, here and now.
As you proceed from one exercise to another in the
chapters by Mr. Silva, you will pile one success on top
of another and so strengthen your confidence in your-
self that you will be ready for achievements which, as-
suming you are not acquainted with Mind Control, you
now regard as impossible. But there is scientific proof
that your mind is capable of miracles. In addition, there
is the successful experience of more than a half-million
people whose lives Mind Control has changed.

Imagine using your mind to improve your eyesight

"While taking my first course in Silva Mind Control Method, I began to notice that my eyes were changing —seemed stronger. 

Prior to this Pd worn glasses 10 years through childhood (till I graduated), then again
started when I was 38 Always my left eye was
said to be three times the weaker of the two.

"My first glasses in 1945 were reading glasses, but
in '48 or '49 I began wearing bifocals—correcting al-
ways to stronger. After the course I found that, while I
could not read without glasses, my eyes were certainly
stronger. Since they were changing so fast, I waited as14 / THE SILVA MIND CONTROL METHOD
long as possible before having them checked. I even
reverted to twenty-year-old glasses.
"When the local optometrist tested my eyes, he
agreed that the old pair would do much better until the
new lenses came."
This may seem mysterious to you now, but when you
read Chapter 10 you will see exactly how graduates put
their minds in charge of their bodies to speed up natural
healing. The techniques are amazingly simple, as you
will see in the following letter from a woman who lost
26 unwanted pounds in four months:
"First I visualized a dark frame and saw a table
loaded with ice cream, cake, etc.—all the things I knew
put the pounds on. I drew a large red X through the
table and saw myself in a mirror that made me look
very wide (the kind you find in a carnival fun house).
Next I visualized a scene surrounded by golden light: a
table on which all the high-protein foods rested—tuna
fish, eggs, lean meat. I placed a large golden check mark
on this scene and saw myself in a mirror looking very
tall and thin. Mentally I told myself that I craved only
the foods on the protein-laden table. I also heard all
my friends telling me how fantastic I looked and saw
all this happening on a specific date (this was the most
important step, because I set a goal for myself). And I
made it! Having been a chronic dieter, I find this the
only method that has worked."
This is Mind Control—going to a deep meditative
level where you can train your own mind to take
charge, using its own language of images reinforced
with words, bringing results that become more and more
amazing, with no end in sight for the person who keeps
in practice.
As you can see, this is no ordinary book. It will take
you in easy steps first into meditation, then into the
many ways you can use meditation until, when you
Introduction I 15
reach the final step, you can do routinely what most
people firmly believe cannot be done.
It is a book within a book. The outside book (chapters
1 and 2 and 17 through 20), by Philip Miele, de-
scribes the almost explosive growth of Mind Control and
how it has benefited many thousands of its graduates.
In the inside book, Mr. Silva shares with you many of
the techniques taught in Mind Control classes. Because
these classes are group experiences led by skilled lec-
turers, their results are speedier and more spectacular
than you will achieve working alone. However, if you
follow Mr. Silva's directions carefully and practice the
exercises, the results are virtually certain to transform
your life for the better—not as speedily, but just as
certainly.
There is a special way to read this book: first read it
as you would any other, from beginning to end. How-
ever, during your first reading, do not begin to practice
any of the exercises. Then reread chapters 3 to 14 to
get an even clearer, overall picture of the roads you are
about to travel. Next read Chapter 3 and practice the
exercises in it—and only those exercises—for a few
weeks. When you know you are ready, go on to Chap-
ter 4, and so on.
When you reach Chapter 14 you will already be an
experienced practitioner of much that Mind Control
graduates have learned. To further enrich your expe-
rience, you may wish to form a small group of friends
who have practiced the same exercises. Chapter 13 tells
you how to do this.
