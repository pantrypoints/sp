Political economy is an important division of the science of government. The object of government is the happiness of men, united in society. 

<!-- It seeks the means of securing to them the highest degree of felicity compatible with their nature, and at the same time of allowing the greatest possible number of individuals to partake in that felicity.  -->

But man is a complex being. He experiences moral and physical wants. Therefore his happiness has moral and physical aspects. 


## Moral Happiness

The moral happiness of man, so far as it depends on his government, is intimately connected with the improvement of that government. It is the object of civil policy.<!-- , which ought to diffuse the happy influence of liberty, knowledge, virtue, and hope, over all classes of the community. --> 

Civil policy should <!-- point out the means of giving to nations a constitution, the liberty of which may elevate the souls of the citizens; an education which may form their hearts to virtue and open their minds to knowledge; a religion which may present to them the hopes of another life, to compensate for the sufferings of this. -->  not seek what suits one man or one class of men, but what may impart most happiness <!-- by imparting most worth --> to all the men living under its laws.


## Physical Happiness

The aim of Political Economy is the physical well-being of man, so far as it can be produced by his government. 

Wealth:
- satisfies all the physical wants of man. 
- lets him command labour

Labor:
- purchases respectful service and procures all that man has accumulated for use or pleasure. 

<!-- By means of it health is preserved, and life maintained; the wants of infancy and old age are supplied; food, and clothing, and shelter, are placed within the reach of all.  -->

<!-- Wealth may therefore be considered as representing all that men can do for the physical well-being of each other; and the science which shows to governments the true system of administering national wealth is an important branch of the science of national happiness. -->

Government is instituted for its citizens. 
- It should the people's advantage perpetually in view

<!-- the advantage of all the Persons subject to it; hence it ought to keep the . And as in respect of  -->

Civil policy should:
- extend to every citizen the benefits of liberty, virtue, and knowledge. 
- watch over all the advantages of the national fortune. 

Government's aim is not to accumulate wealth in the state, but to make every citizen participate in those enjoyments, as represented by wealth. 
- Government is called to:
  - second the work of providence
  - augment the mass of felicity on earth
  - prevent the multiplication of its citizens faster than it can multiply their chances of happiness.

Wealth and population are not absolute signs of prosperity in a state. 
- They are only so in relation to each other. 
- Wealth is a blessing when it spreads comfort over all classes. 
- Population is an advantage when every man is sure of gaining an honest subsistence by his labour. 

But a country may be wretched if:
- only a few citizens are amassing colossal fortunes
- its population, like that of China, are more numerous than its food supply 
  - This causes the people to:
    - live on the refuse of animals
    - be incessantly threatened with famine
  - This is a calamity, and not an object of envy.

The improvement of social order is generally advantageous both to the poor and the rich. 

Political economy points out how to preserve this order by correction.

<!-- It was a beneficent decree of Providence, which gave wants and sufferings to human nature; because out of these it has formed the incitements, which are to awaken our activity, and push us forward to develop our whole being.  -->

<!-- If we could succeed in excluding pain from the world, we must also exclude virtue; if we could banish want, we must also banish industry. Hence it is not the equality of ranks, but happiness in all ranks, which the legislator ought to have in view. It is not from the division of property that he will procure this happiness, but from labour and the reward of labour. It is by maintaining the activity and hopes of the mind; by securing to the poor man as well as to the rich, a regular subsistence and the sweets of life, in the performance of his task. -->

Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations gave the most precise definition of that science.

The title given by Adam Smith to his immortal work, on the science we are now engaged with, 'The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations' forms at the same  

<!-- It presents a much more exact idea than the term political economy, afterwards adopted. The latter designation, at least, requires to be understood according to the modern acceptation of the word economy, not according to its etymology.  -->

Currently, economy means preserving, administering, and managing property. 

<!-- ; and it is because we use the somewhat tautological phrase domestic economy for the management of a private fortune, that we have come to use the phrase  -->

This leads to political economy for the management of the national fortune.

From the time when men first formed societies, they occupied themselves with the common interests originating in their wealth. 
- A portion of the public wealth was set apart to provide for the public wants. 

Finance is the levying and management of this national revenue. <!-- , which no longer pertained to each, became an essential part in the science of statesmen. It is what we call . -->

Private fortunes, on the other hand, made the interests of each citizen more complex. 

These were exposed to fraud and had to be defended by the public authority, according to the principle of the social contract. 

This social contract combined the strength of individuals to protect each other. 

The rights and rules over property led to civil jurisprudence. 

<!-- The application of justice to the distribution of national property, formed an essential function of the legislator. -->

But our ancestors had no inquiry on the nature and causes of national wealth. 
- They did not combine <!--  had not ascended to the principles of political economy, in order to deduce from that source their systems of --> finance and civil jurisprudence. <!-- , which ought, however, to be nothing more than corollaries from those principles.  -->
- They gave the development of public wealth to individuals, without examining their nature

In this way, property accumulated silently in each society by the labour of each artisan to procure his own subsistence. <!-- , and afterwards his own comforts - before the manner of acquiring and preserving it became an object of scientific speculation.  -->

The ancient philosophers:
- taught that riches are useless for happiness
- did not teach the laws to increase those riches

Philosophers started thinking about national wealth through:
- the requisitions of states, and
- the poverty of the people.
