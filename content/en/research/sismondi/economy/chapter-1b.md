In the 16th century, political power shifted to a few sovereigns who:
- overturned public liberty
- oppressed the smaller states
- destroyed the privileges of the towns and provinces
- controlled the national fortunes
- were absolutely ignorant of the industry that created and preserved wealth
 
Before the reign of Charles 5th, half of Europe was under the feudal system. It had:
- no liberty
- no knowledge
- no finance. 

The other half had already reached a high degree of prosperity through its increasing agricultural riches, factories, and trade. 
- It was governed by men who studied economy in private life when they were acquiring their own property
  - They had learned what is suitable in that of states
  - They governed free communities according to the interest of all.

Until the 15th century, wealth and credit were nowhere in:
- the republics of Italy
- the Hanseatic league
- the imperial towns of Germany
- the free towns of Belgium and Spain
- some towns in France and England

These instead enjoyed great municipal privileges. 

The Magistrates of all those towns were men constantly brought up in business. 
- They had no knowledge of political economy as a science
- Yet they had the feeling and experience of what would serve or injure the interests of their fellow-citizens.

The 19th century wars:
- overturned the balance of Europe
- transferred a nearly absolute monarchy to 4 all-powerful monarchs

Charles 5th united all the industrious and wealthy counties after having ruined them:
- Spain, nearly all Italy, Flanders, and Germany

He suppressed all their privileges and prevented the recovery of former opulence. 

<!-- The most absolute kings can no more govern by themselves, than kings whose authority is limited by laws.  -->

<!-- The former transmit their power to ministers whom they themselves select, in place of taking such as would be nominated by the popular confidence. But they find them among a class of persons different from that in which free governments find them. In the eyes of an absolute king, the first quality of a statesman is his being in possession of a rank so high that he may have lived in noble indolence, or at least in absolute ignorance of domestic economy.  -->

The ministers of Charles 5th: <!-- , whatever talents they show for negotiation and intrigue, --> 
- were all equally ignorant of pecuniary affairs
- ruined the public finances, agriculture, trade, and every kind of industry, from one end of Europe to the other
<!-- ; they made the people feel the difference, which might indeed have been anticipated, between their ignorance and the practical knowledge of republican magistrates. -->

The following monarchs wished to hold the balance between them:
- Charles 5th,
- his rival Francis 1st,
- Henry 8th

They spend more than they earned. 

<!--  the ambition nf their successors, and the obstinacy of the house of Austria, which continued to maintain a destructive system of warfare during more than a hundred years, caused those expenses, in spite of the public poverty, to go on increasing.  -->

As the suffering became more general, the humane people defended the poor. Thus, the science of political economy sprung from that of finance. 

<!--  f humanity felt more deeply the obligation laid on them to undertake the defence of the poor. By an order of sequence opposite to the natural progress of ideas,  -->

Philosophers:
- wished to shield the people from the speculations of absolute power
- felt that, to obtain a hearing from kings, they must speak to them of royal interests, not of justice or duty 
- investigated the nature and causes of national wealth, to show governments how it might be shared without being destroyed

Europe had too little liberty to allow those early <!--  who first occupied themselves with --> political economists to present their speculations

Finance were then enveloped in deep secrecy to know how it worked.  <!-- to admit of men, not engaged in public business, knowing facts enough to form the basis of general rules.  -->

This is why the study of political economy began with ministers who were interested in:
- finance and 
- the public interest 

<!-- when once it had fortunately happened that kings put men at the head of their finances, who combined talents with justice and love of the public weal.  -->

The 2 great French ministers were:
- Sully under Henry 4th
- Colbert under Louis 14th

They were the first who threw any light on the political economy which was then regarded as a secret of state. <!-- , in which mystery had engendered and concealed the greatest absurdities. --> 

Yet, in spite of all their genius and authority, they could not bring it any order, precision, or uniformity. 

<!--  into this branch of government. Both of them, however, not only repressed the frightful spoliations of the revenue farmers, and by their protection communicated some degree of security to private fortunes; but likewise dimly perceived the true sources of national prosperity, and busied themselves with efforts to make them flow more abundantly.  -->

Sully's policy was to protect agriculture. 

<!-- He used to say that pasturage and husbandry wee the two beasts of the state. --> 

Colbert's policy was to protect the merchants. 
- He descended from a family engaged in the cloth trade
- He studied to encourage manufactures and commerce.
- He asked the advice of merchants on all emergencies. 

Both statesmen:
- opened roads and canals to facilitate trade
- protected the spirit of enterprise
- honoured the industrious activity which diffused plenty over their country.
