Colbert came later than Sully. 
- He was the first to treat political economy as a science
- He reduced it to a body of doctrines as a uniform system of national wealth, probably suggested by merchants

<!-- - = he required one to give uniformity to his plans, and delineate clearly before his view the object he wished to attain.  -->

  - It was called the Mercantile System, also as Colbertism

 <!-- . Not that Colbert was its author, or unfolded it in any publication; but because he was beyond comparison the most illustrious of its professors; because, notwithstanding -->


The Mercantile System:
- was invented by merchants
- was adopted by all the ministers of absolute governments
- had errors, but its applications were very advantageous 

Colbert followed it without reforming it.

<!-- was the most talented of all Mercantile writers.  -->
<!-- ; and because, among the numerous writers who have maintained the same opinion, there is not one who has shown enough of talent even to fix his name in the reader's memory. It is but just, however, to separate the mercantile system altogether from the name of Colbert. It was a system invented by trading subjects, not by citizens; -->
<!-- , when they happened to take the trouble of thinking on finance, and Colbert had no other share in the matter than that of having followed it . -->

After hating commerce for a long time, governments finally discovered that it was one of the most abundant sources of national wealth. 

All the great fortunes in their states did not belong exclusively to merchants. But only the merchants could supply the states large sums during  sudden necessity. <!-- , they wished to levy large sums at once,  alone could supply them.  -->

Proprietors of land might possess immense revenues, manufacturers might cause immense labours to be executed; but neither of them could dispose of any more than their actual income or produce. 

In a case of need, merchants could offer their whole fortune to the government. 
- Their capital was entirely in consumable commodities
- They could sell these at an hour's warning and realise the required sum with smaller loss than any other class of citizens. 

Merchants therefore found means to make themselves be listened to because they:
- could command all the money in the state
- nearly independent of authority

They could conceal property, transport it with their persons to a foreign country at a moment's notice.

Governments would gladly increase the merchant's profit on condition of obtaining a share of it. 

Imagining that nothing more was necessary than to second each other's views, they offered him force to support industry. and since the advantage of the merchant consists in selling dear and buying cheap, they thought it would be an effectual protection to commerce, if the means were afforded of selling still dearer and buying still cheaper. 

The merchants whom they consulted eagerly accepted this proposal. 
- Thus was founded the mercantile system. 

The following rapacious inventors of so many monopolies had no other notion of political economy: 
- Antonio de Leyva
- Fernando de Gonnzago
- the Duke of Alva, viceroys of Charles V and his descendants


A more honourable basis for such transactions were called for when:
- this methodical robbery of consumers was needed to be systematized
- Colbert consulted corporations
- the people finally perceived what was happening

It became necessary to study the advantage of financiers and merchants and the nation. 

The calculations of self-interest cannot show themselves in open day. The first benefit of publicity is to impose silence on base sentiments.

Under these circumstances, the mercantile system was moulded into a plausible form.

<!-- doubtless it must have been plausible, since, even till our own times, it continued to seduce the greater part of practical men employed in trade and finance.  -->

Those earliest economists said that wealth is money. 
- 'Wealth' and 'money' were used so universally as to be almost entirely synonymous. 

<!-- No one dreamed of questioning the identity of money and wealth.  -->

<!-- Money, they said, disposes of men's labour and of all its fruits. It is money which produces those fruits; it is by means of money that industry continues in a nation; to its influence each individual owes his subsistence and the continuation of his life.  -->

<!-- Money is especially necessary in the relation of one state to another.  -->

<!-- It supports war and forms the strength of armies. The state which has it, rules over that which has it not. The whole science of political economy ought, therefore, to have for its object the increase of money in a nation. But the money possessed by a nation cannot be augmented in quantity, except by the working of mines, if the nation has any; or by foreign trade, if it has none. All the exchanges carried on within a country, all the purchases and sales which take place among Englishmen, for instance, do not increase the specie contained within the shores of England by a single penny. 

Hence it is necessary to And means of importing money from other countries; and trade alone can do this by selling much to foreigners and buying little from them.  -->

<!-- For in the same way as each merchant in settling with his correspondent, sees at the year's end whether he has sold more than he has bought, and Ands himself accordingly creditor or debtor by a balance account which must be paid in money; so likewise a nation, by summing up all its purchases and all its sales with each nation, or with all together, would find itself every year creditor or debtor by a commercial balance which must be paid in money. If the country pay this balance, it will constantly grow poorer; if it receive the balance, it will constantly grow richer. -->

For a century, the mercantile system was universally:
- adopted by cabinets
- favoured by traders and chambers of commerce
- expounded by writers

<!-- , as if it had been proved by the most unexceptionable demonstration, no one deeming it worth while to establish it by new proofs; when,  -->
