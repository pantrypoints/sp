description: "Political economists must always take 2 elements together"
---



<!-- We have defined political economy, as being the investigation of the means, by which the greatest number of men in a given state may participate in the highest degree of physical happiness, so far as it depends on government.  -->

Political economists must always take 2 elements together: <!--  must always be received in connexion by the legislature; --> 

1. The increase of happiness in intensity
2. Its diffusion among all classes of people

**This makes the political economy the theory of beneficence.** Everything which does not concern happiness in the long run does not belong to this science.

The human race originated in a single family. 

It has multiplied, and spread itself over the globe. A lot of time was needed for it to adjust to the means of subsistence possible in the different parts of this globe<!--  are capable of supplying -->. This work of nature is repeated:
- in new counties, or 
- in a colony established in a desert 

<!-- A state which passes from barbarism into civilization cannot suddenly have as many inhabitants as it may comfortably support. The earth has been wasted several times; as the greater part of its provinces has been by turns plunged into a state of desolation, to arise from it slowly afterwards, we have often had the opportunity of witnessing this spectacle of a growing population. --> 

We often see large populations as the mark of prosperity and good government. This is why our law and constitution all tend to favour this increase even if the symptoms of prosperity are very different from cause of that prosperity.

<!-- Nature has attended to the multiplication of races with a kind of profusion. Although that of man is among the slowest in its progress, it may increase, when all circumstances are favourable, far more quickly than any of our observations indicate.  -->

<!-- When every man has a great interest in bringing up a family, and has the means of doing so; when all marry, and all as young as nature permits; when they -->

Humans can continue to have children until old age. Their posterity increases which quickly occupies all the allotted space. 

In several counties, in consequence of the social organization, not more than 25% of the people marry. The rest grow old in celibacy. Yet this 25% is enough to keep up the population at the same level. 

If their brothers and sisters could also marry with the same advantage, the population would be quadrupled in a single generation.

Thus, every nation very soon becomes populous<!--  arrives at the degree of population which it can attain --> without changing its social institutions. It soon arrives at the population limit which its revenue can support. <!-- counting as many individuals as it can maintain with a revenue so limited, and so distributed. --> 

A great transient calamity, a war, a pestilence, a famine might reduce <!-- , have left a great void in --> the population. But if <!-- , should those events be --> these are followed by a period of general security and comfort, this renewing power of human generation is speedily developed. <!--  and an observer is astonished to see how few years are required to obliterate all traces of a scourge, which seemed to have unpeopled the earth.  -->

But, on the other hand, so soon as this term has been reached, a greater increase of the population is a national calamity; the earth soon consumes those whom it cannot feed. 

But the more numerous births are, the more will mortality display its ravages, to maintain constantly the same level. This mortality, the effect of misery and suffering, is preceded by the lengthened punishments not of those who perish only, but of those who have struggled with them for existence.

In every country, it is essential to know well those different periods of increase, stagnation, and decline in order to adapt the laws and social institutions. But too frequently, the laws hasten the destruction which we fear.

<!--  as land proper for liberally rewarding rural labour is covered only with spontaneous production; as even the part under tillage is imperfectly worked; as the soil is not rendered healthy, the marshes drained, the hills protected against precipitations, the fields defended against the ruinous force of nature; so long as all this is not done merely for want of hands - it is desirable for the happiness of agriculturists, and for that of the nation living on their labour, that  -->

The class of cultivators should be increased and enabled to accomplish cultivation whenever:
- most of the country is uncultivated, or
- the land is undeveloped

The manufacturing population should increase whenever:
- manufactures are imperfectly supplied to the consumer, or
- manufactures are expensive 

<!--  at least as he cannot procure them except by a sacrifice quite disproportionate to their value; so long as he is constrained to furnish himself coarsely by domestic industry, for want of opportunity to buy furniture, effects, clothes, proper for his use; so long as his enjoyments are restricted by the inconveniences of all the utensils with which he is obliged to content himself, - it is desirable that  -->
<!-- ; since, from the need there is of such a population, it might evidently live in comfort, and contribute to the enjoyment of other classes. -->

The population of the guardian professions should increase whenever the general population increases. 

<!-- So long as all hands are in such a degree necessary for agriculture, and manufactures, or trade which serves them, that 
, equally useful to society, are badly filled up - it is desirable that population continue to increase, that so interior order, security of person and property, may be better protected, health better attended to, the soul better nourished, the mind more enlightened; and that society may be externally defended with sufficient force, comprehending even the rapid recruitment of a sea or land army, which consume population. -->

This population will quickly be replaced. But it is not enough that it be replaced, if it cannot find the niche, to which it is destined. 

Sometimes a fertile soil is in vain abundant, and remains uncultivated. There is no chance of the most numerous population assembled in its neighbourhood coming to profit by its resources. This soil has become the property of a few families; it is declared indivisible and unalienable; it will always pass to a single proprietor, according to the order of primogeniture, without the capacity either to be subjected to an emphyteutic lease, or burdened with a mortgage. 

The proprietor has not the capital necessary for its cultivation; he can give no security to such as have this capital, that will engage them to employ it in his land. 

Thus the idle population of Rome in vain calls for labour; the waste Campagna di Roma in vain calls for labourers; the social organization is bad; and so long as this shall remain unchanged, the day-labourer will perish from penury, on the surface of fields which, for want of culture, are returning to their wild state; and the population, far from increasing, will diminish.

On the same principle in manufactures, the rich proprietors of Poland will in vain require all the produce of luxury; the bad condition of the roads, prohibiting every distant transport, will in vain present superior advantages to national industry; oppression and servitude destroy all energy, all spirit of enterprise in the lower class. 

Elsewhere ruinous monopolies, absurd privileges, affrighting advances, ignorance, barbarity, and want of security, will render the progress of manufactures impossible; no capital will be accumulated to animate them. In those cases, to increase the population will not increase industry. 

The births will in vain be doubled, be quadrupled, during a certain number of years; they will not afford an additional workman, they will only be followed by a proportionably quicker mortality. The social organization is bad; so long as this shall remain unchanged, population cannot increase.

The guardian population is fed as well as recruited by the other classes. It is not sufficient that many children are born; unless their parents enjoy a certain degree of opulence, they can never bring them up to the age of men; the prince can never make soldiers of them. In this case, wars by land or sea will devour the population; whilst they employ only its superfluity, the social organization is good.

The population is always measured, in the long run, by the demand for labour. 

Wherever labour is required, and a sufficient wage offered, the workmen will arise to earn it. The population, with its expansive force, will occupy the place which is found vacant. Subsistence will also arise for the workmen, or in case of need, be imported. The same demand which calls a man into existence, will likeWise recompense the agricultural labour which provides him with food. If the demand for labour cease, the workman will perish, yet not without a struggle, in which not he alone will suffer, but all his brethren and his rivals. 

The subsistence which enabled him to live, and which henceforth he cannot pay for, and cannot demand, will, in its turn, cease to be produced. Thus national happiness rests on the demand for labour, but on a regular and perpetual demand. For, on the contrary, a demand which is intermittent, after having formed workmen, condemns them to suffering and death= it would be far better if they never had existed.

We have seen that the demand for labour, the cause of production, must be proportional to revenue which supports consumption; that this revenue, in its turn, originates in the national wealth, which wealth is formed and augmented by labour. 

Thus, in political economy, all things are linked together. We move constantly in a circle since each effect becomes a cause in its turn.

Yet all things are progressive, provided that each movement is adjusted to the rest. But all stops, all retrogrades, whenever one of the movements which ought to be combined is disordered. 

According to the natural march of things, an augmentation of wealth will produce an augmentation of revenue; from this will arise an increase of consumption, next an increase of labour for reproduction, and therewith of population; and, finally, this new labour will, in its turn, increase the national wealth. 

But if, by unreasonable measures, any one of those operations is hastened without regard to all the rest, the whole system is deranged, and the poor are weighed down with suffering, instead of the happiness which was anticipated for them.

The object of society is not fulfilled, so long as the country occupied by this society, presents means of supporting a new population, of enabling it to live in happiness and abundance, whilst yet those means are not resorted to. The multiplication of happiness over the earth, is the object of Providence; it is stamped in all his works, and the duty of men in their human society is to co-operate in it.

A government condemns fertile counties to be deserts and sins against human society when it oppresses them through:
- its contempt for justice and order
- the shackles it puts on agriculture and industry

<!-- its tyranny is a crime against human society, on the whole of which it inflicts suffering; it weakens its rights over the country occupied by it, and as it troubles the enjoyments of all other states, it gives to all others the right of controlling it. All men are mutually necessary to each other.  -->

Europe has a double need of the subsistence which it might procure from Barbary, if this magnificent shore of Africa were given back to civilization, and from the consumers we should soon find there. The institution of property is the result of social conventions. In a society subjected to laws and a regulating government, the interest of each may be implicitly relied on for producing the advantage of all, because the aberrations of this private interest are, in every case of need, limited by public authority. 

But, in the great human society formed among independent nations, there is no law or general government to repress the passions of each sovereign= besides, the interest of those sovereigns is not necessarily conformable to that of their subjects; or, to speak more correctly, the one is contrary to the other, whenever the object of the rulers is to maintain their tyranny. 

Thus respect for the pretended right of properly claimed by each government over its territory, is not referrible to the right of private property, and, besides, it cannot be reciprocal. The same circumstances which cause a tyrannical government to impede its own civilization, render it equally incapable of respecting that of its neighbours, and submitting to the laws of nations.

But whilst more than three quarters of the habitable globe are, by the faults of their governments, deprived of the inhabitants they should support, we, at the present day, in almost the whole of Europe, experience the opposite calamity, that of not being able to maintain a superabundant population, which surpasses the proportion of labour required, and which, before dying of poverty, will diffuse its sufferings over the whole class of such as live by the labour of their hands. 

For our part, we owe this calamity to the imprudent zeal of our governments.

With us, religious instruction, legislation, social organization, every thing has tended to produce a population, the existence of which was not provided for beforehand. The labour was not adjusted to the number of men; and, frequently, the same zeal with which it was attempted to multiply the number of births, was afterwards employed, in all arts, to diminish the required number of hands. The proportion which should subsist in the progress of the different departments of society has been broken, and the suffering has become universal.

Malthus was the first to awaken public attention to this calamity.

But he:
- gave an alarm to legislators
- did not reach the true principles he was seeking

His reasoning has an essential error.

Such confusion, in a matter to which the happiness of man is attached, may produce the most fatal consequences. 

By rigorously applying principles deficient in accuracy, the most grievous errors may be committed.

If the error is discovered, there is a risk of simultaneously rejecting both the observations and the precepts.

He established as a principle that the population of every country is limited by the quantity of food which that country can furnish.

This is true only when applied to:
- the whole globe, or
- a country which has no trade

In all other cases, foreign trade modifies it.

<!-- More importantly, this proposition is but abstractly true, - true in a manner inapplicable to political economy.  -->

The truth is that a population has never reached the limit of subsistence, and probably it never will.

**Long before the population can be arrested by the inability of the country to produce more food, it is arrested by the inability of the population to purchase that food, or to labour in producing it.**

Malthus says that the whole population of a state may be doubled every 25 years, following a geometrical progression.

But the labour employed to meliorate a soil, already in culture, can add to its produce nothing but quantities continually decreasing. 

During the first 25 years, the produce of land has been doubled.

In the second we shall scarcely succeed in compelling it to produce a half more, then a third more, then a fourth.

Thus the progress of subsistence will not follow the geometrical, but the arithmetical progression.

After 2 centuries, whilst the population increases, as the numbers, 1. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, subsistence will increase not faster than the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

But I argue that this is completely sophistical.

It opposes the possible increase of the human population, considered abstractly, and without regarding circumstances, to the positive increase of animals and vegetables in a confined place, under circumstances more and more unfavourable. 

They should not be compared.
