Cleanthes and the other Stoical philosophers had a system of their own.

They:
- rejected the doctrine of the Solid Spheres
- maintained that the celestial regions were filled with a fluid ether, of too yielding a nature to carry along with it, by any motion of its own, bodies so immensely great as the Sun, Moon, and Five
Planets. 

These, therefore, as well as the Fixed Stars, did not derive their motion from the circumambient body, but had each of them, in itself, and peculiar to itself, a vital principle of motion, which directed it to move with its own peculiar velocity, and its own peculiar direction. 

It was by this internal principle, that the Fixed Stars revolved directly from east to west in circles parallel to the Equator, greater or less, according to their distance or nearness to the Poles, and with velocities so proportioned, that each of them finished its diurnal period in the same time, in something less than 23 hours and 56 minutes.

It was, by a principle of the same kind, that the Sun moved westwards, for they allowed of no eastward motion in the heavens, but with less velocity than the Fixed Stars, so as to finish his diurnal period in 24 hours, and, consequently, to fall every day behind them, by a space of the heavens nearly
equal to that which he passes over in four minutes; that is, nearly equal to a degree.

This revolution of the Sun, too, was neither directly westwards, nor exactly circular; but after the Summer Solstice, his motion began gradually to incline a little southwards, appearing in his meridian to–day, further south than yesterday; and to–morrow still further south than to–day; and thus continuing every day to describe a spiral line round the Earth, which carried him gradually further and further southwards, till he arrived at the Winter Solstice. 

Here, this spiral line began to change its direction, and to bring him gradually, every day, further and further northwards, till it again restored him to the Summer Solstice. In the same manner they accounted for the motion of the Moon, and that of the Five Planets, by supposing that each of them revolved westwards, but with directions, and velocities, that were both different from one another, and continually varying; generally, however, in spherical lines, somewhat inclined to the Equator.

This system seems never to have had the vogue. 

The system of Concentric as well as that of Eccentric Spheres gives some sort of reason, both for the constancy and equability of the motion of the Fixed Stars, and for the variety and uncertainty of that of the Planets. 

Each of them bestow some sort of coherence upon those apparently
disjointed phaenomena. But this other system seems to leave them pretty much as it
found them. 

Ask a Stoic: Why do all the Stars revolve daily in circles of different diameters parallel to each other and with speeds so proportioned, that they all finish their period at the same time, and preserve the same distance and location with regard to one another? 

He can only answer that the peculiar nature or caprice of each Star directs it to move in that peculiar manner. 

His system affords him no principle of connection, by which he can join together, in his imagination, so great a number of harmonious revolutions. 

But either of the other two systems, by the supposition of the solid firmament, affords this easily. He is equally at a loss to connect together the peculiarities that are observed in the motions of the other heavenly bodies; 

the spiral motion of them all; their alternate progression from north to south, and from south to north; the sometimes accelerated, and again retarded motions of the Sun and Moon; the direct retrograde and stationary appearances of the Planets. 

All these have, in his system, no bond of union, but remain as loose and incoherent in the fancy, as they at first appeared to the senses, before philosophy had attempted, by giving them a new arrangement, by placing them at different distances, by assigning to each some peculiar but regular principle of motion, to methodize and dispose them into an order that should enable the imagination to pass as smoothly, and with as little embarrassment, along them, as along the most regular, familiar, and coherent appearances of nature.

<!-- Such were the systems of Astronomy that, in the ancient world, appear to have been
adopted by any considerable party. Of all of them, the system of Eccentric Spheres was
that which corresponded most exactly with the appearances of the heavens. It was not
invented till after those appearances had been observed, with some accuracy, for more
than a century together; and it was not completely digested by Ptolemy till the reign of

after a much longer course of observations. We cannot wonder, therefore,
Antoninus,
that it was adapted to a much greater number of the phaenomena, than either of the
other two systems, which had been formed before those phaenomena were observed
with any degree of attention, which, therefore, could connect them together only while
they were thus regarded in the gross, but which, it could not be expected, should apply
to them when they came to be considered in the detail. From the time of Hipparchus,
therefore, this system seems to have been pretty generally received by all those who
attended particularly to the study of the heavens. That astronomer first made a

calculated, for six hundred years, the revolutions of the
catalogue of the Fixed Stars;
Sun, Moon, and Five Planets; marked the places in the heavens, in which, during all that
period, each of those bodies should appear; ascertained the times of the eclipses of the
Sun and Moon, and the particular places of the Earth in which they should be visible. His
calculations were founded upon this system, and as the events corresponded to his
predictions, with a degree of accuracy which, though inferior to what Astronomy has
since arrived at, was greatly superior to any thing which the world had then known,
they ascertained, to all astronomers and mathematicians, the preference of his system,
above all those which had been current before it.
17
It was, however, to astronomers and mathematicians only, that they ascertained this;
for, notwithstanding the evident superiority of this system, to all those with which the
world was then acquainted, it was never adopted by any one sect of philosophers.
18
Philosophers, long before the days of Hipparchus, seem to have abandoned the study of
nature,
27
to employ themselves chiefly in ethical, rhetorical, and dialectical questions.

Each party of them too, had by this time completed their peculiar system or theory of the universe, and no human consideration could then have induced them to give up any part of it. That supercilious and ignorant contempt too, with which at this time they regarded all mathematicians, among whom they counted astronomers, seems even to have hindered them from enquiring so far into their doctrines, as to know what opinions they held.

Neither Cicero nor Seneca, who have so often occasion to mention
the ancient systems of Astronomy, take any notice of that of Hipparchus. His name is
not to be found in the writings of Seneca. It is mentioned but once in those of Cicero, in but without any note of approbation, as a geographer, and not as
a letter to Atticus,
an astronomer. Plutarch, when he counts up, in his second book, concerning the

never mentions this,
opinions of philosophers, all the ancient systems of Astronomy,
the only tolerable one which was known in his time. Those three authors, it seems,
31
indeed, a man
conversed only with the writings of philosophers. The elder Pliny
whose curiosity extended itself equally to every part of learning, describes the system of
Hipparchus, and never mentions its author, which he has occasion to do often, without
some note of that high admiration which he had so justly conceived for his merit. Such
32
in those professed instructors of mankind, with regard to so
profound ignorance
important a part of the learning of their own times, is so very remarkable, that I
thought it deserved to be taken notice of, even in this short account of the revolutions
of philosophy.

to perform, as well as to connect together, in reality, those different movements and
effects which the artist has occasion for. A system is an imaginary machine invented to
connect together in the fancy those different movements and effects which are already
in reality performed. The machines that are first invented to perform any particular
movement are always the most complex, and succeeding artists generally discover that,
with fewer wheels, with fewer principles of motion, than had originally been employed,

manner, are always the most complex, and a particular connecting chain, or principle, is
generally thought necessary to unite every two seemingly disjointed appearances: but it
often happens, that one great connecting principle is afterwards found to be sufficient to
bind together all the discordant phaenomena that occur in a whole species of things.
How many wheels are necessary to carry on the movements of this imaginary machine,
the system of Eccentric Spheres! The westward diurnal revolution of the Firmament,
whose rapidity carries all the other heavenly bodies along with it, requires one. The
periodical eastward revolutions of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, require, for each of
those bodies, another. Their differently accelerated and retarded motions require, that
those wheels, or circles, should neither be concentric with the Firmament, nor with one
another; which, more than any thing, seems to disturb the harmony of the universe.
The retrograde and stationary appearance of the Five Planets, as well as the extreme
inconstancy of the Moon’s motion, require, for each of them, an Epicycle, another little
wheel attached to the circumference of the great wheel, which still more interrupts the
uniformity of the system. The motion of the apogeum of each of those bodies requires,
in each of them, still another wheel, to carry the centres of their Eccentric Spheres
round the centre of the Earth. And thus, this imaginary machine, though, perhaps, more
simple, and certainly better adapted to the phaenomena than the Fifty–six Planetary
Spheres of Aristotle, was still too intricate and complex for the imagination to rest in it
with complete tranquillity and satisfaction. -->

It maintained its authority, however, without any diminution of reputation, as long as science was at all regarded in the ancient world. 


Hipparchus lived almost 300 years before Antoninus.

After the reign of Antoninus and the age of Hipparchus, the earlier philosophers had great reputation in the imaginations of mankind.

<!-- , that they seem to have despaired of ever equalling their renown. All human wisdom, they supposed, was comprehended in the writings of those elder sages.  -->

To abridge, to explain, and to comment upon them, and thus show themselves, at least, capable of understanding some of their sublime mysteries, became now the only probable road to reputation. 

Proclus and Theon wrote tried to invent a new system of astronomy against the System of Ptolemy. But they were regarded as impious to the memory of their so much revered predecessors.
