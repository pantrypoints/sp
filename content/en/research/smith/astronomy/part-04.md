The ruin of Roman Empire produced the entire neglect of the study of Nature. 

The empire of the Caliphs established the peace required by the sciences. 

It was under the protection of those generous and magnificent princes, that the ancient philosophy and astronomy of the Greeks were restored and established in the East.


<!-- just, and religious government diffused over their vast
tranquillity, which their mild,
empire, revived the curiosity of mankind, to inquire into the connecting principles of
nature. The fame of the Greek and Roman learning, which was then recent in the
memories of men, made them desire to know, concerning these abstruse subjects, what
were the doctrines of the so much renowned sages of those two nations. -->

They translated the following Greek works into Arabic and studied them eagerly:
- Aristotle
- Ptolemy
- Hippocrates
- Galen

<!-- The superiority which they easily discovered in them, above
39
the rude essays which their own nation
had yet had time to produce, and which were
such, we may suppose, as arise every where in the first infancy of science, necessarily
determined them to embrace their systems, particularly that of Astronomy: neither were
they ever afterwards able to throw off their authority. For, though the munificence of
the Abassides, the second race of the Califfs, is said to have supplied the Arabian
astronomers with larger and better instruments, than any that were known to Ptolemy
and Hipparchus, the study of the sciences seems, in that mighty empire, to have been
either of too short, or too interrupted a continuance, to allow them to make any
considerable correction in the doctrines of those old mathematicians. The imaginations
of mankind had not yet got time to grow so familiar with the ancient systems, as to
regard them without some degree of that astonishment which their grandeur and
novelty excited; a novelty of a peculiar kind, which had at once the grace of what was
new, and the authority of what was ancient. They were still, therefore, too much
enslaved to those systems, to dare to depart from them, when those confusions which shook, and at last overturned the peaceful throne of the Califfs, banished the study of
the sciences from that empire. They had, however, before this, made some considerable
improvements: they had measured the obliquity of the Ecliptic, with more accuracy than
had been done before. The tables of Ptolemy had, by the length of time, and by the
inaccuracy of the observations upon which they were founded, become altogether wide
of what was the real situation of the heavenly bodies, as he himself indeed had foretold
they would do. It became necessary, therefore, to form new ones, which was

measured two degrees of its circumference. -->


The victorious Saracens carried into Spain the learning and gallantry of the East, together with:

- the Arabian translations of Ptolemy and Aristotle

Thus Europe received a second time, from Babylon, the rudiments of Astronomy.

The doctrine of the Solid Spheres had, originally, been invented, in order to give a
physical account of the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, according to the system of
Concentric Circles, to which that doctrine was very easily accommodated. Those
mathematicians who invented the doctrine of Eccentric Circles and Epicycles, contented
themselves with showing, how, by supposing the heavenly bodies to revolve in such
orbits, the phaenomena might be connected together, and some sort of uniformity and
coherence be bestowed upon their real motions. The physical causes of those motions
they left to the consideration of the philosophers; though, as appears from some
passages of Ptolemy, they had some general apprehension, that they were to be

all astronomers and mathematicians, it never was received, as we have already
observed, by any one sect of philosophers among the ancients. No attempt, therefore,
seems to have been made amongst them, to accommodate to it any such hypothesis.
25
The schoolmen, who received, at once, from the Arabians, the philosophy of Aristotle,
and the astronomy of Hipparchus, were necessarily obliged to reconcile them to one
another, and to connect together the revolutions of the Eccentric Circles and Epicycles of
the one, by the solid Spheres of the other. Many different attempts of this kind were
45
in the
made by many different philosophers: but, of them all, that of Purbach,
fifteenth century, was the happiest and the most esteemed. Though his hypothesis is
the simplest of any of them, it would be in vain to describe it without a scheme; neither
is it easily intelligible with one: for, if the system of Eccentric Circles and Epicycles was
before too perplexed and intricate for the imagination to rest in it, with complete
tranquillity and satisfaction, it became much more so, when this addition had been
made to it. The world, justly indeed, applauded the ingenuity of that philosopher, who
could unite, so happily, two such seemingly inconsistent systems. His labours, however,
seem rather to have increased than to have diminished the causes of that

dissatisfaction, which the learned soon began to feel with the system of Ptolemy. He, as
well as all those who had worked upon the same plan before him, by rendering this
account of things more complex, rendered it still more embarrassing than it had been
before.
26
Neither was the complexness of this system the sole cause of the dissatisfaction, which
the world in general began, soon after the days of Purbach, to express for it. The tables
of Ptolemy having, upon account of the inaccuracy of the observations on which they
were founded, become altogether wide of the real situation of the heavenly bodies,
46
in the ninth century, were, upon the same hypothesis, composed
those of Almamon,
to correct their deviations. These again, a few ages afterwards, became, for the same
reason, equally useless. In the thirteenth century, Alphonsus, the philosophical king of
47
Castile,
found it necessary to give orders for the composition of those tables, which
bear his name. It is he, who is so well known for the whimsical impiety of using to say,
that, had he been consulted at the creation of the universe, he could have given good
advice; an apophthegm which is supposed to have proceeded from his dislike to the
intricate system of Ptolemy. In the fifteenth century, the deviation of the Alphonsine
tables began to be as sensible, as those of Ptolemy and Almamon had been before. It
appeared evident, therefore, that, though the system of Ptolemy might, in the main, be
true, certain corrections were necessary to be made in it before it could be brought to

Eccentric Circles and Epicycles, supposing them to exist, could not, it was evident, be
precisely such as he represented them; since the revolutions of the heavenly bodies
deviated, in a short time, so widely from what the most exact calculations, that were
founded upon his hypothesis, represented them. It had plainly, therefore, become
necessary to correct, by more accurate observations, both the velocities and directions
of all the wheels and circles of which his hypothesis is composed. This, accordingly, was
49
the disciple, the continuator,
begun by Purbach, and carried on by Regiomontanus,
and the perfecter of the system of Purbach; and one, whose untimely death, amidst
innumerable projects for the recovery of old, and the invention and advancement of new
sciences, is, even at this day, to be regretted.
27
When you have convinced the world, that an established system ought to be corrected,
it is not very difficult to persuade them that it should be destroyed. Not long, therefore,
after the death of Regiomontanus, Copernicus began to meditate a new system, which
should connect together the celestial appearances, in a more simple as well as a more
accurate manner, than that of Ptolemy. -->



The motion of the Equalizing Circle represented the revolutions of the Celestial Spheres. But it was  equable only when surveyed from a point that was different from their centers.

This introduced a real inequality into their motions, contrary to that most natural and fundamental idea which the former astronomers have aimed for. 

This prompted Copernicus to create a new system that was more accurate than that of Ptolemy. 

He rearranged the planets so that there would be regularity in their motions. To do this he looked back at all the principles of previous astronomers. 




<!--  with which all the
authors of astronomical systems, Plato, Eudoxus, Aristotle, even Hipparchus and
The confusion, in which the old hypothesis represented the motions of the heavenly
what first suggested to him the design of forming a new
bodies, was, he tells us,
system, that these, the noblest works of nature, might no longer appear devoid of that
harmony and proportion which discover themselves in her meanest productions. What
most of all dissatisfied him, was, the motion of the Equalizing Circle, which, by
representing the revolutions of the Celestial Spheres, as equable only, when surveyed
from a point that was different from their centers, introduced a real inequality into their
motions; contrary to that most natural, and indeed fundamental idea, with which all the
authors of astronomical systems, Plato, Eudoxus, Aristotle, even Hipparchus and
Ptolemy themselves, had hitherto set out, that the real motions of such beautiful and
divine objects must necessarily be perfectly regular, and go on, in a manner, as
agreeable to the imagination, as the objects themselves are to the senses. He began to
consider, therefore, whether, by supposing the heavenly bodies to be arranged in a
different order from that in which Aristotle and Hipparchus had placed them, this so
much sought for uniformity might not be bestowed upon their motions. To discover this
arrangement, he examined all the obscure traditions delivered down to us, concerning
every other hypothesis which the ancients had invented, for the same purpose.  -->

He found in Plutarch that some old Pythagoreans had represented the Earth as revolving around its own axis as the center of the universe.
  <!-- in the centre of the universe, like a wheel around its own axis. -->

Other Pythagoreans had removed it from the centre, and represented it as revolving in the Ecliptic like a star around the central fire. 

He supposed that this central fire was the Sun.



<!-- ; and though in this he was very widely mistaken,
interpretation, that he began to consider how such an hypothesis might be made to
correspond to the appearances. The supposed authority of those old philosophers, if it
did not originally suggest to him his system, seems, at least, to have confirmed him in
an opinion, which, it is not improbable, that he had before–hand other reasons for
embracing, notwithstanding what he himself would affirm to the contrary. -->

It then occurred to him, that, if the Earth rotates every day around its axis, from west to east, then all the heavenly bodies would appear to revolve, in a contrary direction, from east to west. 

The diurnal revolution of the heavens, upon this hypothesis, might be only apparent.

The firmament, which has no other sensible motion, might be perfectly at rest.

The Sun, the Moon, and the Five Planets, might have no other movement beside that eastward revolution, which is peculiar to themselves. 

That, by supposing the Earth to revolve with the Planets, around the Sun, in an orbit, which comprehended within it the orbits of Venus and Mercury, but was comprehended within those of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, he could, without the embarrassment of Epicycles, connect together the apparent annual revolutions of the Sun, and the direct, retrograde, and stationary appearances of the Planets.

While the Earth really revolved round the Sun on one side of the heavens, the Sun would appear to revolve round the Earth on the other; that while she really advanced in her annual course, he would appear to advance eastward in that movement which is peculiar to himself. 

That, by supposing the axis of the Earth to be always parallel to itself, not to be quite perpendicular, but somewhat inclined to the plane of her orbit, and consequently to present to the Sun, the one pole when on the one side of him, and the other when on the other, he would account for the obliquity of the Ecliptic; the Sun’s seemingly alternate progression from north to south, and from south to north, the consequent change of the seasons, and different lengths of days and nights in the different seasons.

If this new hypothesis thus connected together all these appearances as happily as that of Ptolemy, there were others which it connected together much better. 

The 3 superior Planets, when nearly in conjunction with the Sun, appear always at the greatest distance from the Earth, are smallest, and least sensible to the eye, and seem to revolve forward in their direct motion with the greatest rapidity. 

On the contrary, when in opposition to the Sun, that is, when in their meridian about midnight, they appear nearest the Earth, are largest, and most sensible to the eye, and seem to revolve backwards in their retrograde motion. 

To explain these appearances, the system of Ptolemy supposed each of the these Planets to be at the upper part of their several Epicycles, in the one case; and at the lower, in the other. 

But it afforded no satisfactory principle of connection, which could lead the mind easily to conceive how the Epicycles of those Planets, whose spheres were so distant from the sphere of the Sun, should thus, if one may say so, keep time to his motion. 

The system of Copernicus afforded this easily, and like a more simple machine, without the assistance of Epicycles, connected together, by fewer movements, the complex appearances of the heavens.
When the superior Planets appear nearly in conjunction with the Sun, they are then in
the side of their orbits, which is almost opposite to, and most distant from the Earth,
and therefore appear smallest, and least sensible to the eye. But, as they then revolve
in a direction which is almost contrary to that of the Earth, they appear to advance
forward with double velocity; as a ship, that sails in a contrary direction to another,
appears from that other, to sail both with its own velocity, and the velocity of that from
which it is seen. 

On the contrary, when those Planets are in opposition to the Sun, they are on the same side of the Sun with the Earth, are nearest it, most sensible to the eye, and revolve in the same direction with it; but, as their revolutions round the Sun are slower than that of the Earth, they are necessarily left behind by it, and therefore seem to revolve backwards; as a ship which sails slower than another, though it sails in the same direction, appears from that other to sail backwards. After the same manner, by the same annual revolution of the Earth, he connected together the direct and
retrograde motions of the two inferior Planets, as well as the stationary appearances of
all the Five.

There are some other particular phaenomena of the two inferior Planets, which correspond still better to this system, and still worse to that of Ptolemy. 

Venus and Mercury seem to attend constantly upon the motion of the Sun, appearing, sometimes
on the one side, and sometimes on the other, of that great luminary; Mercury being
almost always buried in his rays, and Venus never receding above forty–eight degrees
from him, contrary to what is observed in the other three Planets, which are often seen
in the opposite side of the heavens, at the greatest possible distance from the Sun. The
system of Ptolemy accounted for this, by supposing that the centers of the Epicycles of
these two Planets were always in the same line with those of the Sun and the Earth;
that they appeared therefore in conjunction with the Sun, when either in the upper or
lower part of their Epicycles, and at the greatest distance from him, when in the sides of
them. It assigned, however, no reason why the Epicycles of these two Planets should
observe so different a rule from that which takes place in those of the other three, nor
for the enormous Epicycle of Venus, whose sides must have been forty–eight degrees
distant from the Sun, while its center was in conjunction with him, and whose diameter
must have covered more than a quadrant of the Great Circle. But how easily all these
appearances coincide with the hypothesis, which represents those two inferior Planets
revolving round the Sun in orbits comprehended within the orbit of the Earth, is too
obvious to require an explanation.

Thus far did this new account of things render the appearances of the heavens more
completely coherent than had been done by any of the former systems. It did this, too,
by a more simple and intelligible, as well as more beautiful machinery. It represented the Sun, the great enlightener of the universe, whose body was alone larger than all the
Planets taken together, as established immoveable in the center, shedding light and
heat on all the worlds that circulated around him in one uniform direction, but in longer
or shorter periods, according to their different distances. It took away the diurnal
revolution of the firmament, whose rapidity, upon the old hypothesis, was beyond what
even thought could conceive. It not only delivered the imagination from the
embarrassment of Epicycles, but from the difficulty of conceiving these two opposite
motions going on at the same time, which the system of Ptolemy and Aristotle bestowed
upon all the Planets; I mean, their diurnal westward, and periodical eastward
revolutions. The Earth’s revolution round its own axis took away the necessity for
supposing the first, and the second was easily conceived when by itself. The Five
Planets, which seem, upon all other systems, to be objects of a species by themselves,
unlike to every thing to which the imagination has been accustomed, when supposed to
revolve along with the Earth round the Sun, were naturally apprehended to be objects
of the same kind with the Earth, habitable, opaque, and enlightened only by the rays of
the Sun. And thus this hypothesis, by classing them in the same species of things, with
an object that is of all others the most familiar to us, took off that wonder and
uncertainty which the strangeness and singularity of their appearance had excited; and
thus far, too, better answered the great end of Philosophy.
