## The Pleasure from Mutual Sympathy is not based on Self-Love, but from the similarity of the resonance of feelings

{{< s v="14" >}} Regardless of the cause of sympathy, we are most pleased when other people have a fellow-feeling with our own emotions. 
- We are shocked by the opposite. 

Some people say that all our feelings arise from self-love. 

They think:
- that our pleasure and pain from fellow-feeling comes from self love
- that man always needs the assistance of others, and this is why:
  - he rejoices whenever others adopt his own passions, as it ensures him of that assistance
  - he grieves whenever others reject his passions, as it prevents his aid

Pain and pleasure are always felt instantly. 

**But neither of them are derived from self-interest.**

A man is:
- happy when the people laugh at his jokes
- mortified when no one laughs 

<!-- #### Marginal Utility  -->

{{< s v="15" >}} His pleasure does not all arise from a sympathy with their amusement. 

His pain does not all arise from his disappointment when they do not laugh. 
<!-- - Though both the added vivacity and the disappointment contribute to his pleasure and pain. -->


After we have read a book so often, we can no longer enjoy reading it by ourselves. However, we can still enjoy reading it to a companion.
- To him, it has novelty.
  - We enter into his admiration for it, which we no longer have.
<!-- We consider all the book's ideas as how they appear to him, than in what appeared to ourselves. -->
  - By sympathy, his amusement enlivens our own.

On the contrary, we are vexed if the book does not entertain him.
<!--             We do not enjoy reading it to him.
    It is the same case here. -->

But his amusement or nonamusement at the book is not the sole cause of our pleasure or pain.
- It is **the sympathy or correspondence of the sentiments** that causes the pleasure. 
- It is the non-sympathy or noncorrespondence that causes pain. 

Sympathy thus enlivens joy and alleviates grief.

<!--         The mirth of our friends enlivens our own mirth.
        Their silence disappoints us.
        This may contribute to= 
            our pleasure from their mirth and
            our pain from their lack of mirth.
        But it is not the sole cause of either. -->


<!--             The lack of it causes pain, which cannot be accounted for in this way.
    My friends' sympathy with my joy might give me pleasure by enlivening that joy.
        But their sympathy with my grief gives me no pleasure, if it only served to enliven that grief. -->

<!--         It enlivens joy by presenting another source of satisfaction.
        It alleviates grief by giving the heart the only agreeable sensation which it can receive. -->

<sup>16</sup> We are more anxious to tell our friends our disagreeable passions than our agreeable ones.
- We get more satisfaction from their sympathy with our disagreeable passions than our agreeable ones.
- We are more shocked by the lack of sympathy.


{{< s v="17" >}} We are relieved when we find someone we can tell our sorrow to.
- We disburden some of our distress on his sympathy.
- He shares our distress and feels our sorrow.
  - The sorrow he feels alleviates the weight that we feel.
<!--   - Yet by relating their misfortunes they somewhat renew their grief.
        We awaken the remembrance of the causes of our affliction.
            Our tears flow faster than before.
            We are apt to abandon ourselves to sorrow.
    However, we take pleasure in all of this.
        We are sensibly relieved by it.
            Because the sweetness of his sympathy more than compensates that sorrow's bitterness.
                This sorrow had to be enlivened and renewed to excite this sympathy. -->

On the contrary, the cruelest insult makes fun of our calamities.
- It is impolite if a man is not affected with the joy of his companions.
- But it is a gross inhumanity for him not to be serious when they tell him of their afflictions.


{{< s v="18" >}}  Love is an agreeable passion. Resentment is a disagreeable passion.

It is alright for our friends not to like what we like. But we expect them to resent what we resent.

<!--  , as that they should enter into our resentments. We can forgive them though they are little affected with the favours we may have received. But we lose all patience if they are indifferent about the injuries done to us. -->
They can avoid being friends to our other friends. But they can hardly avoid being enemies to our enemies.

We quarrel with them if they become friends with our enemies.

<!--         We seldom resent if they are not friends with our friends.
 -->            
Love and joy can satisfy the heart alone, but grief and resentment require sympathy more strongly .


{{< s v="19" >}} People are pleased with our sympathy and hurt by lack of it. We are pleased when we are able to sympathize with him.

<!--         We are hurt when we are unable to do so.
        We congratulate the successful.
        We condole with the afflicted.
    Our pleasure in our conversation with someone we sympathize with, more than compensates our view of his sorrow.
 -->
On the contrary, it is always disagreeable to be unable to sympathize with another.
<!--         It hurts us to find that we cannot share his uneasiness. -->

- If a person's misfortunes does not affect us, we call him weak because we cannot enter into his feelings.
- On the other hand, we disapprove of someone who is too happy from any piece of good fortune. We call it levity and folly because we cannot go along with it.
  - We even disapprove if our friend laughs loudly at a joke that we think is not so funny because we feel that we ourselves could not laugh at it as much.
