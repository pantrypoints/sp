{{< s v="16" >}} We wamt to be loved because of our natural love for some people. 

We dread to be hated because of our natural hatred for some people. 

<!-- We are not so much afraid of being hated, as that of being hateful and despicable.
We dread doing anything which can make us hated, even if we know that that hatred would never be exerted against us. -->

A person does something really bad in secret. 
- When he looks back on it, he feels ashamed if he views it how the impartial spectator would view it
- He still feels that he would hated.

<!--  be the natural object of hatred.
- He trembles at what he would suffer if he were punished.
- He would feel the agony of horror and remorse. -->

<!-- It is useless for a person to hide his wrong conduct from others even if he could hide them perfectly.
, he finds that he can enter into none of the motives which influenced it.
He is abashed and confounded at the thoughts of it.
He feels that shame which he would feel if his actions were known.
His imagination anticipates the contempt and derision.

Only the ignorance of those he lives with saves him from these. -->

<!-- If he had been guilty of those enormous crimes which excite detestation and resentment, he could never think of them without 

He would still feel both these sentiments to embitter the whole of his life, even if: 
he could be assured that no man was ever to know it, and
he could even bring himself to believe that there was no God to revenge it.
He would still regard himself as the natural object of everyone's hatred and indignation.
If his heart has not grown callous by the habit of crimes, he could not think without terror and astonishment even of: 
how mankind would look on him

what would be the expression of their eyes and faces if the dreadful truth were known. are the demons, the avenging furies which-->

These natural pangs of an fearful conscience haunt the guilty.

<!-- - allow them neither quiet nor repose,
- often drive them to despair and distraction from which: 
- no assurance of secrecy can protect them,
- no principles of irreligion can entirely deliver them, and
- nothing can free them but the vilest and most abject of all states:  a complete insensibility to honour and infamy, vice and virtue. -->

Skilled criminals commit crime so coolly as to avoid the suspicion. Sometimes, they discover their guilt by themselves and admit their crime. 

<!-- 
 most detestable men have taken their measures 

 of guilt in executing the most dreadful crimes.  through their situation's horror. No human sagacity could ever have investigated their guilt. By: 
- acknowledging their guilt,
- submitting themselves to the resentment of their offended fellow-citizens,
- satiating that vengeance which they knew were meant for them,
- their death, they hoped: 
to reconcile themselves to mankind's natural sentiments,
to be less worthy of hatred and resentment,
to atone for their crimes, and
to die in peace, with the forgiveness of all, by becoming the objects of compassion instead of horror.
Compared to what they felt before the discovery of their guilt, even the thought of this was happiness. -->


{{< s v="17" >}} In such cases, the horror of blame-worthiness conquers the dread of blame.

<!-- , even in persons who have no extraordinary sensibility of character. -->

To pacify the remorse of their own consciences, they voluntarily submitted themselves to the punishment which they might easily have avoided.
 

{{< s v="18" >}}  Only the most superficial people can be happy with unmerited praise.
- But unmerited reproach can mortify anyone.

Foolish tales frequently circulate in society.
- Those tales always die away after a few weeks from their own falsehood.
- People learn to despise them. 

<!-- with ordinary constancy  -->

But an innocent man is often shocked by the false imputation of a crime, especially when that imputation is supported by some circumstances.

He is perfectly conscious of his own innocence.
But the very imputation give him disgrace.

<!-- His just indignation at so gross an injury might frequently be improper and sometimes even impossible to revenge.
But it itself is a very painful sensation.
The greatest tormentor of the human breast is a violent resentment which cannot be gratified. -->

An innocent man, brought to the scaffold by the false imputation of an infamous or odious crime, suffers the most cruel misfortune.

His agony might frequently be greater than the agony of criminals who are really guilty.

Profligate criminals, such as common thieves and highwaymen, frequently have little sense of their own conduct's baseness.
Consequently, they have no remorse.

They do not trouble themselves on the punishment's justice or injustice. They always expected the gibbet to fall to them.

When it does fall, they: 
- consider themselves only as less lucky than their companions,
- submit to their fortune with only the uneasiness from the fear of death.

Such worthless wretches, frequently see such fear and can easily conquer them completely.



On the contrary, the innocent man is tormented by the injustice done to him, over and above his uneasiness from this fear of death.

He is horrified at the thoughts of the infamy which the punishment may shed on his memory.

He foresees, with the most exquisite anguish, that he will be remembered by his dearest friends and relations with shame and horror for his supposed disgraceful conduct, instead of with regret and affection.

The shades of death bring him a darker and more melancholy gloom than natural.

We hope that such fatal accidents happen very rarely in any country, for mankind's tranquility.

But they happen sometimes in all countries, even in those where justice is well administered.

Galas was an unfortunate man of much more than ordinary constancy.
- He broke upon the wheel and burnt at Tholouse for the supposed murder of his own son, of which he was perfectly innocent.
- He seemed to deprecate, not so much the cruelty of the punishment, as the disgrace which the imputation might bring on his memory.
- After he had been broken and before going into the fire, a monk who attended the execution, exhorted him to confess his crime.
- Galas said, "My Father, can you bring yourself to believe that I am guilty?"


{{< s v="19" >}} To persons in such unfortunate circumstances, that humble philosophy which confines its views to this life, perhaps can afford little consolation.

Everything that could render life or death respectable is taken from them.
They are condemned to death and everlasting infamy.
Only religion can afford them any effectual comfort.

She alone can tell them, that it is of little importance what man may think of their conduct, while the all-seeing Judge of the world approves of it.

She alone can present to them the view of another world.

It is a world of more candour, humanity, and justice, than the present.

It is where: 
- their innocence in due time will be declared, and
- their virtue to be finally rewarded.

The same great principle which can alone strike terror into triumphant vice, affords the only effectual consolation to disgraced and insulted innocence.
