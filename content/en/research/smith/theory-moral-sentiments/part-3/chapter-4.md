{{< s v="88" >}} The impartial spectator does not always need to be far to pervert our judgments on our own conduct.

When he is near, the violence and injustice of our own selfish feelings are sometimes enough to induce the man within the breast to make a report very different from what our real circumstances can authorise.


{{< s v="89" >}} There are 2 occasions when we examine our own conduct:

 <!-- and try to view it as how the impartial spectator sees it:  -->

1. When we are about to act

2. After we have acted

Our views tend to be very partial in both cases. But they tend to be most partial when they must be impartial.



### Self-Reflection Before an Act

{{< s v="90" >}} Before we perform an act, our feeling's eagerness will seldom allow us to think about what we are doing.

<!-- Our violent emotions discolour our views even when we are trying to: 
- place ourselves in another person's situation, and
- regard the objects that interest us as how they will naturally appear to another person. -->

We might want to see things as how other people see them.

But the fury of our own feelings goes against this.

It constantly calls us back to our own place to get a distorted view of things, arising from self-love.

<!-- , where everything appears magnified and misrepresented by . instantaneous -->

We only get short glimpses of how those objects would appear to others.

These glimpses: 
- vanish in a moment, and
- are not altogether just

<!-- , even while they last. -->

We cannot even for that moment: 
- divest ourselves entirely of the heat* from our situation, and
- consider what we are about to do with complete impartiality.

{{< n n="In Cartesian Physics, this heat is from the animal spirits. This can be avoided metaphysically-mechanistically by avoiding heating foods such as meat and intoxicants. This is why the Asian religions promote a vegetarian diet and are against intoxicants" >}}


<!-- As father Malebranche says, the passions all: 
- justify themselves, and
- seem reasonable and proportional to their objects, as long as we continue to feel them.

We protect our ego through self-deceit, a weakness of humans which creates half of the disorders of human life -->

### Self-Reflection After an Act

{{< s v="91" >}} We can enter more coolly into the indifferent spectator's feeling when: 
- the action is over and
- the feelings which prompted it have subsided.

What interested us before is almost now as indifferent to us as it always was to the impartial spectator.

We can now examine our own conduct with his candour and impartiality.

<!-- The man of today is no longer agitated by the feelings which distracted him yesterday.

When the burst of emotion is fairly over, we can identify ourselves with the ideal man within the breast.

We can view our own situation through our own eyes.

We can view our own conduct with the severe eyes of the impartial spectator. -->

But our judgments now: 
- are often of little importance compared to what they were before, and
- can frequently produce only vain regret and unavailing repentance.

It does not always secure us from similar errors in the future.

<!-- However, they are seldomly quite candid even in this case. -->

Our opinion on our own character depends entirely on our judgments on our past conduct.

It is so disagreeable to think bad of ourselves.

We often purposely turn away our view from those circumstances which might render that judgment unfavourable.

They say that a bold surgeon has hands which do not tremble when he performs an operation on himself.

A man is often equally bold if he pulls off the veil of self-delusion which covers the deformities of his own conduct from his own view.

Rather than see our own behaviour so disagreeably, we often foolishly try to exasperate those unjust feelings which misled us.

By artifice, we try to: 
- awaken our old hatreds, and
- irritate afresh our almost forgotten resentments.

We even exert ourselves for this miserable purpose.

We thus persevere in injustice, merely because: 
- we were once unjust, and
- we are ashamed to see that we were so.
