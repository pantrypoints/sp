{{< s v="92" >}} Mankind's views on the propriety of their own conduct are so partial, both:
- during the action and 
- after the action.

It is so difficult for people to view it as how any indifferent spectator would consider it.

Man's moral sense is a power of perception which distinguishes the beauty or deformity of passions and affections.

If a man judged his own conduct more immediately by this moral sense, then this moral sense would more accurately judge his conduct than the conduct of other men.

<!-- The moral sense of other men have a more distant prospect. -->
 

{{< s v="93" >}} The fatal weakness of people is their own self-deceit.
- Half the disorders of human life is caused by this.

If we saw ourselves as how others see us then we would unavoidably reform ourselves. 
- We could not otherwise endure the sight.
 <!-- would generally be . -->

<!-- , or in which they would see us if they knew all -->


Nature's remedy for self-deceit are general rules.


{{< s v="94" >}} However, Nature has not left this important weakness without a remedy.
- She has not abandoned us entirely to the delusions of self-love.

Our observations on the conduct of others let us form in ourselves general rules on what to do or not to do.

 <!-- is fit and proper to be done or avoided. -->

Some of their actions shock all our natural sentiments. 

This shock is confirmed when we hear everybody detest against those actions.

<!-- This further confirms and even exasperates our natural sense of their deformity. -->

<!-- It satisfies us that we view them in the proper light, when we see other people view them in the same light. -->

We resolve never to be guilty of those shocking actions.

  <!-- like, nor ever to render ourselves the objects of universal disapprobation in this way. -->

We thus naturally lay down that general rule to ourselves.

 <!-- that we should avoid all actions which render us the objects of all those dreaded feelings. -->

<!-- These make us odious, contemptible, or punishable. call forth our approbation -->


On the contrary, we approve of good actions.
- We hear everybody express the same favourable opinion on them.

<!-- Everybody is eager to honour them.
They excite all of mankind's love, gratitude, and admiration.
By nature, we have the strongest desire for those feelings. -->

This makes us naturally:
- ambitious to perform the same good actions.
- lay down another rule to ourselves, that we should seek every opportunity of acting in that good way.


{{< s v="95" >}} Thus, the general rules of morality are formed.

They are ultimately founded on our the experience of moral faculties.

We do not originally approve or condemn particular actions.

Because upon examination, they appear to be agreeable or inconsistent with a certain general rule.

On the contrary, the general rule is formed when we find that certain kinds of actions are approved or disapproved of.

A person is murdered by the avarice and envy of someone he loved and trusts.
- The dying man complains more of his false friend ingratitude, than of the murder.
<!-- One of the most sacred rules of conduct prohibited the taking away of an innocent life. -->
- A witness to this murder will immediately feel it as a very blamable action without thinking of what rule it violated.

<!-- could have no occasion to reflect that this was a plain violation of that rule, and consequently a .
His detestation of this crime would arise instantaneously and before he has formed to himself any such general rule. -->
  - He might afterwards form the general rule against murder from his detestation
 <!-- he felt in his own breast at the thought of this and other actions of the same kind. -->


{{< s v="96" >}} When we read history or romance, we:
- admire the generous actions
- condemn the base ones

Neither of them arise from reflecting that there are certain general rules which declare: 
- all generous actions admirable, and
- all base actions contemptible.

On the contrary, those general rules are all formed from our experience on the effects naturally produced on us by different kinds of actions.


{{< s v="97" >}} The following actions excite the following in us:

Action of Doer | Feeling in Observer
--- | ---
Amiable | Love
Respectable | Respect
Horrid | Horror

 <!-- are actions which naturally excite the observer's love, , or  for its doer. -->

General rules determine which actions match those sentiments.*

{{< n n="We can think of this as Cartesian Relativity for morality and feelings for a personal soul-level" >}}

 <!-- are or are not the objects of each of those -->

These rules can only be formed by observing what certain actions excite certain feelings.


{{< s v="98" >}} These general rules are formed and universally established by the concurring feelings of mankind.*

{{< n n="We can think of this as Cartesian Relativity for morality and feelings for an oversoul-level" >}}

<!-- We frequently appeal to them as to the standards of judgment, in  -->

When we debate on the morality of complicated actions, we turn to these general rules.

<!-- They are commonly cited as the ultimate foundations of what is just and unjust. -->

This has misled eminent authors to think that mankind's moral judgments were formed like the decisions of a court of justice that is based on the general rule.

<!-- Then, whether the action under consideration fell properly within its comprehension. -->

{{< s v="99" >}} When those general rules of conduct have been fixed in our mind by habitual reflection, they are very useful in correcting our moral judgements. 
 <!-- the misrepresentations of self-love on what is moral. -->

An egotistic resentful man might regard his enemy's death as a small compensation for the wrong he has received.
<!-- , even if it were just a very slight provocation. -->

But his observations on the conduct of others have taught him that such a revenge is horrible.
- This might make him abstain from revenge, as a rule.
- This rule renders him incapable of such a violence.
 <!-- all such sanguinary revenges appear. -->

<!-- Unless his education has been very singular, he lays as an inviolable rule, to always . -->

<!-- The original fury of his own temper might have made him determine the revenge to be: 
quite just and proper, and
what every impartial spectator would approve of. -->

<!-- But his reverence for the rule which past experience has impressed on him: -->

His own general rule: 
- checks the impetuosity of his feelings, and
- corrects the partial views of his ego
 <!-- suggested by his self-love. -->

<!-- If he lets himself be controlled by resentment as to violate this rule, he will not be able to throw away his respect for this rule.

At the peak of his passion, this respect makes him hesitate and tremble at the thought of what he is about to do.

He is secretly conscious to himself that he is breaking those rules: 
- which he had resolved never to infringe during his cool hours,
- which he had never seen infringed by others without the highest disapprobation, and
- of which the infringement must soon render him similarly disagreeable.  can take the last fatal decision,-->

His resentment against his enemy might become strong as to let him violate this general rule. 

Before he actually acts out his revenge, he is tormented with doubt.

He is terrified of violating his own general rule.

<!-- so sacred a rule. -->

<!-- At the same time, he is urged on by the fury of his desires to violate it.

He changes his purpose every moment. -->

Sometimes he resolves to adhere again to his general rule.

<!--  principle, and
- not to indulge a passion which may bring him shame and repentance. -->

<!-- He is calmed momentarily from the prospect of that peace which he will enjoy if stops himself. -->

But immediately, the passion for revenge rouses anew.

<!-- With fresh fury, it drives him on to commit what he had resolved to abstain from. -->

Wearied and distracted with those continual irresolutions, from a sort of despair, he think of committing suicide. 

<!-- makes the final fatal and irrecoverable step.

He throws himself over a precipice, with that terror and amazement as one who is fleeing from an enemy. -->

<!-- He meets a more certain destruction than from anything that pursues him from behind.

Such are his feelings even at the time of acting.

Though he is then less sensible of the impropriety of his own conduct than afterwards, when his feelings are gratified and palled.

He begins to view what he has done as how others would see it. -->

Then he actually feels, what he had only foreseen very imperfectly before, the stings of remorse and repentance.

 <!-- begin to agitate and torment him. -->
