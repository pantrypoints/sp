{{< s v="100" >}} The general rules of conduct create the sense of duty.

It is a principle of the greatest consequence in human life.
- It is the only principle by which most of mankind can direct their actions.

Many men behave very decently because of the established general rules of behaviour.

<!-- They perhaps never felt the sentiment on propriety.
They might have acted merely from a regard to the established rules. -->

Assume that a man has received great benefits from another person, but feels only a small gratitude for that person.

Virtuous education will teach him: 
- how odious ungrateful actions are, and
- how amiable grateful actions are

<!-- Though his heart is not warmed with any grateful affection, he -->

And so he will strive to act more grateful.

<!-- - He will try to pay all those regards and attentions to his patron with the liveliest gratitude.
- He will visit him regularly.
- He will behave to him respectfully.

He will only talk of him:
- with the highest esteem, and
- of the many obligations which he owes to him. -->

He will carefully embrace every opportunity of making a proper return for past services.

He may do all this too without any hypocrisy or blamable dissimulation.

<!-- ,
- selfish intention of obtaining new favours, and
- design of imposing on his benefactor or the public. -->

His motives may be no other than: 
- a reverence for the established rule of duty, and
- a serious and earnest desire of acting according to the law of gratitude.

In the same way, a wife may sometimes not feel that tender regard for her husband.

 <!-- suitable to their marriage. -->

However, if she has been virtuously educated, she will try to: 
- act as if she felt it,
<!-- - be careful, officious, faithful, and sincere, and -->
- be attentive to her husband.

The sentiment of conjugal affection would have prompted her to do this. 

Such wife is not the best even if she seriously wanted to fulfill her duty as they will fail in many delicate regards.

<!-- They will miss many opportunities of obliging.
They could never have overlooked such opportunities if they had the proper sentiment.
They are perhaps the second best of their kind. -->

If the regard to the general rules of conduct has been very strongly impressed on them, neither of them will fail in the essential part of their duty.

Only the happiest people can: 
- precisely match behaviour to the smallest difference of situation, and
- always act with the most delicate and accurate propriety.

The coarse clay of which the bulk of mankind are formed, cannot be wrought up to such perfection.

However, anyone with discipline, education, and example, might be so impressed with a regard to general rules, as to: 
- act on almost always with tolerable decency, and
- avoid any considerable degree of blame through his whole life.


{{< s v="101" >}} Without this sacred regard to general rules, no one's conduct can be much depended on.

This constitutes the most essential difference between a man of principle and honour and a worthless fellow.

The man of principle always adheres steadily and resolutely to his maxims

<!-- He preserves through his whole life one even tenour of conduct. -->

The worthless man acts variously and accidentally, as humour, inclination, or interest chance to be uppermost.


Everyone is subject to such inequalities of humour.

Without this principle, the man who, in his cool hours, had the most delicate sensibility to the propriety of conduct, might often be led to act absurdly on the most frivolous occasions.

It might be impossible to assign any serious motive for his behaving this way.


Your friend visits you when you do not want to receive him.
- But the general rules of civility and hospitality prohibits rudeness.


<!-- In your present mood, his civility is very apt to appear an impertinent intrusion. -->

<!-- If you were to give way to your current views of things, you would behave to him with coldness and contempt, though your temper was civil. -->

That habitual reverence which your former experience has taught you for these, enables you to act on all such occasions, with nearly equal propriety


It hinders those inequalities of temper, to which all men are subject, from influencing your conduct in any very sensible degree.

The duties of politeness are so easily observed.

<!-- One can scarce have any serious motive to violate it. -->

The duties of justice, truth, chastity, and fidelity are often so difficult to observe.
- There may be so many strong motives to violate them.

What would become of these duties if the general rules and the duties of politeness would be so frequently violated?

The very existence of human society depends on the observance of these duties.

<!-- It would crumble into nothing if mankind were not impressed with a reverence for those important rules of conduct. -->
