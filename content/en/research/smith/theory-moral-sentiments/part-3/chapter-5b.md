{{< s v="102" >}} This reverence for the rules of conduct is first impressed by nature.

<!-- It is afterwards confirmed by reasoning and  is still further enhanced by an opinion which -->

Philosophy later confirms that those important rules of morality are the laws of the Deity.

The Deity will reward the obedient and punish the transgressors of their duty in the end.
 

{{< s v="103" >}} This opinion [law of karma] is first impressed by nature.

People naturally ascribe their sentiments to mysterious beings which are the objects of religious fear.

<!-- They cannot conceive any other to ascribe them to.  they have experienced  and darkness of pagan superstition,-->

Those unknown, imaginary, but unseen intelligences, necessarily resemble actual intelligences.

During the ignorance, mankind has formed their divinities crudely. 

 <!-- with so little delicacy. -->

Men indiscriminately ascribed to them all the passions of human nature, such as lust, hunger, avarice, envy, revenge.

They had the highest admiration for the excellence of those beings.

Men ascribed to them those sentiments and qualities which are the great ornaments of humanity.

Raised to divine perfection were: 
- the love of virtue and beneficence
- the abhorrence of vice and injustice

The man who was injured called on Jupiter to witness the wrong done to him. 

<!-- He could not doubt that Jupiter: 
- would behold it with the same indignation which animated the meanest of mankind
- looked on when injustice was committed -->

The man who did the injury felt himself to be the object of mankind's resentment.

<!-- His natural fears led him to impute the same sentiments to those awful beings.
He could not avoid their presence.
He could not resist their power. -->

These natural hopes, fears, and suspicions, were propagated by sympathy and confirmed by education.

The gods were believed to be: 
- the rewarders of mercy, and
- the avengers of injustice.

<!-- Thus religion, even in its rudest form, gave a sanction to the rules of morality long before the age of philosophy. -->

The natural sense of duty was enforced by the terrors of religion because it philosophy was too slow in revealing it. 

<!-- too important to mankind's happiness for nature to leave it to the slowness and uncertainty of  researches. anticipations-->

{{< s v="104" >}} Philosophy confirmed those original purposes of nature.

Our moral faculties are from: 
- a modification of reason,
- an original instinct called a moral sense, or
- some other principle of our nature.

Our moral faculties were given to us to:
- direct our life
- be the supreme arbiters of all our actions
- superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and
- judge how far each of them was to be indulged or restrained.


Some have pretended wrongly that our moral faculties: 
- are on a level with the other faculties of our nature
- have no more right to restrain our other faculties
 
<!-- , than our other faculties restrain our moral faculties  or principle of action-->

In reality, no other faculty judges other faculties.
- Love does not judge resentment.
- Resentment does not judge love.

<!-- - Love and resentment are opposite. -->

They cannot approve or disapprove of one another.

<!-- But it is the peculiar office of those faculties now under our consideration to judge, to  -->


The job of our moral faculties is to bestow censure or applause on all the other principles of our nature.
- They may even be considered as senses to sense our nature. 

<!-- detect those principles.
 are the objects. -->

Every sense is supreme over its own objects.

<!-- There is no appeal from: 
- the eye with regard to the beauty of colours,
- the ear with regard to the harmony of sounds, and
- the taste with regard to the agreeableness of flavours.

Each of those senses judges in the last resort of its own objects. -->
- Whatever gratifies the taste is sweet.
- Whatever pleases the eye is beautiful.
- Whatever soothes the ear is harmonious.

The very essence of each of those qualities consists in its being fitted to please the sense to which it is addressed.

In the same way, our moral faculties to determine: 
- when the ear should be soothed,
- when the eye should be indulged,
- when the taste should be gratified, and
- when and how far these should be indulged or restrained.

<!-- every other principle of our nature -->

What is agreeable to our moral faculties, is fit, right, and proper.
- The contrary is wrong, unfit, and improper.

<!-- The sentiments which they approve of are graceful and becoming.
The contrary are ungraceful and unbecoming.

The very words, right, wrong, fit, improper, graceful, unbecoming, mean only what pleases or displeases those faculties. -->
