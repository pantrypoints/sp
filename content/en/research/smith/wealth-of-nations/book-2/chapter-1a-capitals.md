## Fixed Capital, Circulating Capital, and Stock for Consumption

{{< s v="1" >}} When a man's stock can only maintain him for a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it.
- He consumes it as sparingly as he can.
- He tries to acquire new supplies before it is consumed.
  - In this case, his revenue is derived from his labour only.
  - This is the state of most of the labouring poor in all countries.


{{< s v="2" >}} But when he has enough stock to maintain him for months or years, he tries to derive a revenue from it. He reserves some for his consumption until this revenue comes in.

His whole stock is made up of 2 parts:

1. His capital
  - He expects this part to provide revenue
2. His stock for immediate consumption
  - This consists of:
    - the stock that he means to consume,
    - the stock that becomes his revenue, or
    - the stock obtained in previous years which has not yet been consumed, such as clothes, furniture, etc.

The stock for immediate consumption can be one or a mix of these three.


{{< s v="3" >}} Capital may yield a revenue or profit to its employer in 2 ways:

> 1. {{< s v="4" >}} As Circulating Capital

This is employed in raising, manufacturing, or buying goods and selling them again with a profit. A Circulating Capital yields no revenue to its employer while it remains in his possession.

A merchant's goods provide no revenue until he sells them for money.
- The money yields him little until it is exchanged for goods.
- His capital is continually going from him in one shape and returning to him in another.
- Only such successive exchanges can yield him any profit.

> 2. {{< s v="5" >}} As Fixed Capital

This yields a revenue without changing masters or circulating any further. Examples are= 
- land improvements 
- useful machines


{{< s v="6" >}} Different occupations require very different proportions of fixed and circulating capitals.


{{< s v="7" >}} A merchant's capital is a circulating capital. He uses no machines or instruments of trade other than his shop or warehouse.


{{< s v="8" >}} A manufacturer’s capital must be fixed in the tools of his trade.

This part may be very small in some while very great in others.
- A tailor only requires needles as his tools.
- A shoemaker needs more expensive tools.
- A weaver needs more expensive tools than a shoemaker.

However, most of the capital of all such craftsmen are circulated in: 
- the wages of their workers, or
- the price of their materials

They are repaid with a profit by the price of the work.


{{< s v="9" >}} In other works, more fixed capital is required. For example=  
- in a big ironworks, the furnace, forge, and slit-mill are very expensive instruments
- in coal-works and mines, the machinery for drawing out the water is even more expensive


{{< s v="10" >}} A farmer's agricultural tools are a fixed capital. He earns from his tools by keeping them.

The wages and maintenance of his labouring servants are a circulating capital.
- He parts with the wages that he gives to them and earns from their labour.

The price of his labouring cattle is a fixed capital. 
- The farmer earns by keeping them.

The maintenance of his cattle is a circulating capital.
- He profits by parting with their maintenance.

Cattle, which are sold and not used for labour, are a circulating capital.
- The farmer profits by parting with them.

A flock of sheep or a herd of cattle used for wool and milk is a fixed capital.
- Profits are made by keeping them.

Their food is a circulating capital.
- Profit is made by parting with it to feed them, to then produce wool and milk for sale.

The whole value of the seed is a fixed capital. 
- It goes backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary. 
- But it never changes masters and does not circulate.
- The farmer profits by its increase, not by its sale.


{{< s v="11" >}} The general stock of any society is the same with that of all its inhabitants. It naturally divides itself into the same three portions, each with a distinct function.
