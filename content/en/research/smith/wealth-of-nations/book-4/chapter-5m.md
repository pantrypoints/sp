The 2 following Accounts are joined to illustrate what is said in the Book 4, Chapter 5 on the Tonnage bounty to the White Herring Fishery.

An Account of Busses fitted out in Scotland for 11 Years, with the Number of Empty Barrels carried out, and the Number of Barrels of Herrings caught; also the Bounty at a Medium on each Barrel of Seasteeks, and on each Barrel when fully packed.

Seasticks  	378347 	Bounty at a medium for each barrel of seasticks 	£. 	0 	8 	2¼

But a barrel of seasticks being only reckoned 2/3 of a barrel fully packed, 1/3 is deducted 1/3 deducted 	126115 2/3 	which brings the bounty to 	£. 	0 	12 	3¾ Barrels full packed, 	252231 1/3
And if the herrings are exported, there is besides a premium of 		0 	2 	8
			
So that the bounty paid by Government in money for each barrel, is. 	£ 	0 	14 	11 ¾
But if to this, the duty of the salt usually taken credit for as expended in curing each barrel, which at a medium is of foreign, one bushel and 1/4 of a bushel, at 10 s. a bushel, be added, namely=  		0 	12 	6
			
The bounty on each barrel would amount to 	£ 	1 	7 	5 ¾
			
If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand thus, namely:
Bounty as before 	£. 	0 	14 	11 ¾
—but if to this bounty the duty on two bushels of Scots salt at 1 s. 6 d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel is added, to wit, 		0 	3 	0
			
The bounty on each barrel will amount to 	£. 	0 	17 	11 ¾

When buss herrings are entered for home consumption in Scotland, and pay the shilling a barrel of duty, the bounty stands thus, to wit, as before 	£ 	0 	12 	3 ¾
From which the 1 s. a barrel is to be deducted 		0 	1 	0
				0 	11 	3 ¾
But to that there is to be added again, the duty of the foreign salt used in curing a barrel of herrings, viz.. 		0 	12 	6
			
So that the premium allowed for each barrel of herrings entered for home consumption is 	£. 	1 	3 	9 ¾
			
If the herrings are cured with British salt, it will stand as follows, viz.

Bounty on each barrel brought in by the busses as above 	£. 	0 	12 	3 ¾

From which deduct the 1 s. a barrel paid at the time they are entered for home consumption 		0 	1 	0
			
	£. 	0 	11 	3 ¾
But if to the bounty the duty on two bushels of Scots salt at 1 s. 6 d. per bushel, supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel, is added, to wit 		0 	3 	0
			
The premium for each barrel entered for home consumption will be 	£. 	0 	14 	3 ¾

Though the loss of duties upon herrings exported cannot, perhaps, properly be considered as bounty; that upon herrings entered for home consumption certainly may.
