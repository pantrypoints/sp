{{< s v="28" >}} The violence of these regulations did not affect the quantity or quality of the annual wool produce as expected.

(I think it probably affected the quantity more than the quality)
The interest of the wool growers must have been hurt.
But on the whole, their interest was hurt much less than imagined.


{{< s v="29" >}} These considerations will not justify the absolute prohibition of wool exportation.

But they will fully justify a tax on wool exportation.


{{< s v="30" >}} To hurt the interest of any order of citizens to promote the interest of some other, is contrary to the justice and equality of treatment the sovereign owes to his subjects.

The prohibition certainly hurts the wool grower's interest to promote the interest of the manufacturers.


{{< s v="31" >}} "Every different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support of the sovereign or commonwealth."

A tax of 5 or 10 shillings on the exportation of every ton of wool would produce a very considerable revenue to the sovereign.

It would hurt the interest of the growers less than the prohibition on wool exports.
- Because it probably would not lower the price of wool so much.

It would afford a sufficient advantage to the manufacturer.

Even though he might not be able buy his wool so cheap as under the prohibition.
- He would still be able to buy his wool 5 or 10 shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it.
- He would save the freight and insurance foreign manufacturers would need to pay.

It is impossible to devise a tax which could produce a considerable revenue to the sovereign while bringing so little inconveniency to anybody.


{{< s v="32" >}} The ban does not prevent wool exportation.

"It is exported in great quantities."

The great difference between the price at home and the price in the foreign market is such a temptation to smuggling.

All the rigour of the law cannot prevent it.

This illegal exportation is advantageous only to the smuggler.

A legal, taxed exportation will afford a revenue to the sovereign.
- It will save the imposition of other taxes which might be more burdensome and inconvenient.
- It might be advantageous to all the subjects of the state.


{{< s v="33" >}} Fuller's earth or fuller's clay is supposed to be necessary for preparing and cleansing woollen manufactures.

Its exportation was subjected to nearly the same penalties as wool exportation.

Tobacco-pipe clay is different from fuller's clay but resembles it.
- Because of their resemblance, fuller's clay is sometimes exported as tobacco-pipe clay.
  - Tobacco-pipe clay has been given the same prohibitions and penalties.


{{< s v="34" >}} By the 1661 and 1662 chap. 7. the exportation of raw hides and tanned leather was prohibited except as boots, shoes, or slippers.

This law gave a monopoly to our bootmakers and shoemakers against our graziers and our tanners.

By subsequent statutes, our tanners were exempted from this monopoly upon paying a small tax of one shilling on the hundred weight of tanned leather, weighing 112 pounds.

They obtained the drawback of 2/3 of the excise duties imposed on leather.

All leather manufactures may be exported duty free.
- The exporter can get the drawback of the whole excise duties.

Our graziers are still subject to the old monopoly.
- Graziers are separated from one another and dispersed throughout the country.

They cannot easily combine to:
- impose monopolies on others
- exempt themselves from monopolies imposed on them by others

All manufacturers can easily do so when collected together in great cities.

Even the horns of cattle are prohibited to be exported.
- The insignificant trades of the horner and combmaker enjoy a monopoly against the graziers.


{{< s v="35" >}} Restraints by prohibitions or by taxes on exports which are not completely manufactured, are not peculiar to leather manufactures.

As long as any work remains to be done to fit any commodity for consumption, our manufacturers think that they themselves should do it.

"Woollen yarn and worsted are prohibited to be exported under the same penalties as wool."

Even white cloths are subject to an export duty.

Our dyers have a monopoly against our clothiers.

- Our clothiers probably would have been able to defend themselves against this monopoly.
- **But our principal clothiers are also dyers.**

Cases and dial plates for clocks and watches are banned for export.
- Our clock-makers and watch-makers want to keep the price of these materials low and away from foreign competition.


{{< s v="36" >}} By some old statutes of Edward 3rd, Henry 8th, and Edward 6th, the exportation of all metals was banned.

Lead and tin were alone excepted probably because of their abundance.
To encourage mining, the 1693 chap. 17. exempted iron, copper, and mundic metal made from British ore from the prohibition.

The exportation of British and foreign copper bars was afterwards allowed by the 1697 and 1698 chap. 26.
The exportation of unmanufactured brass, gun metal, bell metal, and shroff metal, is still banned.

Brass manufactures may be exported duty free.
