I cannot tell how you Athenians have been affected by my accusers.

They have told so many lies. 

<!-- But they were so persuasive that they almost made me forget who I was.
Yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. 

Of the many lies from them, I was quite amazed when they said that you should be on your guard and not allow yourselves to be deceived by the force of my eloquence. 

To say this, when they were certain to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved myself to be anything but a great speaker, did indeed appear to me most shameless—unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth; for if such is their meaning, I admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! 

Well, as I was saying, they have scarcely spoken the truth at all; but from me you shall hear the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No, by heaven! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am confident in the justice of my cause (Or, I am certain that I am right in taking this course.): at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character of a juvenile orator—let no one expect it of me. And I must beg of you to grant me a favour:—If I defend myself in my accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which I have been in the habit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere else, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this account. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the first time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country:—Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly. -->

I have had many accusers who have accused me falsely for so many years.

<!-- I am more afraid of my first accusers than of Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way. 
But far more dangerous are the others, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. 
The disseminators of this tale are the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that such enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them in the days when you were more impressible than you are now—in childhood, or it may have been in youth—and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer. And hardest of all,  -->

I do not know and cannot tell the names of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a Comic poet. 

<!-- All who from envy and malice have persuaded you—some of them having first convinced themselves—all this class of men are most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them up here, and cross-examine them, and therefore I must simply fight with shadows in my own defence, and argue when there is no one who answers. I will ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that  -->

My opponents are of two kinds:
- recent
- ancient

<!-- and I hope that you will see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations you heard long before the others, and much oftener.

Well, then, I must make my defence, and endeavour to clear away in a short time, a slander which has lasted a long time. May I succeed, if to succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause! The task is not an easy one; I quite understand the nature of it. And so leaving the event with God, in obedience to the law I will now make my defence.

I will begin at the beginning, and ask what is the accusation which has given rise to the slander of me, and in fact has encouraged  -->

Meletus has made this charge against me:

<!-- Well, what do the slanderers say? They shall be my prosecutors, and I will sum up their words in an affidavit:  -->

“Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others.” 

<!-- Such is the nature of the accusation: it is just what you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes (Aristoph., Clouds.), who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he walks in air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or little—not that I mean to speak disparagingly of any one who is a student of natural philosophy. I should be very sorry if Meletus could bring so grave a charge against me. But the simple truth is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to do with physical speculations. Very many of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this, and to them I appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon such matters...You hear their answer. And from what they say of this part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest. -->


As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take money. This accusation has no more truth in it than the other.

Although, if a man were really able to instruct mankind, to receive money for giving instruction would, in my opinion, be an honour to him. 

There is Gorgias of Leontium, and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities, and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them whom they not only pay, but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is at this time a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard.

I came to hear of him in this way:

I came across a man who has spent a world of money on the Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus.  I knew that he had sons, so I asked him:

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Callias, if your 2 sons were foals or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put over them. We should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve and perfect them. But as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them?
{{< /l >}}
 <!-- Is there any one who understands human and political virtue?  -->


{{< r a="Callias" >}}
Evenus the Parian. His charge is five minæ.
{{< /r >}}


Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this wisdom, and teaches at such a moderate charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proud and conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind.

Some among you will reply: “Yes, Socrates, but what is the origin of these accusations against you? You must have been doing something strange?"

<!-- All these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men: 
What is their cause? 
for we should be sorry to judge hastily of you.”  -->

Although some of you may think that I am joking, I am telling the entire truth. I am called wise and have such an evil fame because of my human wisdom. 

<!-- Whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may fail to describe, because I have it not myself. -->

I have a witness who is worthy of credit--the God of Delphi.

He will tell you about my wisdom and of what sort it is. 

Chaerephon was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours. He:
- shared in the recent exile of the people, and returned with you.
- was very impetuous in all his doings.
- went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was wiser than I was.

The Pythian prophetess answered, that there was no man wiser. 

Chaerephon is dead, but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of what I am saying.

When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean? 
- Yet he is a god, and cannot lie.

<!-- that would be against his nature.  -->

<!-- After long consideration, I thought of a method of trying the question.  -->

I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I can refute the god.

<!-- I should say to him, “Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.”  -->

So I went to a wise man, a politician.

<!-- He was  whom I selected for examination. -->
When I began to talk with him, I realized that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and still wiser by himself.

Then I tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise. And so he hated me.
<!-- The consequence was that he hated me. -->
- His enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. 

<!-- So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is,—for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows.

I neither know nor think that I know. 

In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.  -->

Then I went to another who had still higher pretensions to wisdom, and my conclusion was exactly the same. 
- Whereupon I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him.
