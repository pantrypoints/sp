O men of Athens, there are many reasons why I am not grieved at the vote of condemnation. 

I expected it. I am only surprised that the votes are so nearly equal.
- I had thought that the majority against me would have been far larger.

But now, had 30 votes gone over to the other side, I should have been acquitted.

I think that I have escaped Meletus.

Without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon, anyone may see that he would not have had a fifth part of the votes, as the law requires. In which case he would have incurred a fine of 1,000 drachmae.

He proposes death as the penalty.

What shall I propose on my part, O men of Athens? 

<!-- Clearly that which is my due. And what is my due?  -->

<!-- What return shall be made to the man  -->

I have never had the wit to be idle in my whole life.

But I have been careless of what the many care for:
- wealth
- family interests
- military offices
- speaking in the assembly
- magistracies
- plots and parties

I was really too honest to be a politician.

I did not go where I could do no good to you or to myself.

Instead, I went where I could do the greatest good privately to everyone/

I sought to persuade every man that he must:
- look into himself
- seek virtue and wisdom before he looks onto his private interests
- look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state

**This should be the order which he observes in all his actions.** 

<!-- What shall be done to such an one? 

Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens, if he has his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him.  -->

What reward is suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure that he may instruct you? 

The best reward, O men of Athens, is maintenance in the Prytaneum.

That is better than winning the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race.

<!-- , whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many.  -->

<!-- For I am in want, and he has enough.

He only gives you the appearance of happiness, and I give you the reality. And if I am to estimate the penalty fairly, I should say that maintenance in the Prytaneum is the just return. -->

<!-- Perhaps you think that I am braving you in what I am saying now, as in what I said before about the tears and prayers. But this is not so.  -->

I speak because I never intentionally wronged anyone.

Although I cannot convince you as the time has been too short.

If there were a law at Athens, as there is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided in one day, then I believe that I should have convinced you.

But I cannot in a moment refute great slanders.

<!--  and, as I am convinced that I never wronged another, I will assuredly not wrong myself. I will not say of myself that I deserve any evil, or propose any penalty. Why should I? because I am afraid of the penalty of death which Meletus proposes? 

When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil? Shall ?  -->


I say imprisonment is evil as it lets me be the slave of the magistrates of the year—of the Eleven.

A fine is just as bad if I am imprisoned until the fine is paid. There is the same objection.

<!-- Or shall the penalty be a fine, and -->

I would stay in prison for money I do not have and cannot pay.

You are not likely to exile me as I am blinded by the love of life.

You, my fellow citizens, cannot endure my discourses. Others would not likely endure me

<!-- You would not , and have found them so grievous and odious that you will have no more of them, others are likely to .  -->

I would wander from city to city always being driven out! 

Wherever I go, the young men will flock to me. 

- If I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request.
- If I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes.

Some one will say: 

{{< r a="People" >}}
Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue and then go into a foreign city where no one will interfere with you? 
{{< /r >}}


I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this.

Doing so would be a disobedience to the God. Therefore, I cannot hold my tongue. You will not believe that I am serious.

The greatest good of man is to discourse daily about:
- virtue, and
- those other things which you hear me examining myself and others

The unexamined life is not worth living.

 <!-- you are still less likely to believe me. Yet I say what is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you.  -->

Also, I have never been accustomed to think that I deserve to suffer any harm.

Had I money I might have estimated the offence that I was able to pay, and not have been much the worse. 

But I have no money. Therefore, I ask you to proportion the fine to my means.

Perhaps I could afford 1 mina, so I propose that penalty: Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, my friends here, bid me say 30 minæ, and they will be the sureties. 

Let 30 minæ be the penalty which they will be ample security to you.

Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man.

They call me wise, even though I am not wise, when they want to reproach you.

If you had waited a little while, I would have died of old age anyway. 

 <!-- your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature.  -->

As you can see, I am old and not far from death.

 <!-- I am speaking now not to all of you, but only to those who have condemned me to death. -->

You think that I was convicted because I had no words to acquit myself and that I would not say anything.

<!-- mean, if I had thought fit to leave nothing undone or unsaid.  -->

Not so. I was convicted because I did not 
- address you as you liked
- weep and wail like others 

<!-- But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to 
 would have liked me to do,  -->

<!-- and lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as I maintain, are unworthy of me.  -->

I thought at the time that I should not do anything common or mean when in danger.

Nor do I now repent of the style of my defence.

I would rather die having spoken in my way than speak in your way and live.

For neither in war nor at law should anyone use every way to escape death.

Often in battle, a man might escape death if he:
- throws away his arms
- falls on his knees before his pursuers

In other dangers, there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing to say and do anything. 

The difficulty is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness. For that runs faster than death.

I am old and move slowly. The slower runner has overtaken me. My accusers are keen and quick.

The faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. 

Now I depart being condemned by you to death.

They too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong. 

I abide by my award as they abide by theirs. 

I suppose that these things are fated and I think that they are well.

<!-- And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power. -->

I prophesy to you, my murderers, that immediately after my departure punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you.

You have killed me because you wanted to escape the accuser and not to give an account of your lives.

But the opposite will happen. 

 <!-- will not h be as you suppose: far otherwise.  -->

There will be more accusers of you than there are now, accusers whom hitherto I have restrained.

They are younger and will be more inconsiderate with you, and you will be more offended at them.

If you think that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken.

That is not a way of possible or honourable escape.

The easiest and noblest way is not to be disabling others, but to be improving yourselves.

<!-- This is the prophecy which I utter before my departure to the judges who have condemned me. -->

<!-- Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you about the thing which has come to pass, while the magistrates are busy, and before I go to the place at which I must die.

Stay then a little, for we may as well talk with one another while there is time. You are my friends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me. O my judges—for you I may truly call judges—I should like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance.  -->

The internal oracle has a divine faculty which has constantly been opposing me even about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error in any matter.

<!-- and now as you see there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed to be, the last and worst evil.  -->

But the oracle did not oppose me when I left my house this morning, or when I was on my way to the court, or while I was speaking.

<!-- , at anything which I was going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing I either said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the explanation of this silence? I will tell you. -->

I believe that:
- what has happened to me is a good
- those of us who think that death is an evil are wrong

For the customary sign would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil.

There is great reason to hope that death is a good. Either:
- death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness or
- there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another.

If there is no consciousness, but an undisturbed sleep, then death will be an unspeakable gain for eternity is then only a single night.
 <!-- like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams -->

<!-- For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain;  -->

But if death is the journey to another place then this is the greatest good. 

<!-- , and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?  -->

A pilgrim who arrives in the world below is delivered from the justice in this world, and finds the true judges there:
- Minos
- Rhadamanthus
- Aeacus
- Triptolemus
- other sons of God who were righteous in their own life

That pilgrimage will be worth making. 

What would not a man give to talk to Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod, and Homer? 

If this be true, let me die again and again. 

I myself shall have a wonderful interest in meeting and conversing with:
- Palamedes
- Ajax the son of Telamon
- any other ancient hero who has suffered death through an unjust judgment

I would be happy to compare my own sufferings with theirs.

Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge. 

As in this world, so also in the next.

I shall find out:
- who is wise
- who pretends to be wise
- who is not.

What would not a man give to examine:
- the leader of the great Trojan expedition
- Odysseus or Sisyphus
- numberless other men and women 

<!-- What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions!  -->

In that world they do not put a man to death for asking questions.

<!-- For besides being happier than we are, they will be immortal, if what is said is true. -->

Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty, that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death.

He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching end happened by mere chance. 

But I see clearly that the time had arrived when it was better for me to die and be released from trouble; wherefore the oracle gave no sign. 

For which reason, also, I am not angry with my condemners, or with my accusers; they have done me no harm, although they did not mean to do me any good; and for this I may gently blame them.

Still I have a favour to ask of them.

When my sons are grown up, please punish them, trouble them as I have troubled you if they:
- care about riches, or anything more than virtue or
- pretend to be something when they are really nothing

Then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing.

If you do this, both I and my sons will have received justice at your hands.

The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways—I to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows.
