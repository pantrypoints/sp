{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I am seeking a definition of all virtue
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
I would define virtue as the power of governing mankind.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Does this definition of virtue include all virtue? Is virtue the same in a child and in a slave, Meno? 

Can the child govern his father, or the slave his master; and would he who governed be any longer a slave?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
I think not, Socrates.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
To you, virtue is 'the power of governing.' But do you add 'justly'?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
Yes, I agree there; for justice is virtue.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Would you say that 'justice is virtue' or 'justice is **a** virtue'?

For example, is round 'a figure' and there are other figures, or is round the only figure?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
Yes. There are other virtues such as courage, temperance, wisdom, and magnanimity. There are many others.
{{< /r >}}

<!-- SOCRATES: What are they? tell me the names of them, as I would tell you the names of the other figures if you asked me. -->


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Yes, in searching after one virtue we have found many.

But we have been unable to find the common virtue which runs through them all.

**All things have a common notion.** 

For example, I ask you: what is figure? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
Figure is 'roundness'
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Is roundness 'figure' or 'a figure?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
A figure, because there are other figures
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What is color?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
Colour is whiteness.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Is whiteness colour or a colour?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
A colour, because there are other colours as well.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What are they?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
The colors other than white
{{< /r >}}

<!-- If he had said, Tell me what they are?—you would have told him of other colours which are colours just as much as whiteness. -->


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
But that is the wrong answer. 

You call them by a common name.

You say that they are all figures, even when opposed to one another.

What is that common nature which you call figure which contains straight and round, and is no more one than the other?

You do not mean to say that the round is round any more than straight, or the straight any more straight than round.

You only assert that the round figure is not more a figure than the straight, or the straight than the round.

To what then do we give the name of figure?

Suppose that when a person asked you this question about figure or colour
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
I will reply that I do not know what he is saying.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
He would reply that he is looking for the 'simile in multis'? 

What is that 'simile in multis' which you call figure, and which includes not only round and straight figures, but all? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Meno" >}}
I would rather that you should answer, Socrates.
{{< /r >}}
