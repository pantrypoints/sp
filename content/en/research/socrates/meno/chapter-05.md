<!-- {{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Had I the command of you as well as of myself, Meno, I would not have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not, until we had first ascertained 'what it is.'

But as you think only of controlling me who am your slave, and never of controlling yourself,—such being your notion of freedom, I must yield to you, for you are irresistible. And therefore I have now to enquire into the qualities of a thing of which I do not as yet know the nature.
{{< /l >}} -->


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Can the question 'Whether virtue is given by instruction, or in any other way,' be argued on hypothesis?

We ask a geometrician: Can a certain triangle can be drawn in a certain circle? Can a certain area be drawn as a triangle in a certain circle?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Geometrician" >}}
I will offer a hypothesis which may assist us in forming a conclusion: 

If the figure be such that when you have produced a given side of it (Or, when you apply it to the given line, i.e. the diameter of the circle (autou).), the given area of the triangle falls short by an area corresponding to the part produced (Or, similar to the area so applied.), then one consequence follows, and if this is impossible then some other;

Therefore I assume a hypothesis before I tell you whether this triangle is capable of being inscribed in the circle':—that is a geometrical hypothesis.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
We too do not know the nature and qualities of virtue.

We ask whether virtue is or is not taught, under a hypothesis. 

Thus, is virtue a class of mental goods, will it be taught or not?

Let the first hypothesis be that virtue is or is not knowledge,—in that case will it be taught or not? or, as we were just now saying, 'remembered'? 

For there is no use in disputing about the name. But is virtue taught or not? or rather, does not every one see that knowledge alone is taught?
{{< /l >}}


MENO: I agree.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then if virtue is knowledge, virtue will be taught?
{{< /l >}}


MENO: Certainly.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then now we have made a quick end of this question: if virtue is of such a nature, it will be taught; and if not, not?
{{< /l >}}


MENO: Certainly.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The next question is, whether virtue is knowledge or of another species?
{{< /l >}}


MENO: Yes, that appears to be the question which comes next in order.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
We say that virtue is a good. If there be any sort of good which is distinct from knowledge, virtue may be that good; but if knowledge embraces all good, then we shall be right in thinking that virtue is knowledge.  

If we are good, then we are profitable; for all good things are profitable. Then virtue is profitable.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then now let us see what are the things which severally profit us. Health and strength, and beauty and wealth—these, and the like of these, we call profitable.

Yet these things may also sometimes do us harm.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What is the guiding principle which makes them profitable or the reverse? Are they not profitable when they are rightly used, and hurtful when they are not rightly used?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Let us consider the goods of the soul: they are temperance, justice, courage, quickness of apprehension, memory, magnanimity, and the like?

Such of these as are not knowledge, but of another sort, are sometimes profitable and sometimes hurtful; as, for example, courage wanting prudence, which is only a sort of confidence? When a man has no sense he is harmed by courage, but when he has sense he is profited?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The same may be said of temperance and quickness of apprehension; whatever things are learned or done with sense are profitable, but when done without sense they are hurtful?

All that the soul attempts or endures, when under the guidance of wisdom, ends in happiness; but when she is under the guidance of folly, in the opposite?

If then virtue is a quality of the soul, and is admitted to be profitable, it must be wisdom or prudence, since none of the things of the soul are either profitable or hurtful in themselves, but they are all made profitable or hurtful by the addition of wisdom or of folly; and therefore if virtue is profitable, virtue must be a sort of wisdom or prudence?
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The other goods, such as wealth and the like, of which we were just now saying that they are sometimes good and sometimes evil, do not they also become profitable or hurtful, accordingly as the soul guides and uses them rightly or wrongly; just as the things of the soul herself are benefited when under the guidance of wisdom and harmed by folly?

The wise soul guides them rightly, and the foolish soul wrongly.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
And is not this universally true of human nature? All other things hang upon the soul, and the things of the soul herself hang upon wisdom, if they are to be good; and so wisdom is inferred to be that which profits—and virtue, as we say, is profitable?

Thus we arrive at the conclusion that virtue is either wholly or partly wisdom?

Then the good are not by nature good?
{{< /l >}}

MENO: I think not.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
If they had been, there would assuredly have been discerners of characters among us who would have known our future great men; and on their showing we should have adopted them, and when we had got them, we should have kept them in the citadel out of the way of harm, and set a stamp upon them far rather than upon a piece of gold, in order that no one might tamper with them; and when they grew up they would have been useful to the state?
{{< /l >}}


MENO: Yes, Socrates, that would have been the right way.

SOCRATES: But if the good are not by nature good, are they made good by instruction?

MENO: There appears to be no other alternative, Socrates. On the supposition that virtue is knowledge, there can be no doubt that virtue is taught.

SOCRATES: Yes, indeed; but what if the supposition is erroneous?

MENO: I certainly thought just now that we were right.

SOCRATES: Yes, Meno; but a principle which has any soundness should stand firm not only just now, but always.

MENO: Well; and why are you so slow of heart to believe that knowledge is virtue?

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I do not retract the assertion that if virtue is knowledge it may be taught; but I fear that I have some reason in doubting whether virtue is knowledge: for consider now and say whether virtue, and not only virtue but anything that is taught, must not have teachers and disciples?

Conversely, may not the art of which neither teachers nor disciples exist be assumed to be incapable of being taught?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Meno" >}}
True; but do you think that there are no teachers of virtue?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I have certainly often enquired whether there were any, and taken great pains to find them, and have never succeeded; and many have assisted me in the search, and they were the persons whom I thought the most likely to know. 

Here at the moment when he is wanted we fortunately have sitting by us Anytus, the very person of whom we should make enquiry; to him then let us repair.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
In the first place, he is the son of a wealthy and wise father, Anthemion, who acquired his wealth, not by accident or gift, like Ismenias the Theban (who has recently made himself as rich as Polycrates), but by his own skill and industry, and who is a well-conditioned, modest man, not insolent, or overbearing, or annoying; moreover, this son of his has received a good education, as the Athenian people certainly appear to think, for they choose him to fill the highest offices.

These are the sort of men from whom you are likely to learn whether there are any teachers of virtue, and who they are. Please, Anytus, to help me and your friend Meno in answering our question, Who are the teachers? Consider the matter thus: If we wanted Meno to be a good physician, to whom should we send him? Should we not send him to the physicians?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler, we should not send him to the cobblers. And so forth
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Let me trouble you with one more question. When we say that we should be right in sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be a physician, do we mean that we should be right in sending him to those who profess the art, rather than to those who do not, and to those who demand payment for teaching the art, and profess to teach it to any one who will come and learn? And if these were our reasons, should we not be right in sending him?
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Might not the same be said of flute-playing, and of the other arts? Would a man who wanted to make another a flute-player refuse to send him to those who profess to teach the art for money, and be plaguing other persons to give him instruction, who are not professed teachers and who never had a single disciple in that branch of knowledge which he wishes him to acquire—would not such conduct be the height of folly?
{{< /l >}}


ANYTUS: Yes, by Zeus, and of ignorance too.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Please advise me about my friend Meno. He has been telling me, Anytus, that he desires to attain that kind of wisdom and virtue by which men order the state or the house, and honour their parents, and know when to receive and when to send away citizens and strangers, as a good man should. 

To whom should he go in order that he may learn this virtue? Does not the previous argument imply clearly that we should send him to those who profess and avouch that they are the common teachers of all Hellas, and are ready to impart instruction to any one who likes, at a fixed price?

These are the people whom mankind call Sophists?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Anytus" >}}
By Heracles, Socrates, forbear! I only hope that no friend or kinsman or acquaintance of mine, whether citizen or stranger, will ever be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them; for they are a manifest pest and corrupting influence to those who have to do with them.
