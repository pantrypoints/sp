## 2.b. Let us go back to the beginning, and see the consequences that will follow.

If One is not, we ask what will happen in respect of one?

The words 'is not' signify an absence of being. When we say that a thing is not, we mean that it has no existence.<!-- , we mean that it is not in one way but is in another? or do we mean, absolutely, that what is not has in no sort or way or kind participation of being? -->

Then, that which is not cannot exist.

We said that:
- becoming was the assumption of existence
- being destroyed was the assumption of non-existence
<!-- - a non-existing thing can gain existence -->

Then one that is non-existing cannot lose or gain existence. It does not perish nor becomes, and is not altered at all.  

<!-- Then the one that is not, since it in no way partakes of being, neither perishes nor becomes? -->

<!-- Then it is not altered at all; for if it were it would become and be destroyed? -->

But if it be not altered then it cannot be moved. It does not stand if it is nowhere; for that which stands must always be in one and the same spot.

Then the one which is not never stands still and never moves.

Nor is there any existing thing which can be attributed to it; for if there had been, it would partake of being?

And therefore neither smallness, nor greatness, nor equality, can be attributed to it?

Nor yet likeness nor difference, either in relation to itself or to others?

Well, and if nothing should be attributed to it, can other things be attributed to it?

And therefore other things can neither be like or unlike, the same, or different in relation to it?

Nor can what is not, be anything, or be this thing, or be related to or the attribute of this or that or other, or be past, present, or future. Nor can knowledge, or opinion, or perception, or expression, or name, or any other thing that is, have any concern with it?

Then the One that is not has no condition of any kind.
