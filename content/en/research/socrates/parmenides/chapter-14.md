## 2.aa. If the One is an Illusion, what becomes of the Others?

<!-- The Others must surely be; for if they, like the one, were not, we could not be now speaking of them. -->

<!-- But to speak of the others implies difference—the terms 'other' and 'different' are synonymous?

Other means other than other, and different, different from the different?

Then, if there are to be others, there is something than which they will be other?

And what can that be?—for if the one is not, they will not be other than the one. -->

The Others become other than each Other, for the only remaining alternative is that they are other than nothing.

They are each Other than one another, as being plural and not singular. If One is an Illusion, then the Others cannot be singular. Instead, every particle of them is infinite in number. 

Even if you take the smallest fraction, which seemed one, in a moment, it splits up <!-- evanesces --> into many as in a dream. From being the smallest, it becomes very large, relative to the fractions into which it is split up.

If the One is an Illusion:
- there will be many particles, each appearing to be one, but not being one
- in such particles, the Others will be other than one another<!-- , if others are, and the one is not? -->
- there will seem to be odd and even among them, which will also have no reality

It would seem that number can be predicated of them if each of them appears to be one, though it is really many?

There will appear to be a least among them; and even this will seem large and manifold compared to the many small fractions contained in it.

Each particle will be imagined to be equal to the many and little. for it could not have appeared to pass from the greater to the less without having appeared to arrive at the middle; and thus would arise the appearance of equality.

Having neither beginning, middle, nor end, each separate particle yet appears to have a limit in relation to itself and other.

Because, when a person conceives of any one of these as such, prior to the beginning another beginning appears, and there is another end, remaining after the end, and in the middle truer middles within but smaller, because no unity can be conceived of any of them, since the one is not.

so all being, whatever we think of, must be broken up into fractions, for a particle will have to be conceived of without unity?

And such being when seen indistinctly and at a distance, appears to be one; 

But when seen near and with keen intellect, every single thing appears to be infinite, since it is deprived of the one, which is not.

Then each of the others must appear to be infinite and finite, and one and many, if others than the one exist and not the one.

They will appear to be like and unlike.

Just as in a picture things appear to be all one to a person standing at a distance, and to be in the same state and alike.

But when you approach them, they appear to be many and different. Because of the appearance of the difference, different in kind from, and unlike, themselves.

The particles appear to be like and unlike themselves and each other.

They are the same yet different from one another:
- in contact with themselves, although they are separated, and having every sort of motion, and every sort of rest, and becoming and being destroyed, and in neither state, and the like, all which things may be easily enumerated, if the one is not and the many are
