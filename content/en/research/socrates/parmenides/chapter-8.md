<!-- And that which differs in age from some other less than formerly, from being older will become younger in relation to that other than which it was older.

And if the one becomes younger the others aforesaid will become older than they were before, in relation to the one.

Then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which previously had become and was older; 

it never really is older, but is always becoming, for the one is always growing on the side of youth and the other on the side of age. 
 -->

Is the One becoming older and younger than the Others, and the Others being younger and older than the one?

An age gap between two things in the present will still be the same age gap in the future. This is because the future implies that the same amount of timespan is added to both things*.


{{< n n="A 1-year old and a 6 year-old today will be a 2-year old and a 7-year old next year with the same age gap" >}}


But this age gap can change through a change in perspective, in the same way that we said:
- that the One, as the Whole, was relatively older than the Others
- that the Others were older than the One, as the Beginning.  


## Changing Age by Changing Perspectives

The One, as the Whole, has experienced more timelines than the Others.

The One, as the Others, has experienced only one timeline each.

If we add an equal timespan to the aggregate of these timelines and to the single timeline, then the aggregate timeline will differ from the single timeline by a smaller portion than before.

{{< n n="The number of timelines is the divisor " >}}


Then the difference between the age of the One as the Whole and the age of the Others, taken individually, will not be afterwards so great as at first. They will differ less and less in age if the same timespan is added successively to their timelines. 

In this way, the age gap between the One as the Whole, and the One as the Others, will be less*.


{{< n n="In Hinduism and Buddhism, this is implemented by reducing or eliminating time from one's timeline instead of adding it. The mind is trained to negate time, by going into deep meditation which reduces perception and experience. This brings the mind gradually closer to the The Whole as the Brahma. Parmenides adds time to timelines to unite the Self with the Whole because he takes the viewpoint of the The Whole" >}}


The One, as the Whole, which was previously growing older from the perspective of the Others, is now becoming younger relative to those Others due to a change in perspective. This means that the Others will become older relative to the One, as the Whole.

<!-- If the One, as the Whole, becomes younger, --> 

<!-- Then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which previously had become and was older; it never really is older, but is always becoming, for the one is always growing on the side of youth and the other on the side of age.

This means that by switching perspective from the One that is the Others, into the One that is Whole, the Others  -->

Those Others are not really older, but are merely always becoming. This is because the One, as the Whole, is always growing young, and the One, as the Others, are always growing old.

<!-- Then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which previously had become and was older;  -->

<!-- Similarly, the older One, as the Whole, is always becoming younger --> <!-- than the younger; --> This means they are always going in opposite directions= <!-- They become in ways the opposite to one another, --> 
- the younger Whole is older than the older Others
- the older Others are younger than the younger Whole

<!-- They cannot, however, have become; for if they had already become they would be and not merely become. 

But that is impossible; for they are always becoming both older and younger than one another=  -->

- The One, as the Whole, becomes younger than the One, as the Others, because It was seen to be older and prior. 
- The One, as the Others, become older than the One, as the Beginning, because they came into being later. 

In the same way, the One, as the Others, are in the same relation to the One, as the Whole, because they were seen to be older, and prior to the one.

If two differently-aged things were observed from the same timeline from the perspective of the Others, then then their age gap will not change as time passes. 

But if two differently-aged things occupied two different timelines and was observed from the perspective of the Whole, then their relative age must continually differ from each other by a different proportion.

Thus, the One, as the Others, is and becomes older and younger than Itself and the Others. But the One, as the Whole, neither is nor becomes older or younger than Itself or the Others.

But since the One experiences time and becomes older and younger, then it must also experience past, present, and future.

Then the One <!-- was and is and will be, and --> was becoming and is becoming and will become.

There is and was and will be something which is in relation to it and belongs to it.

Since we have at this moment opinion and knowledge and perception of the One, there is opinion and knowledge and perception of it.

Then there is a name and expression for it. Everything of this kind which appertains to other things appertains to the One.
