{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then come impeachments and trials of one another. The people always have some champion whom they nurse into greatness. **This is the only root from which a tyrant springs.**

When he first appears, he is a protector. 

There is a tale of a man in the Arcadian temple of Lycaean Zeus. He tasted the entrails of a human victim minced up with those of other victims and became a wolf.

Likewise, a protector changes into a tyrant when he tastes the blood of his human victims. 

The protector has a mob at his disposal. He is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen.

His favourite method is false accusation. He uses this to bring his kinsmen to court to be murdered or banished.  <!-- them and tastes the blood of his fellow citizens. He kills some and banishes others. --> 

At the same time, he hints at the abolition of debts and partition of lands. After this, he will either perish at the hands of his enemies or become a wolf--a tyrant.

This is the same as the drone who begins to make a party against the rich. After a while, he is driven out, but comes back as a full-grown tyrant. 

If they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him. Then comes the famous request for a body-guard. 

All successful tyrants have this device. But when the wealthy man is also accused of being an enemy of the people, he flees and is not ashamed to be a coward.

<!-- —as they say= 'Let not the people's friend be lost to them.'
The people readily assent.
All their fears are for him—they have none for themselves. -->
<!-- , as the oracle said to Croesus.
Quite right too, for if he were, he would never be ashamed again. -->
The protector is <!-- seen not 'larding the plain' with his bulk, but himself --> the overthrower of many. He stands up in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector, but tyrant absolute.

What is the happiness of the man, and the State under Tyranny?

In the early days of his power, he is full of smiles and salutes everyone he meets. He makes promises in public and in private! He liberates debtors and distributes land to the people and his followers, wanting to be so kind and good to everyone! 


After the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty<!-- , and there is nothing to fear from them -->, he starts stirring up some war so that the people may require a leader. 

He impoverishes the people with taxes so that they would focus on their daily needs and would be less likely to conspire against him. 

If he suspects them of resistance, he will destroy them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy. Because of these, the tyrant must always be getting up a war.

Now he begins to grow unpopular. Then some of his supporters who are in power, speak their minds to him and to each other. The tyrant then gets rid of them.

He purges the State <!-- cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything. Therefore he must look about him and see who is --> of the valiant, high-minded, wise, and wealthy. It is a purgation that removes the better part and leaves the worse, opposite from the one done by physicians. It would be better for the tyrant's supporters to support him than to be purged!

## The Corruption of the People, including the Philosophers

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
<!-- The more detestable his actions are to the citizens, the greater devotion he will require.  -->
The citizens will only flock to him if he pays them. And so drones of every sort come from every land.

But he will desire to get them on the spot. He will rob the citizens of their slaves. He will then set them free and enroll them in his body-guard. 

He has killed the others and has these for his trusted friends. These are the new citizens who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and avoid him.

Euripides was a tragedian who said: 'Tyrants are wise by living with the wise.' He meant that the tyrant's companions are wise. Thus, tragedy is a wise thing.

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Yes, Euripides also praises tyranny as godlike. Many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The tragic poets are wise men who will forgive us if we do not receive them into our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.

But they will continue to go to other cities to:
- attract mobs,
- hire fair, loud, and persuasive voices, and
- draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies.

Tyrants pay the most for such poets and give them the most honour. Democracies pay them a bit less. 

But the higher those poets ascend our constitution hill, the more their reputation fails. From shortness of breath, they are unable to proceed further. 

How will the tyrant maintain his numerous ever-changing army?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
He will confiscate sacred treasures in the city and sell them to reduce the taxes on the people. 

If these fail, then he and his boon companions will be maintained by his father's estate and family. <!-- His family will maintain him and his companions. -->

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
But what if the people declare that a grown-up son should not be supported by his father, but that the father should be supported by the son?

The father raised his son to protect him and be free from the government of the rich and aristocratic. 

He did not raise his son to be the servant of his own servants, nor to remain dependent on him. And so he tells his son and his companions to leave<!-- , just as any other father might drive out a riotous son and his undesirable associates -->. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
By heaven, then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom. When he wants to drive him out, he will find that he is weak and his son strong. 

The tyrant will use violence and beat his father if he opposes him.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent. 

This is real tyranny. 

The people who escaped the smoke of the slavery of freemen then fall into the fire of the tyranny of slaves. 

Thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery.
