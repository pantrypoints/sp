Your words command my entire sympathy, when you bid us endeavour to begin each work with heaven's help, (1) seeing that the gods hold in their hands the issues alike of peace and war. 

<!-- So at any rate will we endeavour to act at all times; but will you now endeavour on your side to continue the discussion of economy from the point at which you broke off, and bring it point by point to its conclusion? What you have said so far has not been thrown away on me. I seem to discern already more clearly, what sort of behaviour is necessary to anything like real living.  -->

<!-- Socrates= What say you then? Shall we first survey the ground already traversed, and retrace the steps on which we were agreed, so that, if possible we may conduct the remaining portion of the argument to its issue with like unanimity? (3) (3) Lit. "try whether we can go through the remaining steps with like..."  -->

Should 2 business partners run through their accounts without dispute, so now as partners in an argument it will be no less agreeable to sum up the points under discussion, as you say, with unanimity.

We agreed that "economy" was the proper title of a branch of knowledge whereby men are enabled to enhance the value of their houses or estates.

"House or estate" means all of a man's possessions. 

"Possessions" means those things which are advantageous for life to the possessor. 

"Advantageous things" mean all that a man knows how to use and quantify <!-- turn to good account -->. 

It is impossible for a man to learn all branches of knowledge.

The civil communities rejected the base mechanic arts because they destroy the bodies of the artisans and crush their spirits. And so we reject such arts.

This is proven by comparing the husbandmen and the artisans. Ask each group: 'Is it better to defend our country districts, or to retire from the fields and guard the walls?'

The husbandmen and farmers would vote to defend the soil. The artisans would vote not to fight. They will instead sit with folded hands neither expending toil nor venturing their lives. 

A gentleman's best employment is husbandry as it lets human beings procure the necessaries of life. 

It is the easiest to learn and the pleasantest to follow since it gives beauty and hardihood to the limbs whilst permitting to the soul leisure to satisfy the claims of friendship and of civic duty.

Husbandry spurs bravery of those who till the fields, inasmuch as the necessaries of life, vegetable and animal, under her auspices spring up and are reared outside the fortified defences of the city. 

This is why this way of life stood in the highest repute in the eyes of statesmen and commonwealths, as furnishing the best citizens<!--  and those best disposed to the common weal -->.

Yes, I am convinced in making agriculture the basis of life. It is the noblest, best, and pleasantest to do so. 

But how can husbandry make one wealthy and not poor? 
<!-- I should like to revert to your remark that you understood the reason why the tillage of one man brings him in an abundance of all he needs, while the operations of another fail to make husbandry a profitable employment. 

I would gladly hear from you an explanation of both these points, so that I may adopt the right and avoid the harmful course.  -->

<!-- {{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Soc. Well, Critobulus, suppose I narrate to you from the beginning how I cam in contact with a man who of all men I ever met seemed to me to deserve the appellation of a gentleman. He was indeed a "beautiful and good" man.

{{< r a="Critobulus" >}}
Crit. There is nothing I should better like to hear, since of all titles this is the one I covet most the right to bear.

I will tell you about Ischomachus. It did not take me long to go the round of various good carpenters, good bronze-workers, painters, sculptors, and so forth. 

<!-- A brief period was sufficient for the contemplation of themselves and of their most admired works of art.  -->

I tried to find which occupation was really <!-- But when it came to examining those who bore the high-sounding title --> "beautiful and good." So I talked to <!-- in order to find out what conduct on their part justified their adoption of this title, I found my soul eager with desire for intercourse with --> each one of them.

<!-- ; and first of all, seeing that the epithet "beautiful" was conjoined with that of "good," every beautiful person I saw, I must needs approach in my endeavour to discover, (12) if haply I might somewhere see the quality of good adhering to the quality of beauty. 

But, after all, it was otherwise ordained.  -->

<!-- I soon enough seemed to discover (13) that some of those who in their outward form were beautiful were in their inmost selves the veriest knaves. Accordingly I made up my mind to let go beauty which appeals to the eye, and address myself to one of those "beautiful and good" people so entitled.  -->

I heard that Ischomachus was called "beautiful and good" (14) by all the world, both men and women, foreigners and citizens alike. So I met up with him.
