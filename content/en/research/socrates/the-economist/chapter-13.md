But now (I ventured), suppose you have presented strongly to the mind of some one (1) the need of carefulness to execute your wishes, is a person so qualified to be regarded as fit at once to be your bailiff? 

or is there aught else which he must learn in order to play the part of an efficient bailiff? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
Most certainly there is. It still remains for him to learn particulars—to know, that is, what things he has to do, and when and how to do them; or else, if ignorant of these details, the profit of this bailiff in the abstract may prove no greater than the doctor's who pays a most precise attention to a sick man, visiting him late and early, but what will serve to ease his patient's pains (2) he knows not.

Soc. But suppose him to have learnt the whole routine of business, will he need aught else, or have we found at last your bailiff absolute?

{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
He must learn at any rate, I think, to rule his fellow-workmen.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
What! You educate your bailiffs to that extent? Actually you make them capable of rule? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
At any rate I try to do so.

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
How do you contrive to educate another in the skill to govern human beings? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
I have a very simple system that you will simply laugh at me.

<!--  Soc. The matter, I protest, is hardly one for laughter. The man who can make another capable of rule, clearly can teach him how to play the master; and if can make him play the master, he can make him what is grander still, a kingly being. (4) Once more, therefore, I protest= A man possessed of such creative power is worthy, not of ridicule, far from it, but of the highest praise.  -->


<!-- (4) i.e. {arkhikos} includes (1) {despotikos}, i.e. an arbitrary head of any sort, from the master of one's own family to the {turannos kai despotes} (Plat. "Laws," 859 A), despotic lord or owner; the king or monarch gifted with regal qualities.  -->

The lower animals are taught obedience by 2 methods chiefly:
- partly through being punished when they disobey
- partly by experiencing some kindness when they cheerfully submit. 

This is the principle used in the breaking of young horses. 

The animal obeys its trainer. Something sweet is sure to follow. If it disobeys, it finds a peck of trouble. This is done until it yields obedience to the trainer's every wish. 

Young dogs are <!-- (6) --> far inferior to man in thought and language. <!-- (7) --> They can still be taught to run on errands and turn somersaults, <!-- (8) --> and do other clever things using this same principle of training. 

Every time the animal obeys, it gets something that it wanted. Everytime it misbehaves, it gets a whipping.

{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
But humans are more open to persuasion through appeals to reason. ; (9) only make it plain to him "it is his interest to obey." 

Or if they happen to be slaves, (10) the more ignoble training of wild animals tamed to the lure will serve to teach obedience. 

Only gratify their bellies in the matter of appetite, and you will succeed in winning much from them. 

<!-- (11) --> 

But ambitious, emulous natures feel the spur of praise, <!-- (12) --> since some natures hunger after praise no less than others crave for meats and drinks. 

My practice is to instruct those whom I desire to appoint as my bailiffs in the various methods which I have found myself to be successful in gaining the obedience of my fellows.

{{< r a="Ischomachus" >}}
For example, I have to provide clothes, entertainment, etc to my workers. <!-- (13) --> 

I see to it that these are not all alike in make. Some <!-- ; (14) but some --> will be of better, some of less good quality. 

These articles shall vary with the service of the wearer. The worse man will receive the worse things as a gift. The better man the better as a mark of honour. 

Good people become despondent when they see <!--  seeing that the work is wrought by their own hands alone, in spite of which these --> villains who do no labour nor face danger receive an equal <!-- guerdon --> reward as themselves who work so hard. 

And just as I cannot bring myself in any sort of way to look upon the better sort as worthy to receive no greater honour than the baser, so, too,

And so I praise my bailiffs when they have apportioned the best things to the most deserving. 

If I see that someone is receiving preference by flatteries or unworthy means, I do not let the matter pass. I reprimand my bailiff roundly, and teach him that such conduct is not even to his interest.
