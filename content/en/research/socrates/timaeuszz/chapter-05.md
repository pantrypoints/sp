(55d - 57d)

Let us distribute the kinds mentioned in our discourse into fire, earth, water, and air. 

Let us assign the cubic form to earth, for earth is the most immovable of the four kinds and the most plastic of bodies; 

It must necessarily be of such a nature as to have the firmest foundations. And the base composed of the initially posited triangles is naturally more stable if it is composed of equal sides rather than unequal ones. 

Thus, the plane surface formed by equilateral and equilateral triangular bases is necessarily the most stable both in parts and as a whole. 

<!-- Therefore, assigning this to earth, we preserve the likely account.  -->

To water, of the remaining forms, the one that is least movable; 

to fire, the one that is most movable;

to air, the intermediate form. 

The smallest body to fire, the largest to water, and the intermediate one to air.

The sharpest, likewise, to fire, the next sharpest to air, and the third to water. 

Thus, everything that has the fewest bases must necessarily be the most movable, [56b] the most cutting and sharpest in every direction, and the lightest, being composed of the fewest similar parts. 

The second kind holds these qualities secondarily, and the third kind thirdly. According to correct reasoning and the likely account, let the solid form of the pyramid be the element and seed of fire; the second in order of generation, we shall call air, and the third, water.



### Types (58c - 60b)

Many kinds of fire have come into being, such as flame and the light that comes from the flame, which does not burn but provides light to the eyes, and the one left behind when the flame is extinguished in glowing embers.

Similarly with air, the clearest kind is called aether, while the murkiest is called mist and darkness, as well as other unnamed kinds. These are caused by the inequality of their triangles. 

The kinds of water are divided first into two: 

1. The liquid kind

This consists of small, unequal parts. It is both mobile in itself and movable by other things due to its irregularity and form. 

2. The fusible kind

This consists of large, smooth parts is more stationary and heavy, being solidified by its smoothness. 

But when fire enters and dissolves it, it loses its smoothness and becomes more mobile. 

Becoming easy to move, it is pushed by the nearby air and stretched towards the earth. 

The melting is called the dissolution of its bulk. The flow towards the earth is called by the name of each effect. [59a]

When fire leaves it again, since it does not go into a void, the nearby air, still being easy to move, pushes the liquid bulk into the positions of the fire, mixing it with itself.

Being pushed together and regaining its smoothness again, since the creator of the irregularity, fire, is leaving, it returns to its original state.

The departure of fire is called cooling. 

The fusion that occurs when it leaves is called solidification.


### Movement and Rest (57d - 58c)

<!-- Concerning movement and rest, the manner in which they come into being and the entities with which they occur must be understood. 

If this is not agreed upon, [57e] there would be many obstacles to the subsequent reasoning. 

Therefore, what has already been said about them stands, and in addition to those points, the following must be added:  -->

Never to assume that movement occurs in uniformity. It is impossible for something to move without something to move it, or for the mover to exist without something to be moved. 

<!-- Movement cannot exist in the absence of these things, and  -->

It is impossible for movement to be uniform at any time.

Therefore, we should always place:
- rest in uniformity
- movement in irregularity. 

The cause of the irregularity is inequality. 

We have discussed the generation of inequality, but how each thing, not being separated according to kinds, ceases moving and interacting with each other, we have not explained. 

The circular motion of the universe, encompassing all kinds, being circular and desiring to converge upon itself, compresses everything and allows no empty space to remain.

Therefore, fire has penetrated everywhere the most, air second, as it is second in fineness, and the others in this order.

Those composed of the largest parts leave the most void in their structure, while the smallest leave the least. 

The unification of the compression pushes the small parts into the gaps of the large ones. 

When the small are placed beside the large, the lesser parts separate the larger ones, while the larger ones combine those, everything is transferred up and down to their respective places. 

Each changing its size also changes its position. 

Thus, the generation of irregularity, always being preserved, continually ensures that the movement of these things always is and will be perpetually ongoing.


### Kinds of Earth (60b - 61c)


The types of earth, when mixed with water in this manner, become a stony substance. The mixed water, when cut during mixing, transforms into the appearance of air. [60c] 

Once it becomes air, it ascends to its place. Nothing remains empty of them. Therefore, it pushes the nearby air. 

The air, being heavy, is pushed and, surrounding the mass of the earth, presses it strongly and compacts it into the spaces from where the new air ascended. 

Pressed by the air and fused inseparably with the water, earth becomes a rock, more beautiful when its parts are equal and transparent, and uglier when the opposite. When the moist [60d] part is quickly extracted by fire and it forms a more brittle mass, which we call by the name of pottery, it is formed. 

Sometimes, when a residue of moisture is left behind and the earth, when melted by fire, cools down, it becomes a stone with a black color. 

These things, in the same manner, are separated from the mixture of water in great amounts, but with finer parts of earth, being salty, becoming semi-solid and again dissolving under water, forming the cleansing substance of oil and earth, called natron. [60e] 

Another, suitable in combination with the senses around the mouth, becomes the sacred body of salt. 

The common substances formed from both water and earth are not dissolved by water, but by fire. The mass of earth is not melted by fire or air; because of its structure of small interstices, they pass through it with ample space, without pressure, leaving it solid and unmelted. Water, having larger parts, forces its way through, dissolving and melting it. [61a]

Earth in a non-compacted state is thus dissolved only by the force of water, but when compacted, nothing dissolves it except fire; only fire is left as an entrance for it. 

The union of water, in its most forceful form, is dissolved only by fire, and in a weaker form, by both fire and air, which permeate it through the interstices and triangles. No force other than elemental dissolves compressed air, but fire alone melts it without force. 

The mixed bodies of earth and water, as long as water holds the interstices of earth together, remain unmelted when water from outside cannot enter. 

But fire entering the interstices of water, like water to earth, dissolves the mixed body, causing it to flow. 

These substances, when having less water than earth, [61c] are found in all glass-like forms and kinds of stone called fusible. Those with more water, all wax-like and aromatic bodies, are compacted."
