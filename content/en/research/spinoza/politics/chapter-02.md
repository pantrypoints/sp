<!-- [Natural Right] -->


{{< s v="1" >}} My Tractatus theologico-politicus dealt with natural rightl and civil right.

My Ethics explained what is sin, righteousness, justice, injustice, human freedom.

I will explain them here to save you time. 

<!-- But to save the readers of this treatise the trouble of consulting other works for things that are most closely concerned with this treatise, I have decided to explain them here once more, presenting logical proof. -->

<!-- 6 ["State" here translates the latin impenum. (from imperare, "to command"), which ID pnnclpie
refers to the adlTIlDlstration of civil power In Hobbes It IS often translated as "sovereign" or "sovereignty." but the latter IS preferable, since for both Hobbes and Spmoza the sovereign power IS not a
person, though Its adrruDistration may be vested In one person or many 1

<!-- ## Chapter 2  -->

{{< s v="2" >}} Any natural thing can be adequately conceived, whether it actually exists or not. 

<!-- The  of natural things cannot be concluded from  -->

Their definitions do not explain:
- their coming into existence
- their persistence in existing

This is because their essential idea is the same before and while existing. 

 <!-- so neither can their perseverance in existing; for their essence in the form of idea is the same after they have begun to exist as it was before they existed.  -->

Therefore, their coming into existence and persistence cannot follow from their essence.

 <!-- so neither can their perseverance in existing.  -->

The same power they need to begin to exist, they also need to continue to exist.

Hence God's eternal power is the cause of natural things to exist and act. 

 <!-- by which they exist, and consequently by which they act, can be no other than the  of . -->

Any other power would not be able to preserve its own self.

<!-- For if it were some other power, itself created, it , and consequently it would not be able to preserve natural things; it would itself stand in need of that same power to persevere in existing as it needed to be created. -->


{{< s v="3" >}} We can understand the right of Nature from the power of God.

<!-- So from the fact that the power of natural things by which they exist and act is the very power of God, we can readily -->

God has right over all things.

God's right is nothing other than God's power insofar as that is considered as absolutely free.

It follows that every natural thing has as much right from Nature as it has power to exist and to act.

For the power of every natural thing by which it exists and acts is nothing other than the power of God, which is absolutely free.


{{< s v="4" >}} The right of Nature is the laws of Nature that allows things to exist. It is the very power of Nature. 

<!-- in accordance with which all things come to be; that is, the  -->

So the natural right of Nature and the natural right of every individual is coextensive with its power. 6 

Consequently, whatever each man does from the laws of his own nature, he does by the sovereign right of Nature.
- He has as much right over Nature as his power extends.


{{< s v="5" >}} So if human nature were so constituted that men lived only as reason prescribes and attempted nothing other than that, then the right of Nature, insofar as that is considered as specific to man , would be determined solely by the power of reason.

But men are led by blind desire more than by reason.

Therefore their natural power or right must be defined not by reason but by appetite.
- This appetite drives them to act and preserve themselves. 

I do indeed admit that in the case of those desires that do not arise from reason, men are not so much active as passive. 

But since we are here discussing the universal power or right of Nature, we cannot acknowledge any difference between desires that are engendered in us by reason and those arising from other causes. 

For in both cases they are the effects of Nature.

 explicating the natural force whereby man strives to persist in his own being ignorant, he is a part of Nature, and everything whereby a man is determined to act should be referred to the power of Nature insofar as this power is expressed through the nature of this or that man.

For whether a man is led by reason or solely by desire, he does nothing that is not in accordance with the laws and rules of Nature, that is (Section 4 of this Chapter), he acts by the right of Nature.

[in suo esse" The conatus, or dnve for self-preservation, IS the actual essence of the human mdivldual, accordmg to E3 P7, and the source of both acbon and passion (E5P4Schol) 1  -->



{{< s v="6" >}} Yet most people believe that the ignorant violate the order of Nature rather than conform to it.

 <!-- in Nature as -->
They think of wild men are a state within a state. 

They believe that the human mind:
- is not produced by natural causes.
- is directly created by God
- is so independent of other things that it has an absolute power9 to determine itself and to use reason in a correct way.

But experience teaches us only too well that it is no more in our power to have a sound mind than to have a sound body. 

Each thing endeavours to preserve its own being.

If it were equally in our power to live at reason's behest as to be led by blind desire, all would be led by reason and would order their lives wisely, which is by no means the case. 

For everyone is drawn by his own pleasure. Nor do theologians remove this difficulty by mainta ining that the cause of this weakness in human nature is the vice or sin whose origin was the fall of our first parent.

For if the first man, too, had as much power to stand as to fall, and ifhe was in his right mind and with his nature unimpaired, how could it have come about that knowingly and deliberately he fell? 

Their answer is that he was deceived by the Devil. But who was it who deceived the Devil Who, I ask, caused the one who was the most outstanding of all intelligent creatures to become so insane that he willed to be greater than God? Did not
he, who had a sound mind, endeavour to preserve himself and his own being, as far as in him lay?

Again, how could it have come about that the first man himself,
being of sound mind and master of his own will, allowed himself to be led astray and beguiled? 

If he had the power to use reason aright, he could not have been deceived, for, as far as in him lay he must have endeavoured to preserve his own being and his sound mind. 

But, by hypothesis, this was in fact within his power; therefore he must have preserved his sound mind and could not have been deceived. His history, however, shows this to be false. 

And so it must be admitted that it was not in the power of the first man to use reason aright, and that, like us, he
was subject to passions.

{{< s v="7" >}} Man, like other individual things, endeavours to preserve his own being as far as in him lies. 

For if there could here be any possible difference, it would have to arise from man's having a free will. Yet the more free we conceived man to be, the more we were compelled to maintain that he must necessarily preserve himself and be of sound mind, as will readily be granted by everyone who does not confuse freedom with contingency.

Freedom is virtue or perfection.
 

So anything that signifies weakness in man cannot be referred to his freedom. 

Therefore a man can certainly not be called free on the grounds that he is able not to exist, or that he is able not to use his reason; he can be called free only insofar as he has the powerl2 to exist and to act in accordance with the laws of human nature. 

So the more free we consider a man to be, the less we can say that he is able not to use his reason and to choose evil before good; and so God, who exists, understands, and acts with absolute freedom, also exists, understands, and acts necessarily, that is, from the necessity of his own nature. 

For there is no doubt that God acts with the same freedom with which he exists.

Therefore, as he exists from the necessity of his own nature, so he also acts from the necessity of his own nature; that is, he acts from absolute freedom.
