{{< q >}}
Their waters were mingled together…
Gods were formed in their midst:
God LAHMU and god LAHAMU were brought forth;
By name they were called.
{{< /q >}}



Etymologically, the names of these 2 planets stem from the root LHM ("to make war"). 

The ancients gave us the tradition that:
- Mars was the God of War
- Venus the Goddess of both Love and War. 


LAHMU and LAHAMU are male and female names, respectively.*

<!-- As the "missing planet," Tiamat was located beyond Mars. 

Mars and Venus are located in the space between the Sun (Apsu) and "Tiamat." We can illustrate this by following the Sumerian celestial map. (Figs. 102, 103) -->

<!-- Illustration:
In the Beginning: Sun, Mercury, Tiamat.
Illustration:
The Inner Planets—the „Gods in the Midst“—come forth. -->


<!-- The process of the formation of the solar system then went on.  -->

<!-- Lahmu and Lahamu—Mars and Venus-were brought forth, but even Before they had grown in age And in stature to an appointed size— -->


{{< q >}}
God ANSHAR and god KISHAR were formed, surpassing them [in size].
As lengthened the days and multiplied the years,
God ANU became their son—of his ancestors a rival.
Then Anshar's first-born, Anu, as his equal and in his image begot NUDIMMUD.

<!-- With a terseness matched only by the narrative's precision, Act I of the epic of Creation has been swiftly played out before our very eyes. We are informed that  -->

<!-- Mars and Venus were to grow only to a limited size. But even before their formation was complete, another pair of planets was formed.  -->

The two, which I think are Saturn and Jupiter, were majestic planets:
- AN.SHAR ("prince, foremost of the heavens") 
- KI.SHAR ("foremost of the firm lands"). 

They overtook in size the first pair, "surpassing them" in stature. 

<!-- The description, epithets, and location of this second pair easily identify them as Saturn and Jupiter. (Fig. 104). -->

<!-- Illustration:
The SHAR‘s—the Giant Planets—are created, together with their Emissary. -->


After some time, a third pair of planets was brought forth. 

First came ANU, smaller than Anshar and Kishar ("their son"), but larger than the first planets ("of his ancestors a rival" in size). 




Then Anu, in turn, begot a twin planet, "his equal and in his image." 


The Babylonian version calls it NUDIMMUD, an epithet of Ea/Enki. 

I think these are Uranus and Neptune.





Anu was "Anshar's first-born." This means it had later children. 

 <!-- implying that there was yet another planetary god "born" to Anshar/Saturn.  -->

<!-- The epic catches up with this celestial deity later on, when it relates how  -->

Anshar then sent out his emissary GAGA on various missions to the other planets. 

Gaga appears in function and stature equal to Apsu's emissary Mummu.

I think this brings to mind the similarities between Mercury and Pluto. 

Gaga, then, was Pluto.

But the Sumerians placed Pluto on their celestial map not beyond Neptune, but next to Saturn, whose "emissary," or satellite, it was. (Fig. 105) 


As Act I of the "Epic of Creation" came to an end, there was a solar system made up of the Sun and 9 planets:


Name | Stitchin Body | Superphysics Body | Description 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Apsu | Sun | 1st Element | "one who existed from the beginning."
Mummu | MERCURY | 4th Element | counselor and emissary of Apsu.
Lahamu | VENUS | Positive Charge | "lady of battles"
Lahmu | MARS | Negative Charge | "deity of war"
Tiamat | ? | 3rd Element | "maiden who gave life."
Kishar | JUPITER | Jupiter | "foremost of firm lands."
Anshar | SATURN | Saturn | "foremost of the heavens."
Gaga | PLUTO | ? | counselor and emissary of Anshar.
Anu | URANUS | Uranus | "he of the heavens."
Nudimmud (Ea) | NEPTUNE | Neptune | "artful creator."



The Earth and the Moon are yet to be created, products of the forthcoming cosmic collision.

<!-- With the end of the majestic drama of the birth of the planets, the authors of the Creation epic now raise the curtain on Act II, on a drama of celestial turmoil. -->

<!-- The newly created family of planets was far from being stable.  -->

The planets were gravitating toward each other. They were converging on Tiamat, disturbing and endangering the primordial bodies. 

{{< q >}}
The divine brothers banded together;
They disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth.
They were troubling the "belly" of Tiamat
By their antics in the dwellings of heaven.
Apsu could not lessen their clamor;
Tiamat was speechless at their ways.
Their doings were loathsome…
Troublesome were their ways.
{{< /q >}}


These are references to erratic orbits which interfered with Tiamat's orbit.

<!-- . The new planets "surged back and forth"; they got too close to each other ("banded together"); they ; they got too close to her "belly"; their "ways" were troublesome. -->

Though it was Tiamat that was principally endangered, Apsu, too, found the planets' ways "loathsome." 

He announced his intention to "destroy, wreck their ways." He huddled with Mummu, conferred with him in secret. 

But "whatever they had plotted between them" was overheard by the gods, and the plot to destroy them left them speechless. 

The only one who did not lose his wits was Ea. 

He devised a ploy to "pour sleep on Apsu." 

When the other celestial gods liked the plan, Ea "drew a faithful map of the universe" and cast a divine spell upon the primeval waters of the solar system.

What was this "spell" or force exerted by "Ea" (the planet Neptune)—then the outermost planet—as it orbited the Sun and circled all the other planets? 

Did its own orbit around the Sun affect the Sun's magnetism and thus its radioactive outpourings? Or did Neptune itself emit, upon its creation, some vast radiations of energy? 

Whatever the effects were, the epic likened them to a "pouring of sleep"—a calming effect—upon Apsu (the Sun). 

Even "Mummu, the Counsellor, was powerless to stir."

<!-- As in the biblical tale of Samson and Delilah, the hero—overcome by sleep—could easily be robbed of his powers.  -->

Ea moved quickly to rob Apsu of his creative role. 

Quenching, it seems, the immense outpourings of primeval matter from the Sun, Ea/Neptune "pulled off Apsu's tiara, removed his cloak of aura." 

Apsu was "vanquished." 

Mummu could no longer roam about. He was "bound and left behind," a lifeless planet by his master's side.

By depriving the Sun of its creativity—stopping the process of emitting more energy and matter to form additional planets—the gods brought temporary peace to the solar system. 

The victory was further signified by changing the meaning and location of the Apsu. This epithet was henceforth to be applied to the "Abode of Ea." 

Any additional planets could henceforth come only from the new Apsu—from "the Deep"—the far reaches of space that the outermost planet faced.
