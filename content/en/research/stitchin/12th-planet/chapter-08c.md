Mesopotamian texts exalted Marduk's radiance and suggested that it could be seen even at daytime: "visible at sunrise, disappearing from view at sunset." 

A cylinder seal, found at Nippur, depicts a group of plowmen looking up with awe as the 12th Planet (depicted with its cross symbol) is visible in the skies. (Fig. 113)

The ancient peoples not only expected the periodic arrival of the 12th Planet but also charted its advancing course.

Various biblical passages—especially in Isaiah, Amos, and Job—relate the movement of the celestial Lord to various constellations. 

"Alone he stretches out the heavens and treads upon the highest Deep. He arrives at the Great Bear, Orion and Sirius, and the constellations of the south." 

Or, 

"He smiles his face on Taurus and Aries; from Taurus to Sagittarius he shall go." 

These verses describe a planet that not only spans the highest heavens but also comes in from the south and moves in a clockwise direction—just as we have deduced from the Mesopotamian data.

Quite explicitly, the prophet Habakkuk stated: 

{{< q >}}
"The Lord from the south shall come … his glory shall fill the Earth … and Venus shall be as light, its rays of the Lord given."
{{< /q >}}


Among the many Mesopotamian texts that dealt with the subject, one is quite clear:

{{< q >}}
Planet of the god Marduk:
Upon its appearance: Mercury.
{{< /q >}}

Rising 30 degrees of the celestial arc: Jupiter.

When standing in the place of the celestial battle: Nibiru.

As the accompanying schematic chart illustrates, the above texts do not simply call the 12th Planet by different names (as scholars have assumed). 

They deal rather with the movements of the planet and the three crucial points at which its appearance can be observed and charted from Earth. (Fig. 114) 



The first opportunity to observe the 12th Planet as its orbit brings it back to Earth's vicinity, then, was when it aligned with Mercury (point A)—by our calculations, at an angle of 30 degrees to the imaginary celestial axis of Sun–Earth–perigee.

Coming closer to Earth and thus appearing to "rise" farther in Earth's skies (another 30 degrees, to be exact), the planet crossed the orbit of Jupiter at point B. 

Finally, arriving at the place where the celestial battle had taken place, the perigee, or the Place of the Crossing, the planet is Nibiru, point C. Drawing an imaginary axis between Sun, Earth and the perigee of Marduk's orbit, observers on Earth first saw Marduk aligned with Mercury, at a 30° angle (point A).

Progressing another 30°, Marduk crossed the orbital path of Jupiter at point B.

Then, at its apogee (point C) Marduk reached The Crossing: back at the site of the Celestial Battle, it was closest to Earth, and began its orbit back to distant space.

The anticipation of the Day of the Lord in the ancient Mesopotamian and Hebrew writings (which were echoed in the New Testament's expectations of the coming of the Kingship of Heaven) was thus based on the actual experiences of Earth's people: their witnessing the periodic return of the Planet of Kingship to Earth's vicinity.

The planet's periodic appearance and disappearance from Earth's view confirms the assumption of its permanence in solar orbit. In this it acts like many comets. 

Some of the known comets-like Halley's comet, which nears Earth every seventyfive years—disappeared from view for such long times that astronomers were hardpressed to realize that they were seeing the same comet.

Other comets have been seen only once in human memory, and are assumed to have orbital periods running into thousands of years. 

The comet Kohoutek, for example, first discovered in March 1973, came within 75,000,000 miles of Earth in January 1974, and disappeared behind the Sun soon thereafter. Astronomers calculate it will reappear anywhere from 7,500 to 75,000 years in the future.

Human familiarity with the 12th Planet's periodic appearances and disappearances from view suggests that its orbital period is shorter than that calculated for Kohoutek. If so, why are our astronomers not aware of the existence of this planet?

The fact is that even an orbit half as long as the lower figure for Kohoutek would take the 12th Planet about six times farther away from us than Pluto—a distance at which such a planet would not be visible from Earth, since it would barely (if at all) reflect the Sun's light toward Earth. 

The known planets beyond Saturn were first discovered not visually but mathematically. The orbits of known planets, astronomers found, were apparently being affected by other celestial bodies.

This may also be the way in which astronomers will "discover" the 12th Planet. 

There has already been speculation that a "Planet X" exists, which, though unseen, may be "sensed" through its effects on the orbits of certain comets. 

In 1972, Joseph L. Brady of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory of the University of California discovered that discrepancies in the orbit of Halley's comet could be caused by a planet the size of Jupiter orbiting the Sun every 1,800 years. 

At its estimated distance of 6,000,000,000 miles, its presence could be detected only
mathematically.

While such an orbital period cannot be ruled out, the Mesopotamian and biblical sources present strong evidence that the orbital period of the 12th Planet is 3,600 years. The number 3,600 was written in Sumerian as a large circle. 

The epithet for the planet—shar ("supreme ruler")—also meant "a perfect circle," a "completed cycle." It also meant the number 3,600. And the identity of the three terms—planet/orbit/3,600—could not be a mere coincidence.

Berossus, the Babylonian priest-astronomer-scholar, spoke of ten rulers who reigned upon Earth before the Deluge. Summarizing the writings of Berossus, Alexander Polyhistor wrote: "In the second book was the history of the ten kings of the Chaldeans, and the periods of each reign, which consisted collectively of an hundred and twenty shar's, or four hundred and thirty-two thousand years;
reaching to the time of the Deluge."

Abydenus, a disciple of Aristotle, also quoted Berossus in terms of ten preDiluvial mlers whose total reign numbered 120 shar's. He made clear that these rulers and their cities were located in ancient Mesopotamia: 

The first king of the land was Alarus… He reigned ten shar's.

Now, a shar is esteemed to be three thousand six hundred years…
After him Alaprus reigned three shar's; to him succeeded Amillarus from the
city of panti-Biblon, who reigned thirteen shar's....

After him Ammenon reigned twelve shar's; he was of the city of panti-Biblon.

Then Megalurus of the same place, eighteen shar's.

Then Daos, the Shepherd, governed for the space of ten shar's…

There were afterwards other Rulers, and the last of all Sisithrus; so that in
the whole, the number amounted to ten kings, and the term of their reigns to an
hundred and twenty shar's.

Apollodorus of Athens also reported on the prehistorical disclosures of Berossus in similar terms: Ten rulers reigned a total of 120 shar's (432,000 years), and the reign of each one of them was also measured in the 3,600-year shar units. 

With the advent of Sumerology, the "olden texts" to which Berossus referred were found and deciphered; these were Sumerian king lists, which apparently laid down the tradition of ten pre-Diluvial rulers who ruled Earth from the time when "Kingship was lowered from Heaven" until the "Deluge swept over the Earth."

One Sumerian king list, known as text W-B/144, records the divine reigns in five settled places or "cities." In the first city, Eridu, there were two rulers. The text prefixes both names with the title-syllable "A," meaning "progenitor."


{{< q >}}
When kingship was lowered from Heaven,
kingship was first in Eridu.
In Eridu,
A.LU.LIM became king; he ruled 28,800 years.
A.LAL.GAR ruled 36,000 years.
Two kings ruled it 64,800 years.
{{< /q >}}


Kingship then transferred to other seats of government, where the rulers were
called en, or "lord" (and in one instance by the divine title dingir).


{{< q >}}
I drop Eridu;
its kingship was carried to Bad-Tibira.
In Bad-Tibira,
EN.MEN.LU.AN.NA ruled 43,200 years;
EN.MEN.GAL.AN.NA ruled 28,800 years.
Divine DU.MU.ZI, Shepherd, ruled 36,000 years.
Three kings ruled it for 108,000 years.
{{< /q >}}

The list then names the cities that followed, Larak and Sippar, and their divine
rulers; and last, the city of Shuruppak, where a human of divine parentage was
king. The striking fact about the fantastic lengths of these rules is that, without
exception, they are multiples of 3,600:

{{< q >}}
 Alulim– 8 X 3,600 = 28,800
Alalgar– 10 X 3,600 = 36,000
Enmenluanna– 12 X 3,600 = 43,200
Enmengalanna– 8 X 3,600 = 28,800
Dumuzi– 10 X 3,600 = 36,000
Ensipazianna– 8 X 3,600 = 28,800
Enmenduranna– 6 X 3,600 = 21,600
Ubartutu– 5 X 3,600 = 18,000
{{< /q >}}

Another Sumerian text (W-B/62) added Larsa and its two divine rulers to the king list, and the reign periods it gives are also perfect multiples of the 3,600-year shar. 

With the aid of other texts, the conclusion is that there were 10 rulers in Sumer before the Deluge; each rule lasted so many shar's; and altogether
their reign lasted 120 shar's—as reported by Berossus.

The conclusion that suggests itself is that these shar's of rulership were related
to the orbital period shar (3,600 years) of the planet "Shar," the "Planet of
Kingship"; that Alulim reigned during eight orbits of the 12th Planet, Alalgar
during ten orbits, and so on.
