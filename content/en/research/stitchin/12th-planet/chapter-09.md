The Nefilim's own planet, with its vast orbit, has served as a traveling observatory.

It took them through the orbits of all the outer planets and enabling them to observe at first hand most of the solar system.

When they landed on Earth, a good deal of the knowledge they brought with them concerned astronomy and celestial mathematics. 

The Nefilim, "Gods of Heaven" upon Earth, taught Man to look up unto the heavens—just as Yahweh urged Abraham to do.

The earliest and crudest sculptures and drawings bore
celestial symbols of constellations and planets; and that when the gods were to be
represented or invoked, their celestial symbols were used as a graphic shorthand.

By invoking the celestial ("divine") symbols, Man was no longer alone; the symbols
connected Earthlings with the Nefilim, Earth with Heaven, Mankind with the
universe.

Some of the symbols, we believe, also convey information that could be related
only to space travel to Earth.

There are many ancient texts and lists dealing with the celestial bodies and their associations with the various deities.

The ancient habit of assigning several epithet names to both the celestial bodies and the deities has made identification difficult. 

Even in the case of established identifications, such as Venus/lshtar, the picture is confused by the changes in the pantheon. 

Thus, in earlier times Venus was associated with Ninhursag.

Somewhat greater clarity has been obtained by scholars, such as E. D. Van Buren (Symbols of the Gods in Mesopotamian Art), who assembled and sorted out the more than 80 symbols—of gods and celestial bodies—that can be found on cylinder seals, sculptures, stelae, reliefs, murals, and (in great detail and clarity) on boundary stones (kudurru in Akkadian). 

When the classification of the symbols is made, it becomes evident that apart from standing for some of the better-known southern or northern constellations (such as the Sea Serpent for the constellation Hydra), they represented either the twelve constellations of the zodiac (for example, the Crab for Scorpio), or the 12 Gods of Heaven and Earth, or the 12 members of the solar system.

The kudurru was set up by Melishipak, king of Susa. It shows:
- the 12 symbols of the zodiac
- the symbols of the 12 astral gods.

The Assyrian king Esarhaddon erected a stela which shows the ruler holding the Cup of Life while facing the 12 chief Gods of Heaven and Earth.

It has 4 gods atop animals, of whom Ishtar on the lion and Adad holding the forked lightning can definitely be identified.

Four other gods are represented by the tools of their special attributes, as the war-god Ninurta by his lion-headed mace. 

The remaining 4 gods are shown as celestial bodies:
- the Sun (Shamash)
- the Winged Globe (the 12th Planet, the abode of Anu)
- the Moon's crescent
- a symbol of 7 dots. (Fig. 116)

In later times, the god Sin was associated with the Moon identified by the crescent. 

But in "olden times" the crescent was the symbol of an elderly and bearded deity Ea, one of Sumer's true "olden gods."

The crescent was also associated with the science of measuring and calculating, of which Ea was the divine master.

It was appropriate that the God of the Seas and Oceans, Ea, be assigned as his celestial counterpart the Moon, which causes the ocean's tides.

### The meaning of the 7 dots

These were the celestial symbol of Enlil. 

The depiction of the Gateway of Anu (the Winged Globe) flanked by Ea and Enlil (see Fig. 87), represents them by the crescent and the seven-dot symbol.

Some of the clearest depictions of the celestial symbols that were meticulously copied by Sir Henry Rawlinson (The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia) assign the most prominent position to a group of three symbols, standing for Anu flanked by his two sons; these show that the symbol for Enlil could be either the seven dots or a seven-pointed "star."

The essential element in Enlil's celestial representation was the number seven (the daughter, Ninhursag, was sometimes included, represented by the umbilical cutter). (Fig. 117)

Scholars have been unable to understand a statement by Gudea, king of Lagash, that "the celestial 7 is 50." Attempts at arithmetic solutions—some formula whereby the number seven would go into fifty—failed to reveal the meaning of the statement. However, we see a simple answer: Gudea stated that the celestial body that is "seven" stands for the god that is "fifty." The god Enlil,
whose rank number was fifty, had as his celestial counterpart the planet that was
seventh.

Which planet was the planet of Enlil? We recall the texts that speak of the early times when the gods first came to Earth, when Anu stayed on the 12th Planet, and his two sons who had gone down to Earth drew lots. 

Ea was given the "rulership over the Deep," and to Enlil "the Earth was given for his dominion." And the answer to the puzzle bursts out in all its significance:
The planet of Enlil was Earth. Earth—to the Nefilim—was the seventh planet.

In February 1971, the United States launched an unmanned spacecraft on the longest mission to date. For twenty-one months it traveled, past Mars and the asteroid belt, to a precisely scheduled rendezvous with Jupiter. 

Then, as anticipated by NASA scientists, the immense gravitational pull of Jupiter "grabbed" the spacecraft and hurled it into outer space.
 
Speculating that PIONEER 10 might someday be attracted by the gravitational pull of another "solar system" and crash-land on some planet elsewhere in the universe, the PIONEER 10 scientists attached to it an engraved aluminum plaque bearing the accompanying "message." (Fig. 118)


The message employs a pictographic language—signs and symbols not too different from those used in the very first pictographic writing of Sumer. It attempts to tell whoever might find the plaque that Mankind is male and female, of a size related to the size and shape of the spacecraft. It depicts the two basic chemical elements of our world, and our location relative to a certain interstellar source of radio emissions. And it depicts our solar system as a Sun and nine planets, telling the finder: "The craft that you have found comes from the third planet of this Sun."

Our astronomy is geared to the notion that Earth is the third planet—which, indeed, it is if one begins the count from the center of our system, the Sun. 

But to someone nearing our solar system from the outside, the first planet to be
encountered would be Pluto, the second Neptune, the third Uranus—not Earth.
Fourth would be Saturn; fifth, Jupiter; sixth, Mars.
And Earth would be seventh.


Only the Nefilim, traveling to Earth past Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, could have considered Earth "the seventh." 
 
Even if, for the sake of argument, one assumed that the inhabitants of ancient Mesopotamia, rather than travelers from space, had the knowledge or wisdom to count Earth's position not from the central Sun but from the solar system's edge, then it would follow that the ancient peoples knew of the existence of Pluto and Neptune and Uranus.

Since they could not have known of these outermost planets on their own, the information must, we conclude, have been imparted to them by the Nefilim.

Whichever assumption is adopted as a starting point, the conclusion is the same: Only the Nefilim could have known that there are planets beyond Saturn, as a consequence of which Earth—counting from the outside—is the seventh.

Earth is not the only planet whose numerical position in the solar system was represented symbolically. Ample evidence shows that Venus was depicted as an eight-pointed star: Venus is the eighth planet, following Earth, when counted from the outside. The eight-pointed star also stood for the goddess Ishtar, whose planet was Venus. (Fig. 119)

Many cylinder seals and other graphic relics depict Mars as the sixth planet. A cylinder seal shows the god associated with Mars (originally Nergal, then Nabu), seated on a throne under a six-pointed "star" as his symbol. (Fig. 120) 

Other symbols on the seal show the Sun, much in the same manner we would depict it today; the Moon; and the cross, symbol of the "Planet of Crossing," the 12th Planet.


In Assyrian times, the "celestial count" of a god's planet was often indicated by the appropriate number of star symbols placed alongside the god's throne. Thus, a plaque depicting the god Ninurta placed four star symbols at his throne. His planet Saturn is indeed the fourth planet, as counted by the Nefilim. Similar depictions have been found for most of the other planets.
