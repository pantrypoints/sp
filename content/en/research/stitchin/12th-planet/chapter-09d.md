In the earliest form of pictographic writing, the sign SHU.GI also meant shibu ("the seventh"). 

The astronomical texts explained:


{{< q >}}
Shar shadi il Enlil ana kakkab SHU.GI ikabbi
[Lord of Mountains, deity Enlil, with planet Shugi is identical.]
{{< /q >}}

Paralleling the 7 stations of Marduk's journey, the planets' names also bespeak a space flight. The land at the journey's end was the seventh planet, Earth.


We may never know whether, countless years from now, someone on another
planet will find and understand the message drawn on the plaque attached to
PIONEER 10. Likewise, one would think it futile to expect to find on Earth such a
plaque in reverse—a plaque conveying to Earthlings information regarding the
location and the route from the 12th Planet.
Yet such extraordinary evidence does exist.

The evidence is a clay tablet found in the ruins of the Royal Library of Nineveh.

Like many of the other tablets, it is undoubtedly an Assyrian copy of an earlier
Sumerian tablet. Unlike others, it is a circular disc; and though some cuneiform
signs on it are excellently preserved, the few scholars who took on the task of
deciphering the tablet ended by calling it "the most puzzling Mesopotamian
document."

In 1912, L.W. King, then curator of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities in the British Museum, made a meticulous copy of the disc, which is divided into 8 segments. 

The undamaged portions bear geometric shapes unseen on any other ancient artifact, designed and drawn with considerable precision. They include arrows, triangles, intersecting lines, and even an ellipse—a geometricmathematical curve previously assumed to have been unknown in ancient times.

The unusual and puzzling clay plaque was first brought to the attention of the
scientific community in a report submitted to the British Royal Astronomical
Society on January 9, 1880. R. H. M. Bosanquet and A. H. Sayce, in one of the
earliest discourses on The Babylonian Astronomy, referred to it as a planisphere
(the reproduction of a spherical surface as a flat map). 

They announced that some of the cuneiform signs on it "suggest measurements … appear to bear some technical meaning."

The many names of celestial bodies appearing in the eight segments of the plaque clearly established its astronomical character. Bosanquet and Sayce were especially intrigued by the seven "dots" in one segment. They said these might represent the phases of the Moon, were it not for the fact that the dots appeared to run along a line naming the "star of stars" DIL.GAN and a celestial body called APIN.

<!-- "This enigmatical figure is susceptible of a simple
explanation," they said. But their own effort to provide such an explanation did
not go beyond reading correctly the phonetic values of the cuneiform signs and the
conclusion that the disc was a celestial planisphere. -->

When the Royal Astronomical Society published a sketch of the planisphere, J.
Oppert and P. Jensen improved the reading of some star or planet names. Dr.
Fritz Hommel, writing in a German magazine in 1891 (Die Astronomie der Alten
Chaldäer), drew attention to the fact that each one of the eight segments of the
planisphere formed an angle of 45 degrees, from which he concluded that a total
sweep of the skies—all 360 degrees of the heavens—was represented. 

He suggested that the focal point marked some location "in the Babylonian skies."
There the matter rested until Ernst F. Weidner, first in an article published in
1912 (Babyloniaca: "Zur Babylonischen Astronomie") and then in his major
textbook Handbuch der Babylonischen Astronomie (1915), thoroughly analyzed the
tablet, only to conclude that it did not make sense.

His bafflement was caused by the fact that while the geometric shapes and the
names of stars or planets written within the various segments were legible or
intelligible (even if their meaning or purpose was unclear), the inscriptions along
the lines (running at 45-degree angles to each other) just did not make sense.
They were, invariably, a series of repeated syllables in the tablet's Assyrian
language. They ran, for example, thus:


lu bur di lu bur di lu bur di
bat bat bat kash kash kash kash alu alu alu alu


Weidner concluded that the plaque was both astronomical and astrological,
used as a magical tablet for exorcism, like several other texts consisting of
repeated syllables. With this, he laid to rest any further interest in the unique
tablet.

But the tablet's inscriptions assume a completely different aspect if we try to
read them not as Assyrian word-signs, but as Sumerian word-syllables; for there
can hardly be any doubt that the tablet represents an Assyrian copy of an earlier
Sumerian original. When we look at one of the segments (which we can number I),
its meaningless syllables

na na na na a na a na nu (along the descending line)
sha sha sha sha sha sha (along the circumference)
sham sham bur kur Kur (along the horizontal line)

literally spring to meaningfulness if we enter the Sumerian meaning of these
word-syllables. (Fig. 123)

Route Map -->

What unfolds here is a route map, marking the way by which the god Enlil "went
by the planets," accompanied by some operating instructions. The line inclined at
45 degrees appears to indicate the line of a spaceship's descent from a point which
is "high high high high," through "vapor clouds" and a lower zone that is vaporless,
toward the horizon point, where the skies and the ground meet.

In the skies near the horizontal line, the instructions to the astronauts make
sense: They are told to "set set set" their instruments for the final approach; then,
as they near the ground, "rockets rockets" are fired to slow the craft, which
apparently should be raised ("piled up") before reaching the landing point because
it has to pass over high or rugged terrain ("mountain mountain").

The information provided in this segment clearly pertains to a space voyage by
Enlil himself. In this first segment we are given a precise geometric sketch of two
triangles connected by a line that turns at an angle. 

The line represents a route,
for the inscription clearly states that the sketch shows how the "deity Enlil went
by the planets."

The starting point is the triangle on the left, representing the farther reaches of
the solar system; the target area is on the right, where all the segments converge
toward the landing point.

The triangle on the left, drawn with its base open, is akin to a known sign in
Near Eastern pictographic writing; its meaning can be read as "the ruler's domain,
the mountainous land." The triangle on the right is identified by the inscription
shu-ut il Enlil ("Way of god Enlil"); the term, as we know, denotes Earth's northern
skies.

The angled line, then, connects what we believe to have been the 12th
Planet—"the ruler's domain, the mountainous land"—with Earth's skies. The route
passes between two celestial bodies—Dilgan and Apin.

Some scholars have maintained that these were names of distant stars or parts of constellations. If modern manned and unmanned spacecraft navigate by obtaining a "fix" on predetermined bright stars, a similar navigational technique for the Nefilim cannot be ruled out. Yet the notion that the two names stand for such faraway stars somehow does not agree with the meaning of their names: DIL.CAN meant, literally, "the first station"; and APIN, "where the right course is set."

The meanings of the names indicate way stations, points passed by. We tend to
agree with such authorities as Thompson, Epping, and Strassmaier, who identified
Apin as the planet Mars. If so, the meaning of the sketch becomes clear: The route
between the Planet of Kingship and the skies above Earth passed between Jupiter
("the first station") and Mars ("where the right course is set").
