<!-- Man's lingering belief that there was some Golden Age in his prehistory cannot possibly be based on human recollection, for the event took place too long ago and Man was too primitive to record any concrete information for future generations. 

If Mankind somehow retains a subconscious sense that in those earliest days Man lived through an era of tranquillity and felicity, it is simply because Man knew no better. It is also because the tales of that era were first told Mankind, not by earlier men, but by the Nefilim themselves.  -->

The biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is the only complete account of the events that befell Man following his transportation to the Abode of the Gods in Mesopotamia:


{{< q >}}
The Deity Yahweh planted an orchard In Eden, in the east. He placed there the Adam whom He had created. The Deity Yahweh caused to grow from the ground very tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for eating. The Tree of Life was in the orchard -- the Tree of Knowing good and evil…

The Deity Yahweh took the Adam and placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to keep it:
"Eat from every tree of the orchard, except for the Tree of Knowing good and evil. For you will surely die if you eat it."
{{< /q >}}

<!-- Though two vital fruits were available, the Earthlings were prohibited from reaching only for the fruit of the Tree of Knowing. The Deity—at that point—appeared unconcerned that Man might try to reach for the Fruit of Life. 

Yet Man could not adhere even to that single prohibition, and tragedy followed.

The idyllic picture soon gave way to dramatic developments, which biblical scholars and theologians call the Fall of Man. It is a tale of unheeded divine commandments, divine lies, a wily (but truth-telling) Serpent, punishment, and exile. -->

Appearing from nowhere, the Serpent challenged God's solemn warnings: 

<!-- it is of the fruit of the tree in the
midst of the orchard that the Deity hath said: 'Ye shall not eat of it, neither touch it,
lest ye die.' "-->
{{< q >}}
The Serpent … said unto the woman: "Had the Deity indeed said 'Ye shall not eat of any tree of the orchard'?" The woman relied: "We can eat the fruits of the trees of the orchard, but not the fruit from the tree at the middle of the orchard. If we eat it or touch it, we will die. 

The Serpent said unto the woman: "Nay, ye will surely not die; The Deity does not know that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and ye will be as the Deity— knowing good and evil."

The woman saw that the tree was good to eat and that it was lustful to behold; The tree was desirable to make one wise; She took its fruit and ate it, and gave it also to her mate, and he ate.

The eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves loincloths.
{{< /q >}}


What was the whole confrontation was about? 

<!-- Prohibited under threat of death from even touching the Fruit of Knowing, the two Earthlings were persuaded to go ahead and eat the stuff, which would make them "knowing" as the Deity. Yet all that happened was a sudden awareness that they were naked.

The state of nakedness was indeed a major aspect of the whole incident. 

The biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden opens with the statement:

"And the both of them were naked, the Adam and his mate, and they were not ashamed." 

They were at some lesser stage of human development than that of fully developed humans: Not only were they naked, they were unaware of the implications of such nakedness.

Further examination of the biblical tale suggests that its theme is Man's acquisition of some sexual prowess.

The "knowing" that was held back from Man was not some scientific information but something connected with the male and female sex; for no sooner had Man and his mate acquired the "knowing" than "they
knew that they were naked" and covered their sex organs. -->

The continuing biblical narrative confirms the connection between nakedness and the lack of knowing, for it took the Deity no time at all to put the two together:

{{< q >}}
They heard the sound of the Deity Yahweh walking in the orchard in the day's breeze. The Adam and his mate hid from the Deity Yahweh amongst the orchard's trees. 

The Deity Yahweh called to the Adam: "Where are you?"

He answered: "I heard you in the orchard and I was afraid, for I am naked. So I hid."

He said: "Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat?"
{{< /q >}}


Admitting the truth, the Primitive Worker blamed his female mate, who, in turn, blamed the Serpent.

Greatly angered, the Deity put curses on the Serpent and the two Earthlings.

{{< q >}}
The Deity Yahweh said: "Behold, the Adam has become as one of us, to know good and evil.
And now might he not put forth his hand And partake also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever?"

The Deity Yahweh expelled the Adam from the orchard of Eden.
{{< /q >}}


Then—surprisingly—"the Deity Yahweh made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them."

The whole incident expelled the Earthlings from the Garden of Eden. It was not a dramatic way to explain how Man came to wear clothes.


<!-- The wearing of clothes was merely an outward manifestation of the new "knowing." The acquisition of such "knowing," and the Deity's attempts to deprive Man of it, are the central themes of the events.

No Mesopotamian counterpart of the biblical tale has been found. But the tale—like all the biblical material concerning Creation and Man's prehistory—was of Sumerian origin. 

We have the locale: the Abode of the Gods in Mesopotamia. 

We have the telltale play on words in Eve's name ("she of life," "she of rib"). And we have two vital trees, the Tree of Knowing and the Tree of Life, as in Anu's abode.

Even the words of the Deity reflect a Sumerian origin, for the sole Hebrew Deity has again lapsed into the plural, addressing divine colleagues who were featured not in the Bible but in Sumerian texts: -->


Early Sumerian depictions show that there had been a time when Man, as a Primitive Worker, served his gods stark naked. He was naked whether he served the gods their food and drink, or toiled in the fields or on construction jobs. (Figs. 154, 155)

{{< n n="We interpret the event very differently. The Tree of Life represented the a genetic manipulation to allow the development of the upper chakras, starting with the navel chakra which is above and superior to the sex chakra. In yogic science, the development of the navel chakra leads to the sense of shame or Lajjá [shyness, shame] and trśńá [yearning for acquisition]. Animals and savages have undeveloped upper chakras and so are ok with being naked. We will discard Stitchin's hypothesis on sex with animals." >}}



<!-- The clear implication is that the status of Man vis-à.-vis the gods was not much different from that of domesticated animals. The gods had merely upgraded an existing animal to suit their needs. Did the lack of "knowing," then, mean that, naked as an animal, the newly fashioned being also engaged in sex as, or with, the animals? 

Some early depictions indicate that this was indeed the case. (Fig. 156)

Illustration:
Sexual Intercourse with Animals

Sumerian texts like the "Epic of Gilgamesh" suggest that the manner of sexual intercourse did indeed account for a distinction between wild-Man and human-Man.

When the people of Uruk wanted to civilize the wild Enkidu—"the barbarous fellow from the depths of the steppes"—they enlisted the services of a "pleasure girl" and sent her to meet Enkidu at the water hole where he used to befriend various animals, and there to offer him her "ripeness."

The turning point in the process of "civilizing" Enkidu was the rejection of him by the animals he had befriended. It was important, the people of Uruk told the girl, that she continue to treat him to "a woman's task" until "his wild beasts, that grew up on his steppe, will reject him."

For Enkidu to be torn away from sodomy was a prerequisite to his becoming human.


The lass freed her beasts, bared her bosom,
and he possessed her ripeness…
She treated him, the savage,
to a woman's task.
Apparently the ploy worked. After six days and seven nights, "after he had had
his fill of her charms," he remembered his former playmates.
He set his face toward his wild beasts; but
On seeing him the gazelles ran off.
The wild beasts of the steppe
drew away from his body.


The statement is explicit. The human intercourse brought about such a profound change in Enkidu that the animals he had befriended "drew away from his body."

They did not simply run away; they shunned physical contact with him. Astounded, Enkidu stood motionless for a while, "for his wild animals had gone." But the change was not to be regretted, as the ancient text explains:


He had vision, broader understanding…
The harlot says to him, to Enkidu:
"Thou art knowing, Enkidu;
Thou art become like a god!"


The words in this Mesopotamian text are almost identical to those of the biblical tale of Adam and Eve. As the Serpent had predicted, by partaking of the Tree of Knowing, they had become—in sexual matters—"as the Deity—knowing good and evil."

If this meant only that Man had come to recognize that having sex with animals was uncivilized or evil, why were Adam and Eve punished for giving up sodomy?

The Old Testament is replete with admonitions against sodomy, and it is inconceivable that the learning of a virtue would cause divine wrath. 

The "knowing" that Man obtained against the wishes of the Deity—or one of the deities—must have been of a more profound nature. It was something good for Man, but something his creators did not wish him to have.

We have to read carefully between the lines of the curse against Eve to grasp the meaning of the event:


To the woman He said: "I will greatly multiply thy suffering by thy pregnancy.
In suffering shalt thou bear children, yet to thy mate shall be thy desire"…
And the Adam named his wife "Eve," for she was the mother of all who lived.



This is the momentous event transmitted to us in the biblical tale: As long as Adam and Eve lacked "knowing," they lived in the Garden of Eden without any offspring. Having obtained "knowing," Eve gained the ability (and pain) to become pregnant and bear children. 

Only after the couple had acquired this "knowing," "Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain." 

Throughout the Old Testament, the term "to know" is used to denote sexual intercourse, mostly between a man and his spouse for the purpose of having children.

The tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is the story of a crucial step in Man's development: the acquisition of the ability to procreate.

That the first representatives of Homo sapiens were incapable of reproduction should not be surprising. Whatever method the Nefilim had used to infuse some of their genetic material into the biological makeup of the hominids they selected for the purpose, the new being was a hybrid, a cross between two different, if related, species.

Like a mule (a cross between a mare and a donkey), such mammal hybrids are sterile. Through artificial insemination and even more sophisticated methods of biological engineering, we can produce as many mules as we desire, even without actual intercourse between donkey and mare; but no mule can
procreate and bring forth another mule. -->
