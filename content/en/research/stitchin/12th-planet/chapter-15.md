The Deluge was also traumatic for the Nefilim "gods".

The Sumerian king says that an effort of 120 shar's was wiped away overnight.

The following all lay buried under water and mud:
- the south African mines
- the cities in Mesopotamia
- the control center at Nippur
- the spaceport at Sippar

Hovering in their shuttlecraft above devastated Earth, the Nefilim impatiently awaited the abatement of the waters so that they could set foot again on solid ground.

They were clearly relieved to discover that Man and beast alike had not perished completely.

Even Enlil, at first enraged to discover that his aims had been partly frustrated, soon changed his mind.

The deity's decision was a practical one. 

Faced with their own dire conditions, the Nefilim cast aside their inhibitions about Man, rolled up their sleeves, and imparted to Man the arts of growing crops and cattle.

This is because survival depended on the speed with which agriculture and animal domestication could be developed to sustain the Nefilim and a rapidly multiplying Mankind.
 <!-- the Nefilim applied their advanced scientific knowledge to the task. -->


<!-- Unaware of the information that could be culled from the biblical and Sumerian texts, many scientists who have studied the origins of agriculture have arrived at the conclusion that its "discovery" by Mankind some 13,000 years ago was related to the neothermal ("newly warm") climate that followed the end of the last ice age. Long before modern scholars, however, the Bible also related the beginnings of agriculture to the aftermath of the Deluge.

"Sowing and Harvesting" were described in Genesis as divine gifts granted to Noah and his offspring as part of the post-Diluvial covenant between the Deity and Mankind:
For as long as the Earth's days shall be,
There shall not cease
Sowing and Harvesting,
Cold and Warmth,
Summer and Winter,
Day and Night.

Having been granted the knowledge of agriculture, "Noah as a Husbandman was
first, and he planted a vineyard": He became the first post-Diluvial farmer engaged
in the deliberate, complicated task of planting.
The Sumerian texts, too, ascribed to the gods the granting to Mankind of both
agriculture and the domestication of animals. -->

Tracing the beginnings of agriculture, modern scholars have found that it appeared first in the Near East, but not in the fertile and easily cultivated plains and valleys.

Rather, agriculture began in the mountains skirting the low-lying plains in a semicircle. 

Why would farmers avoid the plains and limit their sowing and reaping to the more difficult mountainous terrain?

The only plausible answer is that the low-lying lands were back then uninhabitable.

13,000 years ago the low-lying areas were not yet dry enough following the Deluge. Millennia passed before the plains and valleys had dried sufficiently to permit the people to come down from the mountains surrounding Mesopotamia and to settle the low-lying plains. 

This is what the Book of Genesis tells us: Many generations after the Deluge, people arriving "from the East"—from the mountainous areas east of Mesopotamia—"found a plain in the land of Shin'ar [Sumer], and settled there."

The Sumerian texts state that Enlil first spread cereals "in the hill country"—in the mountains, not in the plains—and that he made cultivation possible in the mountains by keeping the floodwaters away. "He barred the mountains as with a door." 

The name of this mountainous land east of Sumer, E.LAM, meant "house where vegetation germinated." Later, two of Enlil's helpers, the gods Ninazu and Ninmada, extended the cultivation of cereals to the low-lying plains so that, eventually, "Sumer, the land that knew not grain, came to know grain."

Scholars, who have now established that agriculture began with the domestication of wild emmer as a source of wheat and barley, are unable to explain how the earliest grains (like those found at the Shanidar cave) were already uniform and highly specialized. 

Thousands of generations of genetic selection are needed by nature to acquire even a modest degree of sophistication. 

Yet the period, time, or location in which such a gradual and very prolonged process might have taken place on Earth are nowhere to be found. There is no explanation for this botanogenetic miracle, unless the process was not one of natural selection but of artificial manipulation.

Spelt, a hard-grained type of wheat, poses an even greater mystery. It is the product of "an unusual mixture of botanic genes," neither a development from one genetic source nor a mutation of one source. 

It is definitely the result of mixing the genes of several plants. The whole notion that Man, in a few thousand years, changed animals through domestication, is also questionable.

Modern scholars have no answers to these puzzles, nor to the general question of why the mountainous semicircle in the ancient Near East became a continuous source of new varieties of cereals, plants, trees, fruits, vegetables, and domesticated animals.

The seeds were a gift sent to Earth by Anu from his Celestial Abode. Wheat, barley, and hemp were lowered to Earth from Nibiru.

Agriculture and the domestication of animals were gifts given to Mankind by Enlil and Enki, respectively.


The 3 crucial phases of Man's postDiluvial civilization took place at intervals of 3,600 years:
- agriculture at 11,000 BC
- the Neolithic culture 7500 BC
- the sudden civilization of 3800 BC

These included:
- the presence of the Nefilim 
- the periodic arrivals of Nibiru in Earth's vicinity

The Nefilim passed knowledge to Man in measured doses. They did so in intervals matching the periodic returns of Nibiru to Earth's vicinity.

It was as though some on-site inspection, some face-to-face consultation possible only during the "window" period that allowed landings and takeoffs between Earth and Nibiru, had to take place among the "gods" before another "go ahead" could be given.

The Epic of Etana provides a glimpse of the deliberations that took place. In the days that followed the Deluge, it says:

{{< q >}}
The great Anunnaki who decree the fate sat exchanging their counsels regarding the land.

They who created the four regions, who set up the settlements, who oversaw the land, were too lofty for Mankind.
{{< /q >}}


The Nefilim decided that they needed an intermediary between themselves and the masses of humans. They were to be gods—elu in Akkadian, meaning "lofty ones." 

As a bridge between themselves as lords and Mankind, they introduced "Kingship" on Earth:
appointing a human ruler who would assure Mankind's service to the gods and
channel the teachings and laws of the gods to the people.

A text dealing with the subject describes the situation before either tiara or crown had been placed on a human head, or scepter handed down; all these symbols of Kingship—plus the shepherd's crook, the symbol of righteousness and justice—"lay deposited before Anu in Heaven."
