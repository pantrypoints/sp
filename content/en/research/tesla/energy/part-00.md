### Three Ways Of Increasing Human Energy

<!-- Of all the endless variety of phenomena which nature presents to our senses, there is none that  than that inconceivably complex movement which, in its entirety, we designate as  -->

Human life fills our minds with greatest wonder. 

<!-- Its mysterious origin is veiled in the forever impenetrable mist of the past, its character is rendered incomprehensible by its infinite intricacy, and its destination is hidden in the unfathomable depths of the future.  -->

Where does life come from? What is it? Whither does it tend? 

<!-- Modern science says:
- The sun is the past
- the earth is the present
- the moon is the future.  -->

<!-- From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom.  -->

<!-- 

But do not let us despair. There will still be left upon it a glimmering spark of life, and there will be a chance to kindle a new fire on some distant star. 

This wonderful possibility seems, indeed, to exist, judging from 

Meanwhile the cheering lights of science and art, ever increasing in intensity, illuminate our path, and marvels they disclose, and the enjoyments they offer, make us measurably forgetful of the gloomy future.  -->

Lord Kelvin, in his profound meditations, showed that life will last only around 6 million years, after which the sun's bright light will have ceased to shine along with its life-giving heat.

 <!-- will have ebbed away, and our own earth will be a lump of ice, hurrying on through the eternal night. -->

However, Professor Dewar did beautiful experiments with liquid air. It showed that the germs of organic life are not destroyed by cold, no matter how intense.

It means that they may be transmitted through the interstellar space. 

We might never be able to comprehend human life. But we know certainly that it is a movement. 

<!-- , of whatever nature it be.  -->

The existence of movement unavoidably implies a body which is being moved and a force which is moving it. 

Hence, wherever there is life, there is a mass moved by a force. 


### Every Movement In Nature Must Be Rhythmical


All mass possesses inertia.

All force tends to persist.

Owing to this universal property and condition, a body, be it at rest or in motion, tends to remain in the same state. A force, manifesting itself anywhere and through whatever cause, produces an equivalent opposing force. As an absolute necessity of this, it follows that every movement in nature must be rhythmical. 

Long ago this simple truth was clearly pointed out by Herbert Spencer, who arrived at it through a somewhat different process of reasoning. 

It is borne out in everything we perceive. It is in:
- the movement of a planet
- the surging and ebbing of the tide
- the reverberations of the air
- the swinging of a pendulum
- the oscillations of an electric current
- the infinitely varied phenomena of organic life. 

The whole of human life attests to it. 

Birth, growth, old age, and death of an individual, family, race, or nation are all but a rhythm.

Therefore all life-manifestation is only a movement, even in its most intricate form, as exemplified in man.

To life applies all the same general laws of movement which govern throughout the physical universe.

#### Note to Fig. 1

This result is produced by the discharge of an electrical oscillator giving 12 million volts. 

The electrical pressure alternates at 100,000 times per second. This excites the normally inert nitrogen, causing it to combine with the oxygen. 

The flame-like discharge shown in the photograph measures 65 feet across.
