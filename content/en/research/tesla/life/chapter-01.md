The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention.

It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate
purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the
harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. 

This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he
finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in
the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class
without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter
struggle against pitiless elements. 

Speaking for myself, I have already
had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment; so much,
that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture. I am
credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if
thought is the equivalent of labour, for I have devoted to it almost all of
my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers.

Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never
paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts. In
attempting to give a connected and faithful account of my activities in
this story of my life, I must dwell, however reluctantly, on the
impressions of my youth and the circumstances and events which have
been instrumental in determining my career. Our first endeavors are
purely instinctive prompting of an imagination vivid and undisciplined.
As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more
systematic and designing. But those early impulses, though not
immediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our
very destinies. Indeed, I feel now that had I understood and cultivated
instead of suppressing them, I would have added substantial value to
my bequest to the world.

But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an
inventor. This was due to a number of causes. In the first place I had a
brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree; one of those rare
phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to
explain. His premature death left my earth parents disconsolate. (I will
explain my remark about my "earth parents" later.) We owned a horse
which had been presented to us by a dear friend. It was a magnificent
animal of Arabian breed, possessed of almost human intelligence, and
was cared for and petted by the whole family, having on one occasion
saved my dear father's life under remarkable circumstances.

My father had been called one winter night to perform an urgent duty
and while crossing the mountains, infested by wolves, the horse became
frightened and ran away, throwing him violently to the ground. It
arrived home bleeding and exhausted, but after the alarm was sounded,
immediately dashed off again, returning to the spot, and before the
searching party were far on the way they were met by my father, who
had recovered consciousness and remounted, not realizing that he had
been lying in the snow for several hours. This horse was responsible for
my brother's injuries from which he died. I witnessed the tragic scene
and although so many years have elapsed since, my visual impression of
it has lost none of its force. The recollection of his attainments made
every effort of mine seem dull in comparison. Anything I did that was
creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I
grew up with little confidence in myself.

But I was far from being considered a stupid boy, if I am to judge from
an incident of which I have still a strong remembrance. One day the
Aldermen were passing through a street where I was playing with other
boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen, a wealthy citizen,
paused to give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me, he suddenly
stopped and commanded, "Look in my eyes." I met his gaze, my hand
outstretched to receive the much valued coin, when to my dismay, he
said, "No, not much; you can get nothing from me. You are too smart."

They used to tell a funny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkled faces, one of them having two teeth protruding like the tusks of an elephant, which she buried in my cheek every time she kissed me.
Nothing would scare me more then the prospects of being by these
affectionate, unattractive relatives. It happened that while being carried
in my mother's arms, they asked who was the prettier of the two. After
examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully, pointing to one
of them, "This here is not as ugly as the other."

Then again, I was intended from my very birth, for the clerical
profession and this thought constantly oppressed me. I longed to be an
engineer, but my father was inflexible. He was the son of an officer who
served in the army of the Great Napoleon and in common with his
brother, professor of mathematics in a prominent institution, had
received a military education; but, singularly enough, later embraced the
clergy in which vocation he achieved eminence. He was a very erudite
man, a veritable natural philosopher, poet and writer and his sermons
were said to be as eloquent as those of Abraham a-Sancta-Clara. He had
a prodigious memory and frequently recited at length from works in
several languages. He often remarked playfully that if some of the
classics were lost he could restore them. His style of writing was much
admired. He penned sentences short and terse and full of wit and satire.
The humorous remarks he made were always peculiar and characteristic.
Just to illustrate, I may mention one or two instances. Among the help,
there was a cross-eyed man called Mane, employed to do work around
the farm. He was chopping wood one day. As he swung the axe, my
father, who stood nearby and felt very uncomfortable, cautioned him,
"For God's sake, Mane, do not strike at what you are looking but at what
you intend to hit."

On another occasion he was taking out for a drive, a friend who
carelessly permitted his costly fur coat to rub on the carriage wheel. My
father reminded him of it saying, "Pull in your coat; you are ruining my
tire." He had the odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on
an animated conversation and indulge in heated argument, changing the
tone of his voice. A casual listener might have sworn that several people
were in the room. Although I must trace to my mother's influence
whatever inventiveness I possess, the training he gave me must have
been helpful. It comprised all sorts of exercises - as, guessing one
another's thoughts, discovering the defects of some form of expression,
repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations. These daily
lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason, and especially
to develop the critical sense, and were undoubtedly very beneficial. My
mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and a
line of inventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous
implements for household, agricultural and other uses. She was a truly
great woman, of rare skill, courage and fortitude, who had braved the
storms of life and passed through many a trying experience. When she
was sixteen, a virulent pestilence swept the country. Her father was
called away to administer the last sacraments to the dying and during
his absence she went alone to the assistance of a neighboring family
who were stricken by the dread disease. She bathed, clothed and laid
out the bodies, decorating them with flowers according to the custom of the country and when her father returned he found everything ready for a Christian burial.

My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have
achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern life and
its multi fold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of
tools and devices and wove the finest designs from thread which was
spun by her. She even planted seeds, raised the plants and separated
the fibbers herself. She worked indefatigably, from break of day till late
at night, and most of the wearing apparel and furnishings of the home
were the product of her hands. When she was past sixty, her fingers
were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash. There was
another and still more important reason for my late awakening. In my
boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of
images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the
sight of real objects and interfered with my thoughts and action. They
were pictures of things and scenes which i had really seen, never of
those imagined. When a word was spoken to me the image of the object
it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I
was quite unable to distinguish weather what I saw was tangible or not.

This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of the students of
psychology or physiology whom i have consulted, could ever explain
satisfactorily these phenomenon. They seem to have been unique
although I was probably predisposed as I know that my brother
experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated is that the
images were the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retina
under great excitation. They certainly were not hallucinations such as
are produced in diseased and anguished minds, for in other respects i
was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress, suppose that
I had witnessed a funeral or some such nerve-wracking spectacle. The,
inevitably, in the stillness of night, a vivid picture of the scene would
thrust itself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to banish
it. If my explanation is correct, it should be possible to project on a
screen the image of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such
an advance would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that
this wonder can and will be accomplished in time to come. I may add
that I have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem.
I have managed to reflect such a picture, which i have seen in my mind,
to the mind of another person, in another room. To free myself of these
tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mind on something
else I had seen, and in this way I would often obtain temporary relief;
but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images. It was
not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my
command; my 'reel' had run out as it were, because I had seen little of
the world -- only objects in my home and the immediate surroundings.
As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time, in
order to chase the appearances from my vision, the remedy gradually
lost all its force. Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions
beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge, and I
saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and
would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them.

They gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the
concreteness of real things. I soon discovered that my best comfort was
attained if I simply went on in my vision further and further, getting new
impressions all the time, and so I began to travel; of course, in my mind.
Every night, (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start
on my journeys -- see new places, cities and countries; live there, meet
people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however
unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in
actual life, and not a bit less intense in their manifestations. This I did
constantly until I was about seventeen, when my thoughts turned
seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that i could
visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or
experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have
been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of
materializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radially opposite to
the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much more
expeditious and efficient.

The moment one constructs a device to carry into practice a crude idea,
he finds himself unavoidably engrossed with the details of the
apparatus. As he goes on improving and reconstructing, his force of
concentration diminishes and he loses sight of the great underlying
principle. Results may be obtained, but always at the sacrifice of quality.
My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an
idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the
construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It
is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or
test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no
difference whatever; the results are the same. In this way I am able to
rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything.
When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible
improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into
concrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works
as I conceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I
planned it. In twenty years there has not been a single exception. Why
should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is
positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be examined
beforehand, from the available theoretical and practical data. The
carrying out into practice of a crude idea as is being generally done, is, I
hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money, and time.

My early affliction had however, another compensation. The incessant
mental exertion developed my powers of observation and enabled me to
discover a truth of great importance. I had noted that the appearance of
images was always preceded by actual vision of scenes under peculiar
and generally very exceptional conditions, and I was impelled on each
occasion to locate the original impulse. After a while this effort grew to
be almost automatic and I gained great facility in connecting cause and
effect. 

Soon I became aware, to my surprise, that every thought I
conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not only this but all
my actions were prompted in a similar way. In the course of time it
became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an automation endowed with power of movement responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly. The practical result of this
was the art of tele automatics which has been so far carried out only in
an imperfect manner. Its latent possibilities will, however be eventually
shown. I have been years planning self-controlled automata and believe
that mechanisms can be produced which will act as if possessed of
reason, to a limited degree, and will create a revolution in many
commercial and industrial departments. I was about twelve years of age
when I first succeeded in banishing an image from my vision by willful
effort, but I never had any control over the flashes of light to which I
have referred. They were, perhaps, my strangest and [most]
inexplicable experience. They usually occurred when I found myself in a
dangerous or distressing situations or when i was greatly exhilarated. In
some instances i have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of
living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time
and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about twenty-five years
old.

While in Paris in 1883, a prominent French manufacturer sent me an
invitation to a shooting expedition which I accepted. I had been long
confined to the factory and the fresh air had a wonderfully invigorating
effect on me. On my return to the city that night, I felt a positive
sensation that my brain had caught fire. I was a light as though a small
sun was located in it and I passed the whole night applying cold
compressions to my tortured head. Finally the flashes diminished in
frequency and force but it took more than three weeks before they
wholly subsided. When a second invitation was extended to me, my
answer was an emphatic NO!

These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time,
as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no
longer exciting, being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes
I invariably observe first, a background of very dark and uniform blue,
not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds this
field becomes animated with innumerable scintillating flakes of green,
arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then there
appears, to the right, a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and
closely spaced lines, at right angles to one another, in all sorts of colors
with yellow, green, and gold predominating. Immediately thereafter, the
lines grow brighter and the whole is thickly sprinkled with dots of
twinkling light. This picture moves slowly across the field of vision and
in about ten seconds vanishes on the left, leaving behind a ground of
rather unpleasant and inert grey until the second phase is reached.
Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flit before
my view. When I see them I know I am about to lose consciousness. If
they are absent and refuse to come, it means a sleepless night. To what
an extent imagination played in my early life, I may illustrate by another
odd experience.

Like most children, I was fond of jumping and developed an intense
desire to support myself in the air. Occasionally a strong wind richly
charged with oxygen blew from the mountains, rendering my body light as cork and then I would leap and float in space for a long time. 

It was a delightful sensation and my disappointment was keen when later I
undeceived myself. During that period I contracted many strange likes,
dislikes and habits, some of which I can trace to external impressions
while others are unaccountable. I had a violent aversion against the
earing of women, but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or
less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit,
but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp
edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people
except, perhaps at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking
at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it
caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to
some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in
a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my
mouth. I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical
contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food, otherwise my
meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts or operations I performed had
to be divisible by three and if I missed I felt impelled to do it all over
again, even if it took hours. Up to the age of eight years, my character
was weak and vacillating. I had neither courage or strength to form a
firm resolve. My feelings came in waves and surges and variated
unceasingly between extremes. My wishes were of consuming force and
like the heads of the hydra, they multiplied. I was oppressed by
thoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed by
superstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, of
ghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark. Then all at
once, there came a tremendous change which altered the course of my
whole existence.
Of all things I liked books best. My father had a large library and
whenever I could manage I tried to satisfy my passion for reading. He
did not permit it and would fly in a rage when he caught me in the act.
He hid the candles when he found that I was reading in secret. He did
not want me to spoil my eyes. But I obtained tallow, made the wicking
and cast the sticks into tin forms, and every night I would bush the
keyhole and the cracks and read, often till dawn, when all others slept
and my mother started on her arduous daily tasks . On one occasion I
came across a novel entitled 'Aoafi,' (the son of Aba), a Serbian
translation of a well known Hungarian writer, Josika. This work
somehow awakened my dormant powers of will and I began to practice
self-control. At first my resolutions faded like snow in April, but in a little
while I conquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before
-- that of doing as I willed.

In the course of time this vigorous mental exercise became second to
nature. At the outset my wishes had to be subdued but gradually desire
and will grew to be identical. After years of such discipline I gained so
complete a mastery over myself that I toyed with passions which have
meant destruction to some of the strongest men. At a certain age I
contracted a mania for gambling which greatly worried my parents. To
sit down to a game of cards was for me the quintessence of pleasure. My
father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of
My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla
Pg. 7my time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve, but my
philosophy was bad. I would say to him, 'I can stop whenever I please,
but it it worth while to give up that which I would purchase with the
joys of paradise?' On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and
contempt, but my mother was different. She understood the character of
men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about through
his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lost all my
money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills
and said, 'Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess, the
better it will be. I know that you will get over it.' She was right. I
conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not
been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from
my heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I
have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.
During another period I smoked excessively, threatening to ruin my
health. Then my will asserted itself and I not only stopped but destroyed
all inclination. Long ago I suffered from heart trouble until I discovered
that it was due to the innocent cup of coffee I consumed every morning.
I discontinued at once, though I confess it was not an easy task. In this
way I checked and bridled other habits and passions, and have not only
preserved my life but derived an immense amount of satisfaction from
what most men would consider privation and sacrifice. After finishing
the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University, I had a complete
nervous breakdown and while the malady lasted I observed many
phenomena, strange and unbelievable...
