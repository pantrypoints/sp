<!-- I shall dwell briefly on these extraordinary experiences, on account of their possible interest to students of psychology and physiology and also because this period of agony was of the greatest consequence on my mental development and subsequent labors. 

But it is indispensable to 
first relate the circumstances and conditions which preceded them and
in which might be found their partial explanation.  -->

From childhood I was compelled to concentrate attention upon myself. This caused me much suffering, which I think now was a blessing in disguise.

For it has taught me to appreciate the inestimable value of introspection in the preservation of life, as well as a means of achievement. 

The pressure of occupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into our consciousness through all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardous in many ways. 

**Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves.** 

The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause. 

Even among those who exercise care, it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary, and ignore the real dangers.

What is true of an individual also applies, more or less, to a people as a whole.

Abstinence was not always to my liking, but I find ample reward in the agreeable experiences I am now making. Just in the hope of converting some to my precepts and convictions I will recall one or two. 

A short time ago I was returning to my hotel. It was a bitter cold night, the ground slippery, and no taxi to be had. 

Half a block behind me followed another man, evidently as anxious as myself to get under cover.


Suddenly my legs went up in the air. 

At the same instant there was a flash in my brain. The nerves responded, the muscles contracted. I swung 180 degrees and landed on my hands. I resumed my walk as though nothing had happened when the stranger caught up with me.

[surveying me critically] How old are you?

{{< l a="Nikola Tesla" >}}
Oh, about 59. What of it?

Well, I have seen a cat do this but never a man.

About a month ago I wanted to order new eyeglasses and went to an oculist who put me through the usual tests. He looked at me incredulously as I read off with ease the smallest print at considerable distance. But when I told him I was past sixty he gasped in astonishment. 

Friends of mine often remark that my suits fit me like gloves but they do not know that all my clothing is made to measurements which were taken nearly fifteen years ago and never changed. During this same period my weight has not varied one pound.

In this connection I may tell a funny story.

One evening, in the winter of 1885, Mr. Edison, Edward H. Johnson, the President of the Edison Illuminating Company, Mr. Bachelor, Manager of the works, and myself, entered a little place opposite 65 Firth Avenue, where the offices of the company were located. 

Someone suggested guessing weights and I was induced to step on a scale. 

Edison felt me all over and said: "Tesla weighs 152 lbs. to an ounce," and he guessed it exactly. 

Stripped I weighed 142 pounds, and that is still my weight. 

I whispered to Mr. Johnson; "How is it possible that Edison could guess my weight so closely?" 

"Well," he said, lowering his voice. "I will tell you confidentially, but you must not say anything. He was employed for
a long time in a Chicago slaughterhouse where he weighed thousands of hogs every day. That's why."

My friend, the Hon. Chauncey M. Dupew, tells of an Englishman on whom he sprung one of his original anecdotes and who listened with a puzzled expression, but a year later, laughed out loud. I will frankly confess it took me longer than that to appreciate Johnson's joke. 

My well-being is simply the result of a careful and measured mode of living and perhaps the most astonishing thing is that three times in my youth I was rendered by illness a hopeless physical wreck and given up by physicians. 

MORE than this, through ignorance and lightheartedness, I got into all sorts of difficulties, dangers and scrapes from which I extricated myself as by enchantment. 

I was almost drowned, entombed, lost and frozen. I had hairbreadth escapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals. 

I passed through dreadful diseases and met with all kinds of odd mishaps and that I am whole and hearty today seems like a miracle. 

But as I recall these incidents to my mind I feel convinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental, but was indeed the work of divine power. 

An inventor's endeavor is essentially to save lives.

Whether he harnesses forces, improves devices, or provides new
comforts and conveniences, he is adding to the safety of our existence.
He is also better qualified than the average individual to protect himself
in peril, for he is observant and resourceful. If I had no other evidence
that I was, in a measure, possessed of such qualities, I would find it in
these personal experiences. 

The reader will be able to judge for himself
if I mention one or two instances.

On one occasion, when about fourteen years old, I wanted to scare some friends who were bathing with me. 

My plan was to dive under a long floating structure and slip out quietly at
the other end. Swimming and diving came to me as naturally as to a
duck and I was confident that I could perform the feat. 

Accordingly I plunged into the water and, when out of view, turned around and
proceeded rapidly towards the opposite side. Thinking that I was safely
beyond the structure, I rose to the surface but to my dismay struck a
beam. 

Of course, I quickly dived and forged ahead with rapid strokes
until my breath was beginning to give out. Rising for the second time,
my head came again in contact with a beam. Now I was becoming
desperate. However, summoning all my energy, I made a third frantic
attempt but the result was the same. The torture of suppressed
breathing was getting unendurable, my brain was reeling and I felt
myself sinking.

At that moment, when my situation seemed absolutely
hopeless, I experienced one of those flashes of light and the structure
above me appeared before my vision. 

I either discerned or guessed that there was a little space between the surface of the water and the boards
resting on the beams and, with consciousness nearly gone, I floated up,
pressed my mouth close to the planks and managed to inhale a little air,
unfortunately mingled with a spray of water which nearly choked me.

Several times I repeated this procedure as in a dream until my heart,
which was racing at a terrible rate, quieted down, and I gained
composure. 

After that I made a number of unsuccessful dives, having
completely lost the sense of direction, but finally succeeded in getting
out of the trap when my friends had already given me up and were
fishing for my body. That bathing season was spoiled for me through
recklessness but I soon forgot the lesson and only two years later I fell
into a worse predicament.

There was a large flour mill with a dam across the river near the city
where I was studying at the time. As a rule the height of the water was
only two or three inches above the dam and to swim to it was a sport not
very dangerous in which I often indulged. One day I went alone to the
river to enjoy myself as usual. When I was a short distance from the
masonry, however, I was horrified to observe that the water had risen
and was carrying me along swiftly. I tried to get away but it was too
late. 

Luckily, though, I saved myself from being swept over by taking
hold of the wall with both hands. The pressure against my chest was
great and I was barely able to keep my head above the surface. Not a
soul was in sight and my voice was lost in the roar of the fall. Slowly and
gradually I became exhausted and unable to withstand the strain longer.
Just as I was about to let go, to be dashed against the rocks below, I
saw in a flash of light a familiar diagram illustrating the hydraulic
principle that the pressure of a fluid in motion is proportionate to the
area exposed and automatically I turned on my left side. 

As if by magic, the pressure was reduced and I found it comparatively easy in that
position to resist the force of the stream. But the danger still confronted
me. I knew that sooner or later I would be carried down, as it was not
possible for any help to reach me in time, even if I had attracted
attention. I am ambidextrous now, but then I was left-handed and had
comparatively little strength in my right arm. For this reason I did not
dare to turn on the other side to rest and nothing remained but to slowly
push my body along the dam. I had to get away from the mill towards
which my face was turned, as the current there was much swifter and
deeper. It was a long and painful ordeal and I came near to failing at its
very end, for I was confronted with a depression in the masonry. 

I managed to get over with the last ounce of my strength and fell in a
swoon when I reached the bank, where I was found. I had torn virtually
all the skin from my left side and it took several weeks before the fever
had subsided and I was well. These are only two of many instanced, but
they may be sufficient to show that had it not been for the inventor's
instinct, I would not have lived to tell the tale.

Interested people have often asked me how and when I began to invent.
This I can only answer from my present recollection in the light of
which, the first attempt I recall was rather ambitious for it involved the
invention of an apparatus and a method. In the former I was
anticipated, but the later was original. It happened in this way. One of
my playmates had come into the possession of a hook and fishing tackle
which created quite an excitement in the village, and the next morning
all started out to catch frogs. I was left alone and deserted owing to a
quarrel with this boy. I had never seen a real hook and pictured it as
something wonderful, endowed with peculiar qualities, and was despairing not to be one of the party. Urged by necessity, I somehow got hold of a piece of soft iron wire, hammered the end to a sharp point
between two stones, bent it into shape, and fastened it to a strong
string. 

I then cut a rod, gathered some bait, and went down to the brook
where there were frogs in abundance. But I could not catch any and was
almost discouraged when it occurred to me dangle the empty hook in
front of a frog sitting on a stump. At first he collapsed but by and by his
eyes bulged out and became bloodshot, he swelled to twice his normal
size and made a vicious snap at the hook. Immediately I pulled him up. I
tried the same thing again and again and the method proved infallible.
When my comrades, who in spite of their fine outfit had caught nothing,
came to me, they were green with envy. For a long time I kept my secret
and enjoyed the monopoly but finally yielded to the spirit of Christmas.
Every boy could then do the same and the following summer brought
disaster to the frogs.

In my next attempt, I seem to have acted under the first instinctive
impulse which later dominated me, -- to harness the energies of nature
to the service of man. I did this through the medium of May bugs, or
June bugs as they are called in America, which were a veritable pest in
that country and sometimes broke the branches of trees by the sheer
weight of their bodies. The bushes were black with them. 

I would attach
as many as four of them to a crosspiece, rotably arranged on a thin
spindle, and transmit the motion of the same to a large disc and so
derive considerable 'power.' These creatures were remarkably efficient,
for once they were started, they had no sense to stop and continued
whirling for hours and hours and the hotter it was, the harder they
worked. All went well until a strange boy came to the place. He was the
son of a retired officer in the Austrian army. That urchin ate Maybugs
alive and enjoyed them as though they were the finest blue-point
oysters. That disgusting sight terminated my endeavors in this
promising field and I have never since been able to touch a Maybug or
any other insect for that matter.

After that, I believe, I undertook to take apart and assemble the clocks
of my grandfather. In the former operation I was always successful, but
often failed in the latter. So it came that he brought my work to a
sudden halt in a manner not too delicate and it took thirty years before I
tackled another clockwork again.

Shortly thereafter, I went into the manufacture of a kind of popgun
which comprised a hollow tube, a piston, and two plugs of hemp. When
firing the gun, the piston was pressed against the stomach and the tube
was pushed back quickly with both hands. The air between the plugs
was compressed and raised to a high temperature and one of them was
expelled with a loud report. The art consisted in selecting a tube of the
proper taper from the hollow stalks which were found in our garden. I
did very well with that gun, but my activities interfered with the window
panes in our house and met with painful discouragement.

If I remember rightly, I then took to carving swords from pieces of
furniture which I could conveniently obtain. At that time I was under the
sway of the Serbian national poetry and full of admiration for the feats
of the heroes. I used to spend hours in mowing down my enemies in the
form of cornstalks which ruined the crops and netted me several
spankings from my mother. Moreover, these were not of the formal kind
but the genuine article. I had all this and more behind me before I was
six years old and had passed through one year of elementary school in
the village of Smiljan where my family lived. At this juncture we moved
to the little city of Gospic nearby. 

This change of residence was like a
calamity to me. It almost broke my heart to part from our pigeons,
chickens and sheep, and our magnificent flock of geese which used to
rise to the clouds in the morning and return from the feeding grounds at
sundown in battle formation, so perfect that it would have put a
squadron of the best aviators of the present day to shame. In our new
house I was but a prisoner, watching the strange people I saw through
my window blinds. My bashfulness was such that I would rather have
faced a roaring lion than one of the city dudes who strolled about. But
my hardest trial came on Sunday when I had to dress up and attend the
service. There I met with an accident, the mere thought of which made
my blood curdle like sour milk for years afterwards. It was my second
adventure in a church. Not long before, I was entombed for a night in an
old chapel on an inaccessible mountain which was visited only once a
year. It was an awful experience, but this one was worse.

There was a wealthy lady in town, a good but pompous woman, who
used to come to the church gorgeously painted up and attired with an
enormous train and attendants. One Sunday I had just finished ringing
the bell in the belfry and rushed downstairs, when this grand dame was
sweeping out and I jumped on her train. It tore off with a ripping noise
which sounded like a salvo of musketry fired by raw recruits. My father
was livid with rage. He gave me a gentle slap on the cheek, the only
corporal punishment he ever administered to me, but I almost feel it
now. The embarrassment and confusion that followed are indescribably.
I was practically ostracized until something else happened which
redeemed me in the estimation of the community.

An enterprising young merchant had organized a fire department. A new fire engine was purchased, uniforms provided and the men drilled for service and parade. The engine was beautifully painted red and black.

One afternoon, the official trial was prepared for and the machine was
transported to the river. The entire population turned out to witness the
great spectacle. When all the speeches and ceremonies were concluded,
the command was given to pump, but not a drop of water came from the
nozzle. The professors and experts tried in vain to locate the trouble.
The fizzle was complete when I arrived at the scene. My knowledge of
the mechanism was nil and I knew next to nothing of air pressure, but
instinctively I felt for the suction hose in the water and found that it had
collapsed. 

When I waded in the river and opened it up, the water rushed
forth and not a few Sunday clothes were spoiled. Archimedes running
naked through the streets of Syracuse and shouting Eureka at the top of
his voice did not make a greater impression than myself. I was carried
on the shoulders and was hero of the day.

Upon settling in the city I began a four years course in the so-called
Normal School preparatory to my studies at the College or Real-
Gymnasium. During this period my boyish efforts and exploits as well as
troubles, continued. Among other things, I attained the unique
distinction of champion crow catcher in the country. My method of
procedure was extremely simple. I would go into the forest, hide in the
bushes, and imitate the call of the birds. Usually I would get several
answers and in a short while a crow would flutter down into the
shrubbery near me. After that, all I needed to do was to throw a piece of
cardboard to detract its attention, jump up and grab it before it could
extricate itself from the undergrowth. In this way I would capture as
many as I desired. But on one occasion something occurred which made
me respect them. I had caught a fine pair of birds and was returning
home with a friend. When we left the forest, thousands of crows had
gathered making a frightful racket. In a few minutes they rose in pursuit
and soon enveloped us. The fun lasted until all of a sudden I received a
blow on the back of my head which knocked me down. 

Then they
attacked me viciously. I was compelled to release the two birds and was
glad to join my friend who had taken refuge in a cave.
In the school room there were a few mechanical models which
interested me and turned my attention to water turbines. I constructed
many of these and found great pleasure in operating them. How
extraordinary was my life an incident may illustrate. My uncle had no
use for this kind of pastime and more than once rebuked me. I was
fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused, and pictured
in my imagination a big wheel run by the falls. I told my uncle that I
would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I was
my ideas carried out at Niagara and marveled at the unfathomable
mystery of the mind. I made all kinds of other contrivances and
contraptions but among those, the arbalests I produced were the best.
My arrows, when short, disappeared from sight and at close range
traversed a plank of pine one inch thick. Through the continuous
tightening of the bows I developed a skin on my stomach much like that
of a crocodile and I am often wondering whether it is due to this exercise that I am able even now to digest cobblestones! 

Nor can I pass in silence my performances with the sling which would have enabled me
to give a stunning exhibit at the Hippodrome. And now I will tell of one
of my feats with this unique implement of war which will strain to the
utmost the credulity of the reader.

I was practicing while walking with my uncle along the river. The sun
was setting, the trout were playful and from time to time one would
shoot up into the air, its glistening body sharply defined against a
projecting rock beyond. Of course any boy might have hit a fish under
these propitious conditions but I undertook a much more difficult task
and I foretold to my uncle, to the minutest detail, what I intended doing.
I was to hurl a stone to meet the fish, press its body against the rock,
and cut it in two. It was no sooner said than done. My uncle looked at
me almost scared out of his wits and exclaimed "Vade retra Satanae!"
and it was a few days before he spoke to me again. Other records,
however great, will be eclipsed but I feel that I could peacefully rest on
my laurels for a thousand years.
