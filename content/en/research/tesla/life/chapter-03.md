The Rotary Magnetic Field

At the age of ten I entered the Real gymnasium which was a new and
fairly well equipped institution. In the department of physics were
various models of classical scientific apparatus, electrical and
mechanical. The demonstrations and experiments performed from time
to time by the instructors fascinated me and were undoubtedly a
powerful incentive to invention. 

I was also passionately fond of
mathematical studies and often won the professor's praise for rapid
calculation. This was due to my acquired facility of visualizing the
figures and performing the operation, not in the usual intuitive manner,
but as in actual life. 

Up to a certain degree of complexity it was
absolutely the same to me whether I wrote the symbols on the board or
conjured them before my mental vision. But freehand drawing, to which
many hours of the course were devoted, was an annoyance I could not
endure. This was rather remarkable as most of the members of the
family excelled in it. Perhaps my aversion was simply due to the
predilection I found in undisturbed thought. Had it not been for a few
exceptionally stupid boys, who could not do anything at all, my record
would have been the worst.

It was a serious handicap as under the then existing educational regime
drawing being obligatory, this deficiency threatened to spoil my whole
career and my father had considerable trouble in railroading me from
one class to another. In the second year at that institution I became
obsessed with the idea of producing continuous motion through steady
air pressure. The pump incident, of which I have been told, had set afire
my youthful imagination and impressed me with the boundless
possibilities of a vacuum. I grew frantic in my desire to harness this
inexhaustible energy but for a long time I was groping in the dark.
Finally, however, my endeavors crystallized in an invention which was to
enable me to achieve what no other mortal ever attempted. Imagine a
cylinder freely rotatable on two bearings and partly surrounded by a
rectangular trough which fits it perfectly. 

The open side of the trough is
enclosed by a partition so that the cylindrical segment within the enclosure divides the latter into two compartments entirely separated
from each other by airtight sliding joints. One of these compartments
being sealed and once for all exhausted, the other remaining open, a
perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result. At least, so I thought.
A wooden model was constructed and fitted with infinite care and when
I applied the pump on one side and actual observed that there was a
tendency to turning, I was delirious with joy. Mechanical flight was the
one thing I wanted to accomplish although still under the discouraging
recollection of a bad fall I sustained by jumping with an umbrella from
the top of a building. Every day I used to transport myself through the
air to distant regions but could not understand just how I managed to do
it. 

Now I had something concrete, a flying machine with nothing more
than a rotating shaft, flapping wings, and; - a vacuum of unlimited
power! From that time on I made my daily aerial excursions in a vehicle
of comfort and luxury as might have befitted King Solomon. It took
years before I understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at right
angles to the surface of the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort I
observed was due to a leak! Though this knowledge came gradually it
gave me a painful shock. 

I had hardly completed my course at the Real
Gymnasium when I was prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a
score of them, and my condition became so desperate that I was given
up by physicians. During this period I was permitted to read constantly,
obtaining books from the Public Library which had been neglected and
entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation of
catalogues.

One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I
had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget me
hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them
might have been due the miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-
five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship
between us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that
great man of laughter burst into tears... My studies were continued at
the higher Real Gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia, where one of my aunts
resided. She was a distinguished lady, the wife of a Colonel who was an
old war-horse having participated in many battles, I can never forget the
three years I passed at their home. No fortress in time of war was under
a more rigid discipline. I was fed like a canary bird. All the meals were of
the highest quality and deliciously prepared, but short in quantity by a
thousand percent. The slices of ham cut by my aunt were like tissue
paper. When the Colonel would put something substantial on my plate
she would snatch it away and say excitedly to him; "Be careful. Niko is
very delicate." I had a voracious appetite and suffered like Tantalus. But
I lived in an atmosphere of refinement and artistic taste quite unusual
for those times and conditions. The land was low and marshy and
malaria fever never left me while there despite the enormous amounts
of quinine I consumed. Occasionally the river would rise and drive an
army of rats into the buildings, devouring everything, even to the
bundles of fierce paprika. These pests were to me a welcome diversion. I
thinned their ranks by all sorts of means, which won me the unenviable
distinction of rat-catcher in the community. At last, however, my course was completed, the misery ended, and I obtained the certificate of maturity which brought me to the crossroads.

During all those years my parents never wavered in their resolve to
make me embrace the clergy, the mere thought of which filled me with
dread. I had become intensely interested in electricity under the
stimulating influence of my Professor of Physics, who was an ingenious
man and often demonstrated the principles by apparatus of his own
invention. Among these I recall a device in the shape of a freely
rotatable bulb, with tinfoil coating, which was made to spin rapidly when
connected to a static machine. It is impossible for me to convey an
adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I experienced in witnessing his
exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Every impression produced
a thousand echoes in my mind. 

I wanted to know more of this wonderful
force; I longed for experiment and investigation and resigned myself to
the inevitable with aching heart. Just as I was making ready for the long
journey home I received word that my father wished me to go on a
shooting expedition. It was a strange request as he had been always
strenuously opposed to this kind of sport. But a few days later I learned
that the cholera was raging in that district and, taking advantage of an
opportunity, I returned to Gospic in disregard to my parent's wishes. It
is incredible how absolutely ignorant people were as to the causes of
this scourge which visited the country in intervals of fifteen to twenty
years. They thought that the deadly agents were transmitted through
the air and filled it with pungent odors and smoke. In the meantime they
drank infested water and died in heaps. I contracted the dreadful
disease on the very day of my arrival and although surviving the crisis, I
was confined to bed for nine months with scarcely any ability to move.
My energy was completely exhausted and for the second time I found
myself at Death's door.

In one of the sinking spells which was thought to be the last, my father
rushed into the room. I still see his pallid face as he tried to cheer me in
tones belying his assurance. "Perhaps," I said, "I may get well if you will
let me study engineering." "You will go to the best technical institution
in the world," he solemnly replied, and I knew that he meant it. A heavy
weight was lifted from my mind but the relief would have come too late
had it not been for a marvelous cure brought through a bitter decoction
of a peculiar bean. I came to life like Lazarus to the utter amazement of
everybody. My father insisted that I spend a year in healthful physical
outdoor exercise to which I reluctantly consented. For most of this term
I roamed in the mountains, loaded with a hunter's outfit and a bundle of
books, and this contact with nature made me stronger in body as well as
in mind. I thought and planned, and conceived many ideas almost as a
rule delusive. The vision was clear enough but the knowledge of
principles was very limited.

In one of my invention I proposed to convey letters and packages across
the seas, through a submarine tube, in spherical containers of sufficient
strength to resist the hydraulic pressure. The pumping plant, intended to
force the water through the tube, was accurately figured and designed
and all other particulars carefully worked out. Only one trifling detail, of no consequence, was lightly dismissed. I assumed an arbitrary velocity of the water and, what is more, took pleasure in making it high, thus
arriving at a stupendous performance supported by faultless
calculations. Subsequent reflections, however, on the resistance of pipes
to fluid flow induced me to make this invention public property.

Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator
which would, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning
motion by reactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one
thousand miles an hour, impracticable by rail. The reader will smile. The
plan was difficult of execution, I will admit, but not nearly so bad as that
of a well known New York professor, who wanted to pump the air from
the torrid to temperate zones, entirely forgetful of the fact that the Lord
had provided a gigantic machine for this purpose.

Still another scheme, far more important and attractive, was to derive
power from the rotational energy of terrestrial bodies. I had discovered
that objects on the earth's surface owing to the diurnal rotation of the
globe are carried by the same alternately in and against the direction of
translatory movement. From this results a great change in momentum
which could be utilized in the simplest imaginable manner to furnish
motive effort in any habitable region of the world. I cannot find words to
describe my disappointment when later I realized that I was in the
predicament of Archimedes, who vainly sought for a fixed point in the
universe. 

At the termination of my vacation I was sent to the Polytechnic School in Gratz, Styria (Austria), which my father had chosen as one of the oldest and best reputed institutions. That was the moment I
had eagerly awaited and I began my studies under good auspices and
firmly resolved to succeed. My previous training was above average, due
to my father's teaching and opportunities afforded. I had acquired the
knowledge of a number of languages and waded through the books of
several libraries, picking up information more or less useful. Then again,
for the first time, I could choose my subjects as I liked, and free-hand
drawing was to bother me no more.

I had made up my mind to give my parents a surprise, and during the
whole first year I regularly started my work at three o'clock in the
morning and continued until eleven at night, no Sundays or holidays
excepted. As most of my fellow-students took things easily, naturally I
eclipsed all records. In the course of the year I passed through nine
exams and the professors thought I deserved more than the highest
qualifications. Armed with their flattering certificate, I went home for a
short rest, expecting triumph, and was mortified when my father made
light of these hard-won honors. 

That almost killed my ambition; but
later, after he had died, I was pained to find a package of letters which
the professors had written to him to the effect that unless he took me
away from the Institution I would be killed through overwork.
Thereafter I devoted myself chiefly to physics, mechanics and
mathematical studies, spending the hours of leisure in the libraries. I
had a veritable mania for finishing whatever I began, which often got
me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of
Voltaire, when I learned, to my dismay that there were close to one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written
while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be
done, but when I laid aside that last book I was very glad, and said,
"Never more!"
My first year's showing had won me the appreciation and friendship of

several professors. Among these, Professor Rogner, who was teaching
arithmetical subjects and geometry; Professor Poeschl, who held the
chair of theoretical and experimental physics, and Dr. Alle, who taught
integral calculus and specialized in differential equations. This scientist
was the most brilliant lecturer to whom I ever listened. He took a special
interest in my progress and would frequently remain for an hour or two
in the lecture room, giving me problems to solve, in which I delighted.
To him I explained a flying machine I had conceived, not an illusory
invention, but one based on sound, scientific principles, which has
become realizable through my turbine and will soon be given to the
world. Both Professors Rogner and Poeschl were curious men. The
former had peculiar ways of expressing himself and whenever he did so,
there was a riot, followed by a long embarrassing pause. 

Professor Poeschl was a methodical and thoroughly grounded German. He had
enormous feet, and hands like the paws of a bear, but all of his
experiments were skillfully performed with clock-like precision and
without a miss. It was in the second year of my studies that we received
a Gramoe Dyname from Paris, having the horseshoe form of a laminated
field magnet, and a wire wound armature with a commutator. It was
connected up and various effects of the currents were shown. While
Professor Poeschl was making demonstrations, running the machine was
a motor, the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it
might be possible to operate a motor without these appliances. But he
declared that it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a
lecture on the subject, at the conclusion he remarked, Mr. Tesla may
accomplish great things, but he certainly will never do this. It would be
equivalent to converting a steadily pulling force, like that of gravity into
a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea. But
instinct is something which transcends knowledge. 

We have,
undoubtedly, certain finer fibbers that enable us to perceive truths when
logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile.
For a time I wavered, impressed by the professor's authority, but soon
became convinced I was right and undertook the task with all the fire
and boundless confidence of my youth. I started by first picturing in my
mind a direct-current machine, running it and following the changing
flow of the currents in the armature. Then I would imagine an alternator
and investigate the progresses taking place in a similar manner. Next I
would visualize systems comprising motors and generators and operate
them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real and
tangible. All my remaining term in Gratz was passed in intense but
fruitless efforts of this kind, and I almost came to the conclusion that
the problem was insolvable. In 1880 I went to Prague, Bohemia,
carrying out my father's wish to complete my education at the University
there. 

It was in that city that I made a decided advance, which consisted
in detaching the commutator from the machine and studying the phenomena in this new aspect, but still without result. In the year following there was a sudden change in my views of life.
I realized that my parents had been making too great sacrifices on my
account and resolved to relieve them of the burden. The wave of the
American telephone had just reached the European continent and the
system was to be installed in Budapest, Hungary. It appeared an ideal
opportunity, all the more as a friend of our family was at the head of the
enterprise. It was here that I suffered the complete breakdown of the
nerves to which I have referred. What I experienced during the period of
the illness surpasses all belief. My sight and hearing were always
extraordinary. 

I could clearly discern objects in the distance when
others saw no trace of them. Several times in my boyhood I saved the
houses of our neighbors from fire by hearing the faint crackling sounds
which did not disturb their sleep, and calling for help. In 1899, when I
was past forty and carrying on my experiments in Colorado, I could hear
very distinctly thunderclaps at a distance of 550 miles. My ear was thus
over thirteen times more sensitive, yet at that time I was, so to speak,
stone deaf in comparison with the acuteness of my hearing while under
the nervous strain.

In Budapest I could hear the ticking of a watch with three rooms
between me and the timepiece. A fly alighting on a table in the room
would cause a dull thud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance of a
few miles fairly shook my whole body. The whistle of a locomotive
twenty or thirty miles away made the bench or chair on which I sat,
vibrate so strongly that the pain was unbearable. The ground under my
feet trembled continuously. I had to support my bed on rubber cushions
to get any rest at all. The roaring noises from near and far often
produced the effect of spoken words which would have frightened me
had I not been able to resolve them into their accumulated components.

The sun rays, when periodically intercepted, would cause blows of such
force on my brain that they would stun me. I had to summon all my will
power to pass under a bridge or other structure, as I experienced the
crushing pressure on the skull. In the dark I had the sense of a bat, and
could detect the presence of an object at a distance of twelve feet by a
peculiar creepy sensation on the forehead. My pulse varied from a few to
two hundred and sixty beats and all the tissues of my body with
twitchings and tremors, which was perhaps hardest to bear. A renowned
physician who have me daily large doses of Bromide of Potassium,
pronounced my malady unique and incurable.

It is my eternal regret that I was not under the observation of experts in
physiology and psychology at that time. I clung desperately to life, but
never expected to recover. Can anyone believe that so hopeless a
physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man of astonishing
strength and tenacity; able to work thirty-eight years almost without a
day's interruption, and find himself still strong and fresh in body and
mind? Such is my case. A powerful desire to live and to continue the
work and the assistance of a devoted friend, an athlete, accomplished
the wonder. 

My health returned and with it the vigor of mind in
attacking the problem again, I almost regretted that the struggle was soon to end. I had so much energy to spare. When I understood the task, it was not with a resolve such as men often make. With me it was a
sacred vow, a question of life and death. I knew that I would perish if I
failed. Now I felt that the battle was won. Back in the deep recesses of
the brain was the solution, but I could net yet give it outward
expression.

One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I was enjoying
a walk with my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. At that age, I
knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe's
"Faust." The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious
passage, "Sie ruckt und weight, der Tag ist uberlebt, Dort eilt sie hin und
fordert neues Leben. Oh, da kein Flugel mich vom Boden hebt Ihr nach
und immer nach zu streben! Ein schsner Traum indessen sie entweicht,
Ach, au des Geistes Flygein wird so leicht Kein korperlicher Flugel sich
gesellen!" As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash
of lightening and in an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a
stick on the sand, the diagram shown six years later in my address
before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and my companion
understood them perfectly. The images I saw were wonderfully sharp
and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, so much so that I told
him, "See my motor here; watch me reverse it." I cannot begin to
describe my emotions. Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life could
not have been more deeply moved. A thousand secrets of nature which I
might have stumbled upon accidentally, I would have given for that one
which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my
existence...
