Chapter 4 The Discovery of the Tesla Coil and Transformer

For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of
picturing machines and devising new forms. It was a mental state of
happiness about as complete as I have ever known in life. 

Ideas came in
an uninterrupted stream and the only difficulty I had was to hold them
fast. The pieces of apparatus I conceived were to me absolutely real and
tangible in every detail, even to the minutest marks and signs of wear. I
delighted in imagining the motors constantly running, for in this way
they presented to the mind's eye a fascinating sight. 

When natural
inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his
goal in seven-league boots. In less than two months I evolved virtually
all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are now
identified with my name, and which are used under many other names
all over the world. It was, perhaps, providential that the necessities of
existence commanded a temporary halt to this consuming activity of the
mind.

I came to Budapest prompted by a premature report concerning the
telephone enterprise and, as irony of fate willed it, I had to accept a
position as draughtsman in the Central Telegraph Office of the
Hungarian government at a salary which I deem it my privilege not to
disclose. Fortunately, I soon won the interest of the inspector-in-chief
and was thereafter employed on calculations, designs and estimates in
connection with new installations, until the telephone exchange started,
when I took charge of the same. The knowledge and practical
experience I gained in the course of this work, was most valuable and
the employment gave me ample opportunities for the exercise of my
inventive faculties. I made several improvements in the central station
apparatus and perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier which was
never patented or publicly described but would be creditable to me even
today. In recognition of my efficient assistance the organizer of the
undertaking, Mr. Puskas, upon disposing of his business in Budapest,
offered me a position in Paris which I gladly accepted.
I never can forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my
mind. For several days after my arrival, I roamed through the streets in
utter bewilderment of the new spectacle. The attractions were many and
irresistible, but, alas, the income was spent as soon as received. 

When
Mr. Puskas asked me how I was getting along in the new sphere, I
described the situation accurately in the statement that "The last
twenty-nine days of the month are the toughest." I led a rather
strenuous life in what would now be termed "Rooseveltian fashion."
Every morning, regardless of the weather, I would go from the
boulevard St-Marcel, where I resided, to a bathing house on the Seine;
plunge into the water, loop the circuit twenty-seven times and then walk
an hour to reach Ivry, where the company's factory was located. 

There I
would have a wood-chopper's breakfast at half-past seven o'clock and
then eagerly await the lunch hour, in the meanwhile cracking hard nuts
for the manager-of-the-works, Mr. Charles Batchellor, who was an
intimate friend and assistant of Edison. Here I was thrown in contact
with a few Americans who fairly fell in love with my because of my
proficiency in Billiards! To these men I explained my invention and one
of them, Mr. D. Cunningham, foreman of the mechanical department,
offered to form a stock company. 

The proposal seemed to me comical in
the extreme. I did not have the faintest conception of what he meant,
except that it was an American way of doing things. Nothing came of it,
however, and during the next few months I had to travel from one place
to another in France and Germany to cure the ills of the power plants.
On my return to Paris, I submitted to one of the administrators of the
company, Mr. Rau, a plan for improving their dynamos and was given an
opportunity. My success was complete and the delighted directors
accorded me the privilege of developing automatic regulators which
were much desired. Shortly after, there was some trouble with the
lighting plant which had been installed at the new railroad station in
Strasbourg, Alsace. The wiring was defective and on the occasion of the
opening ceremonies, a large part of a wall was blown out through a
short-circuit, right in the presence of old Emperor William I. The German
government refused to take the plant and the French company was

Pg. 24facing a serious loss. On account of my knowledge of the German
language and past experience, I was entrusted with the difficult task of
straightening out matters and early in 1883, I went to Strasbourg on
that mission.

Some of the incidents in that city have left an indelible record on my
memory. By a curious coincidence, a number of the men who
subsequently achieved fame, lived there about that time. In later life I
used to say, "There were bacteria of greatness in that old town." Others
caught the disease, but I escaped!" The practical work, correspondence,
and conferences with officials kept me preoccupied day and night, but as
soon as I was able to manage, I undertook the construction of a simple
motor in a mechanical shop opposite the railroad station, having brought
with me from Paris some material for that purpose. The consummation
of the experiment was, however, delayed until the summer of that year,
when I finally had the satisfaction of seeing the rotation effected by
alternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts or
commutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite
pleasure but not to compare with the delirium of joy following the first
revelation.

Among my new friends was the former mayor of the city, Mr. Sauzin,
whom I had already, in a measure, acquainted with this and other
inventions of mine and whose support I endeavored to enlist. He was
sincerely devoted to me and put my project before several wealthy
persons, but to my mortification, found no response. He wanted to help
me in every possible way and the approach of the first of July, 1917,
happens to remind me of a form of "assistance" I received from that
charming man, which was not financial, but none the less appreciated.
In 1870, when the Germans invaded the country, Mr. Sauzin had buried
a good sized allotment of St. Estephe of 1801 and he came to the
conclusion that he knew no worthier person than myself to consume that
precious beverage. This, I may say, is one of the unforgettable incidents
to which I have referred. My friend urged me to return to Paris as soon
as possible and seek support there. This I was anxious to do, but my
work and negotiations were protracted, owing to all sorts of petty
obstacles I encountered, so that at times the situation seemed hopeless.
Just to give an idea of German thoroughness and "efficiency," I may
mention here a rather funny experience.

An incandescent lamp of 16 c.p. was to be placed in a hallway, and upon
selecting the proper location, I ordered the "monteur" to run the wires.
After working for a while, he concluded that the engineer had to be
consulted and this was done. The latter made several objections but
ultimately agreed that the lamp should be placed two inches from the
spot I had assigned, whereupon the work proceeded. Then the engineer
became worried and told me that Inspector Averdeck should be notified.
That important person was called, he investigated, debated, and decided
that the lamp should be shifted back two inches, which was the place I
had marked! It was not long, however, before Averdeck got cold feet
himself and advised me that he had informed Ober-Inspector
Hieronimus of the matter and that I should await his decision. 

It was several days before the ober-inspector was able to free himself of other
pressing duties, but at last he arrived and a two hour debate followed,
when he decided to move the lamp two inches further. My hopes that
this was the final act, were shattered when the ober-inspector returned
and said to me, "Regierungsrath Funke is particular that I would not
dare to give an order for placing this lamp without his explicit approval."
Accordingly, arrangements for a visit from that great man were made.
We started cleaning up and polishing early in the morning, and when
Funke came with his retinue he was ceremoniously received. After two
hours of deliberation, he suddenly exclaimed, "I must be going!," and
pointing to a place on the ceiling, he ordered me to put the lamp there.
It was the exact spot which I had originally chosen! So it went day after
day with variations, but I was determined to achieve, at whatever cost,
and in the end my efforts were rewarded.

By the spring of 1884, all the differences were adjusted, the plant
formally accepted, and I returned to Paris with pleasing anticipation.
One of the administrators had promised me a liberal compensation in
case I succeeded, as well as a fair consideration of the improvements I
had made to their dynamos and I hoped to realize a substantial sum.
There were three administrators, whom I shall designate as A, B, and C
for convenience. When I called on A, he told me what B had the say. This
gentleman thought that only C could decide, and the latter was quite
sure that A alone had the power to act. After several laps of this circulus
viciousus, it dawned upon me that my reward was a castle in Spain.
The utter failure of my attempts to raise capital for development was
another disappointment, and when Mr. Bachelor pressed me to go to
America with a view of redesigning the Edison machines, I determined
to try my fortunes in the Land of Golden Promise. But the chance was
nearly missed. I liquefied my modest assets, secured accommodations
and found myself at the railroad station as the train was pulling out. At
that moment, I discovered that my money and tickets were gone. What
to do was the question. Hercules had plenty of time to deliberate, but I
had to decide while running alongside the train with opposite feeling
surging in my brain like condenser oscillations. Resolve, helped by
dexterity, won out in the nick of time and upon passing through the
usual experience, as trivial and unpleasant, I managed to embark for
New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poems and articles
I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions of an
unsolvable integral and my flying machine. During the voyage I sat most
of the time at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save
somebody from a watery grave, without the slightest thought of danger.

Later, when I had absorbed some of the practical American sense, I
shivered at the recollection and marveled at my former folly. The
meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at
this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific
training, had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages,
delved in literature and art, and had spent my best years in libraries
reading all sorts of stuff that fell into my hands, from Newton's Principia
to the novels of Paul de Kock, and felt that most of my life had been
squandered. But it did not take long before I recognized that it was the best thing I could have done. Within a few weeks I had won Edison's confidence, and it came about in this way.

The S.S. Oregon, the fastest passenger steamer at that time, had both of
its lighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed. As the
superstructure had been built after their installation, it was impossible
to remove them from the hold. The predicament was a serious one and
Edison was much annoyed. In the evening I took the necessary
instruments with me and went aboard the vessel where I stayed for the
night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short-circuits
and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew, I succeeded in putting
them in good shape. At five o'clock in the morning, when passing along
Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Bachelor and a
few others, as they were returning home to retire. "Here is our Parisian
running around at night," he said. When I told him that I was coming
from the Oregon and had repaired both machines, he looked at me in
silence and walked away without another word. But when he had gone
some distance I heard him remark, "Bachelor, this is a good man." And
from that time on I had full freedom in directing the work. For nearly a
year my regular hours were from 10:30 A.M. until 5 o'clock the next
morning without a day's exception. Edison said to me, "I have had many
hard working assistants, but you take the cake." During this period I
designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with short
cores and uniform pattern, which replaced the old ones. The manager
had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task,
but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and
I resigned my position.

Immediately thereafter, some people approached me with the proposal
of forming an arc light company under my name, to which I agreed. Here
finally, was an opportunity to develop the motor, but when I broached
the subject to my new associates they said, "No, we want the arc lamp.
We don't care for this alternating current of yours." In 1886, my system
of arc lighting was perfected and adopted for factory and municipal
lighting, and I was free, but with no other possession than a beautifully
engraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value. Then followed a
period of struggle in the new medium for which I was not fitted, but the
reward came in the end, and in April, 1887, the Tesla Electric Co. was
organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. The motors I built there
were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the
design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my
vision and the operation was always as I expected.
In the early part of 1888, an arrangement was made with the
Westinghouse Company for the manufacture of the motors on a large
scale. But great difficulties had still to be overcome. My system was
based on the use of low frequency currents and the Westinghouse
experts had adopted 133 cycles with the objects of securing advantages
in transformation. They did not want to depart with their standard forms
of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated upon adapting the
motor to these conditions. Another necessity was to produce a motor capable of running efficiently at this frequency on two wires, which was not an easy accomplishment.

At the close of 1889, however, my services in Pittsburgh being no longer
essential, I returned to New York and resumed experimental work in a
Laboratory on Grand Street, where I began immediately the design of
high-frequency machines. The problems of construction in this
unexplored field were novel and quite peculiar, and I encountered many
difficulties. I rejected the inductor type, fearing that it might not yield
perfect sine waves, which were so important to resonant action. Had it
not been for this, I could have saved myself a great deal of labor.
Another discouraging feature of the high-frequency alternator seemed to
be the inconstancy of speed which threatened to impose serious
limitations to its use. I had already noted in my demonstrations before
the American Institution of Electrical Engineers, that several times the
tune was lost, necessitating readjustment, and did not yet foresee what
I discovered long afterwards, a means of operating a machine of this
kind at a speed constant to such a degree as not to vary more than a
small fraction of one revolution between the extremes of load. From
many other considerations, it appeared desirable to invent a simpler
device for the production of electric oscillations.

In 1856, Lord Kelvin had exposed the theory of the condenser discharge,
but no practical application of that important knowledge was made. I
saw the possibilities and undertook the development of induction
apparatus on this principle. My progress was so rapid as to enable me to
exhibit at my lecture in 1891 a coil giving sparks of five inches. On that
occasion I frankly told the engineers of a defect involved in the
transformation by the new method, namely, the loss in the spark gap.
Subsequent investigation showed that no matter what medium is
employed, be it air, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil, or a stream of
electrons, the efficiency is the same. It is a law very much like the
governing of the conversion of mechanical energy. We may drop a
weight from a certain height vertically down, or carry it to the lower
level along any devious path; it is immaterial insofar as the amount of
work is concerned. Fortunately however, this drawback is not fatal, as
by proper proportioning of the resonant, circuits of an efficiency of 85
percent is attainable. Since my early announcement of the invention, it
has come into universal use and wrought a revolution in many
departments, but a still greater future awaits it.

When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 1,000 feet and flashed a
current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I
observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations
akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.
