The Influences That Shape Our Destiny

The influences that shape our destinies are very subtle. 

One winter's day I managed to climb a steep mountain, in company with other boys. The snow was quite deep and a warm
southerly wind made it just suitable for our purpose. 

We amused
ourselves by throwing balls which would roll down a certain distance,
gathering more or less snow, and we tried to outdo one another in this
sport. Suddenly a ball was seen to go beyond the limit, swelling to
enormous proportions until it became as big as a house and plunged
thundering into the valley below with a force that made the ground
tremble. I looked on spellbound incapable of understanding what had
happened. For weeks afterward the picture of the avalanche was before
my eyes and I wondered how anything so small could grow to such an
immense size.

Ever since that time the magnification of feeble actions fascinated me,
and when, years later, I took up the experimental study of mechanical
and electrical resonance, I was keenly interested from the very start.
Possibly, had it not been for that early powerful impression I might not
have followed up the little spark I obtained with my coil and never
developed my best invention, the true history of which I will tell. Many
technical men, very able in their special departments, but dominated by
a pedantic spirit and nearsighted, have asserted that excepting the
induction motor, I have given the world little of practical use. This is a
grievous mistake. A new idea must not be judged by its immediate
results. My alternating system of power transmission came at a
psychological moment, as a long sought answer to pressing industrial
questions, and although considerable resistance had to be overcome and
opposing interests reconciled, as usual, the commercial introduction
could not be long delayed. 

Now, compare this situation with that
confronting my turbines, for example. One should think that so simple and beautiful an invention, possessing many features of an ideal motor, should be adopted at once and, undoubtedly, it would under similar
conditions. But the prospective effect of the rotating field was not to
render worthless existing machinery; on the contrary, it was to give it
additional value. The system lent itself to new enterprise as well as to
improvement of the old. My turbine is an advance of a character entirely
different. It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would
mean the abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on
which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances, the
progress must needs be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is
encountered in the prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts
by organized opposition.

Only the other day, I had a disheartening experience when I met my
friend and former assistant, Charles F. Scott, now professor of Electric
Engineering at Yale. I had not seen him for a long time and was glad to
have an opportunity for a little chat at my office. Our conversation,
naturally enough, drifted on my turbine and I became heated to a high
degree. "Scott," I exclaimed, carried away by the vision of a glorious
future, "My turbine will scrap all the heat engines in the world." Scott
stroked his chin and looked away thoughtfully, as though making a
mental calculation. "That will make quite a pile of scrap," he said, and
left without another word.

These and other inventions of mine, however, were nothing more than
steps forward in a certain directions. In evolving them, I simply followed
the inborn instinct to improve the present devices without any special
thought of our far more imperative necessities. The "Magnifying
Transmitter" was the product of labours extending through years,
having for their chief object, the solution of problems which are
infinitely more important to mankind than mere industrial development.
If my memory serves me right, it was in November, 1890, that I
performed a laboratory experiment which was one of the most
extraordinary and spectacular ever recorded in the annals of Science. In
investigating the behavior of high frequency currents, I had satisfied
myself that an electric field of sufficient intensity could be produced in a
room to light up electrode less vacuum tubes. Accordingly, a transformer
was built to test the theory and the first trial proved a marvelous
success. It is difficult to appreciate what those strange phenomena
meant at the time. We crave for new sensations, but soon become
indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common
occurrences. When my tubes were first publicly exhibited, they were
viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From all parts of the
world, I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and other
flattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined. But in 1892
the demand became irresistible and I went to London where I delivered
a lecture before the institution of Electrical Engineers.

It has been my intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance
with a similar obligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing
before the Royal Institution. 

I was a man of firm resolve, but succumbed easily to the forceful arguments of the great Scotsman. He pushed me into a chair and poured out half a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which
sparkled in all sorts of iridescent colors and tasted like nectar. "Now,"
said he, "you are sitting in Faraday's chair and you are enjoying whiskey
he used to drink." (Which did not interest me very much, as I had
altered my opinion concerning strong drink). The next evening I have a
demonstration before the Royal Institution, at the termination of which,
Lord Rayleigh addressed the audience and his generous words gave me
the first start in these endeavors. I fled from London and later from
Paris, to escape favors showered upon me, and journeyed to my home,
where I passed through a most painful ordeal and illness. Upon
regaining my health, I began to formulate plans for the resumption of
work in America. Up to that time I never realized that I possessed any
particular gift of discovery, but Lord Rayleigh, whom I always
considered as an ideal man of science, had said so and if that was the
case, I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea. At this time, as at
many other times in the past, my thoughts turned towards my Mother's
teaching. The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if
we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this
great power. My Mother had taught me to seek all truth in the Bible;
therefore I devoted the next few months to the study of this work.
One day, as I was roaming the mountains, I sought shelter from an
approaching storm. The sky became overhung with heavy clouds, but
somehow the rain was delayed until, all of a sudden, there was a
lightening flash and a few moments after, a deluge. This observation set
me thinking. It was manifest that the two phenomena were closely
related, as cause and effect, and a little reflection led me to the
conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation of the
water was inconsiderable, the function of the lightening being much like
that of a sensitive trigger. Here was a stupendous possibility of
achievement. If we could produce electric effects of the required quality,
this whole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be
transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans and winds drive it
to distant regions where it remains in a state of most delicate balance. If
it were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired, this might
life sustaining stream could be at will controlled. We could irrigate arid
deserts, create lakes and rivers, and provide motive power in unlimited
amounts. This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun to
the uses of man. The consummation depended on our ability to develop
electric forces of the order of those in nature.
It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made up my mind to try it and
immediately on my return to the United States in the summer of 1892,
after a short visit to my friends in Watford, England; work was begun
which was to me all the more attractive, because a means of the same
kind was necessary for the successful transmission of energy without
wires. At this time I made a further careful study of the Bible, and
discovered the key in Revelation. The first gratifying result was obtained
in the spring of the succeeding year, when I reaching a tension of about
100,000,000 volts—one hundred million volts -- with my conical coil,
which I figured was the voltage of a flash of lightening. Steady progress was made until the destruction of my laboratory by fire, in 1895, as may be judged from an article by T.C. Martin which appeared in the April
number of the Century Magazine. This calamity set me back in many
ways and most of that year had to be devoted to planning and
reconstruction. However, as soon as circumstances permitted, I
returned to the task.

Although I knew that higher electric-motive forces were attainable with
apparatus of larger dimensions, I had an instinctive perception that the
object could be accomplished by the proper design of a comparatively
small and compact transformer. In carrying on tests with a secondary in
the form of flat spiral, as illustrated in my patents, the absence of
streamers surprised me, and it was not long before I discovered that
this was due to the position of the turns and their mutual action.
Profiting from this observation, I resorted to the use of a high tension
conductor with turns of considerable diameter, sufficiently separated to
keep down the distributed capacity, while at the same time preventing
undue accumulation of the charge at any point. The application of this
principle enabled me to produce pressures of over 100,000,000 volts,
which was about the limit obtainable without risk of accident. A
photograph of my transmitter built in my laboratory at Houston Street,
was published in the Electrical Review of November, 1898.

In order to advance further along this line, I had to go into the open, and
in the spring of 1899, having completed preparations for the erection of
a wireless plant, I went to Colorado where I remained for more than one
year. Here I introduced other improvements and refinements which
made it possible to generate currents of any tension that may be
desired. Those who are interested will find some information in regard
to the experiments I conducted there in my article, "The Problem of
Increasing Human Energy," in the Century Magazine of June 1900, to
which I have referred on a previous occasion.

I will be quite explicit on the subject of my magnifying transformer so
that it will be clearly understood. In the first place, it is a resonant
transformer, with a secondary in which the parts, charged to a high
potential, are of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal
enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, and at proper
distances from one another, thereby insuring a small electric surface
density everywhere, so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is
bare. It is suitable for any frequency, from a few to many thousands of
cycles per second, and can be used in the production of currents of
tremendous volume and moderate pressure, or of smaller amperage and
immense electromotive force. The maximum electric tension is merely
dependent on the curvature of the surfaces on which the charged
elements are situated and the area of the latter. Judging from my past
experience there is no limit to the possible voltage developed; any
amount is practicable. On the other hand, currents of many thousands of
amperes may be obtained in the antenna. A plant of but very moderate
dimensions is required for such performances. Theoretically, a terminal
of less than 90 feet in diameter is sufficient to develop an electromotive
force of that magnitude, while for antenna currents of from 2,000-4,000 amperes at the usual frequencies, it need not be larger than 30 feet in
diameter. In a more restricted meaning, this wireless transmitter is one
in which the Hertzwave radiation is an entirely negligible quantity as
compared with the whole energy, under which condition the damping
factor is extremely small and an enormous charge is stored in the
elevated capacity. Such a circuit may then be excited with impulses of
any kind, even of low frequency and it will yield sinusoidal and
continuous oscillations like those of an alternator. Taken in the
narrowest significance of the term, however, it is a resonant transformer
which, besides possessing these qualities, is accurately proportioned to
fit the globe and its electrical constants and properties, by virtue of
which design it becomes highly efficient and effective in the wireless
transmission of energy. Distance is then absolutely eliminated, there
being no diminuation in the intensity of the transmitted impulses. It is
even possible to make the actions increase with the distance from the
plane, according to an exact mathematical law. This invention was one
of a number comprised in my "World System" of wireless transmission
which I undertook to commercialize on my return to New York in 1900.

As to the immediate purposes of my enterprise, they were clearly
outlined in a technical statement of that period from which I quote, "The
world system has resulted from a combination of several original
discoveries made by the inventor in the course of long continued
research and experimentation. It makes possible not only the
instantaneous and precise wireless transmission of any kind of signals,
messages or characters, to all parts of the world, but also the inter-
connection of the existing telegraph, telephone, and other signal
stations without any change in their present equipment. By its means,
for instance, a telephone subscriber here may call up and talk to any
other subscriber on the Earth. An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than a
watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speech
delivered or music played in some other place, however distant."
These examples are cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of
this great scientific advance, which annihilates distance and makes that
perfect natural conductor, the Earth, available for all the innumerable
purposes which human ingenuity has found for a line-wire. One far-
reaching result of this is that any device capable of being operated
through one or more wires (at a distance obviously restricted) can
likewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with the same
facility and accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other than
those imposed by the physical dimensions of the earth. Thus, not only
will entirely new fields for commercial exploitation be opened up by this
ideal method of transmission, but the old ones vastly extended. The
World System is based on the application of the following import and
inventions and discoveries:

1. The Tesla Transformer: This apparatus is in the production of
electrical vibrations as revolutionary as gunpowder was in
warfare. Currents many times stronger than any ever generated in
the usual ways and sparks over one hundred feet long, have been
produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind.

2. The Magnifying Transmitter: This is Tesla's best invention, a
peculiar transformer specially adapted to excite the earth, which is
in the transmission of electrical energy when the telescope is in
astronomical observation. By the use of this marvelous device, he
has already set up electrical movements of greater intensity than
those of lightening and passed a current, sufficient to light more
than two hundred incandescent lamps, around the Earth.

3. The Tesla Wireless System: This system comprises a number of
improvements and is the only means known for transmitting
economically electrical energy to a distance without wires. Careful
tests and measurements in connection with an experimental
station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado, have
demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed,
clear across the Globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few
per cent.

4. The Art of Individualization: This invention of Tesla is to primitive

Tuning, what refined language is to unarticulated expression. It
makes possible the transmission of signals or messages absolutely
secret and exclusive both in the active and passive aspect, that is,
non-interfering as well as non-interferable. Each signal is like an
individual of unmistakable identity and there is virtually no limit to
the number of stations or instruments which can be
simultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance.

5. The Terrestrial Stationary Waves: This wonderful discovery, popularly explained, means that the Earth is responsive to
electrical vibrations of definite pitch, just as a tuning fork to
certain waves of sound. These particular electrical vibrations,
capable of powerfully exciting the Globe, lend themselves to
innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many
other respects. 

The "first World System" power plant can be put in
operation in nine months. With this power plant, it will be
practicable to attain electrical activities up to ten million
horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technical
achievements as are possible without due expense.

Among these are the following:

1. The interconnection of existing telegraph exchanges or offices all over the world

2. The establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraph service

3. The interconnection of all present telephone exchanges or offices around the Globe

4. The universal distribution of general news by telegraph or telephone, in conjunction with the Press

5. The establishment of such a "World System" of intelligence transmission for exclusive private use

6. The interconnection and operation of all stock tickers of the world;

7. The establishment of a World system—of musical distribution, etc.;

8. The universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the hour with astronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever

9. The world transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks, etc.;

10. The establishment of a universal marine service enabling the navigators of all ships to steer perfectly without compass, to
determine the exact location, hour and speak; to prevent collisions
and disasters, etc.;

11. The inauguration of a system of world printing on land and sea;

12. The world reproduction of photographic pictures and all kinds of
drawings or records..."

I also proposed to make demonstration in the wireless transmission of
power on a small scale, but sufficient to carry conviction. Besides these, I referred to other and incomparably more important applications of my discoveries which will be disclosed at some future date. A plant was built
on Long Island with a tower 187 feet high, having a spherical terminal
about 68 feet in diameter. 

These dimensions were adequate for the transmission of virtually any amount of energy. Originally, only from 200
to 300 K.W. were provided, but I intended to employ later several
thousand horsepower. The transmitter was to emit a wave-complex of
special characteristics and I had devised a unique method of telephonic
control of any amount of energy. The tower was destroyed two years
ago (1917) but my projects are being developed and another one,
improved in some features will be constructed.

On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the
structure was demolished by the Government, which owing to war
conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may
not know that the papers, which thirty years ago conferred upon me the
honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my
orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are
packed away in old trunks. 

If this report had a foundation, I would have
been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower. On the contrary, it was in the interest of the Government to preserver it, particularly as it would have made possible,
to mention just one valuable result, the location of a submarine in any
part of the world. My plant, services, and all my improvements have
always been at the disposal of the officials and ever since the outbreak
of the European conflict, I have been working at a sacrifice on several
inventions of mine relating to aerial navigation, ship propulsion and
wireless transmission, which are of the greatest importance to the
country. Those who are well informed know that my ideas have
revolutionized the industries of the United States and I am not aware
that there lives an inventor who has been, in this respect, as fortunate
as myself,—especially as regards the use of his improvements in the
war.

I have refrained from publicly expressing myself on this subject before,
as it seemed improper to dwell on personal matters while all the world
was in dire trouble. I would add further, in view of various rumors which
have reached me, that Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan did not interest himself
with me in a business way, but in the same large spirit in which he has
assisted many other pioneers. 

He carried out his generous promise to the letter and it would have been most unreasonable to expect from him anything more. He had the highest regard for my attainments and gave
me every evidence of his complete faith in my ability to ultimately
achieve what I had set out to do. I am unwilling to accord to some
small-minded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted
my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty
disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not
prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time, but the same laws will
prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.
