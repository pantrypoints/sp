No subject to which I have ever devoted myself has called for such
concentration of mind, and strained to so dangerous a degree the finest
fibbers of my brain, as the systems of which the Magnifying transmitter
is the foundation. I put all the intensity and vigor of youth in the
development of the rotating field discoveries, but those early labours
were of a different character. Although strenuous in the extreme, they
did not involve that keen and exhausting discernment which had to be
exercised in attacking the many problems of the wireless.

Despite my rare physical endurance at that period, the abused nerves
finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse, just as the
consummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight. Without
doubt I would have paid a greater penalty later, and very likely my
career would have been prematurely terminated, had not providence
equipped me with a safety device, which seemed to improve with
advancing years and unfailingly comes to play when my forces are at an
end. So long as it operates I am safe from danger, due to overwork,
which threatens other inventors, and incidentally, I need no vacations
which are indispensable to most people. When I am all but used up, I
simply do as the darkies who "naturally fall asleep while white folks
worry."

To venture a theory out of my sphere, the body probably accumulates
little by little a definite quantity of some toxic agent and I sink into a
nearly lethargic state which lasts half an hour to the minute. Upon
awakening I have the sensation as though the events immediately
preceding had occurred very long ago, and if I attempt to continue the
interrupted train of thought I feel veritable nausea. Involuntarily, I then
turn to other and am surprised at the freshness of the mind and ease
with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled me before. 

After
weeks or months, my passion for the temporarily abandoned invention returns and I invariably find answers to all the vexing questions, with
scarcely any effort. In this connection, I will tell of an extraordinary
experience which may be of interest to students of psychology. I had
produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitter and was
endeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation to the currents
propagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, and
for more than a year I worked unremittingly, but in vain. This profound
study so entirely absorbed me, that I became forgetful of everything
else, even of my undermined health. At last, as I was at the point of
breaking down, nature applied the preservative inducing lethal sleep.
Regaining my senses, I realized with consternation that I was unable to
visualize scenes from my life except those of infancy, the very first ones
that had entered my consciousness. Curiously enough, these appeared
before my vision with startling distinctness and afforded me welcome
relief. Night after night, when retiring, I would think of them and more
and more of my previous existence was revealed. The image of my
mother was always the principal figure in the spectacle that slowly
unfolded, and a consuming desire to see her again gradually took
possession of me. This feeling grew so strong that I resolved to drop all
work and satisfy my longing, but I found it too hard to break away from
the laboratory, and several months elapsed during which I had
succeeded in reviving all the impressions of my past life, up to the spring
of 1892. In the next picture that came out of the mist of oblivion, I saw
myself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris, just coming to from one of my
peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion of
the brain. Imagine the pain and distress I felt, when it flashed upon my
mind that a dispatch was handed to me at that very moment, bearing the
sad news that my mother was dying. I remembered how I made the long
journey home without an hour of rest and how she passed away after
weeks of agony. It was especially remarkable that during all this period
of partially obliterated memory, I was fully alive to everything touching
on the subject of my research. I could recall the smallest detail and the
least insignificant observations in my experiments and even recite pages
of text and complex mathematical formulae.

My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The true rewards are ever in
proportion to the labour and sacrifices made. This is one of the reasons
why I feel certain that of all my inventions, the magnifying Transmitter
will prove most important and valuable to future generations. I am
prompted to this prediction, not so much by thoughts of the commercial
and industrial revolution which it will surely bring about, but of the
humanization consequences of the many achievements it makes
possible. Considerations of mere utility weigh little in the balance
against the higher benefits of civilization. We are confronted with
portentous problems which can not be solved just by providing for our
material existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in
this direction is fraught with hazards and perils not less menacing than
those born from want and suffering. If we were to release the energy of
atoms or discover some other way of developing cheap and unlimited
power at any point on the globe, this accomplishment, instead of being a
blessing, might bring disaster to mankind in giving rise to dissension
and anarchy, which would ultimately result in the enthronement of the hated regime of force. The greatest good will come from technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wireless
transmitter is preeminently such. By its means, the human voice and
likeness will be reproduced everywhere and factories driven thousands
of miles from waterfalls furnishing power. 

Aerial machines will be
propelled around the earth without a stop and the sun's energy
controlled to create lakes and rivers for motive purposes and
transformation of arid deserts into fertile land. Its introduction for
telegraphic, telephonic and similar uses, will automatically cut out the
static and all other interferences which at present, impose narrow limits
to the application of the wireless. This is a timely topic on which a few
words might not be amiss.

During the past decade a number of people have arrogantly claimed that
they had succeeded in doing away with this impediment. I have carefully
examined all of the arrangements described and tested most of them
long before they were publicly disclosed, but the finding was uniformly
negative. Recent official statement from the U.S. Navy may, perhaps,
have taught some beguilable news editors how to appraise these
announcements at their real worth. 

As a rule, the attempts are based on
theories so fallacious, that whenever they come to my notice, I can not
help thinking in a light vein. Quite recently a new discovery was
heralded, with a deafening flourish of trumpets, but it proved another
case of a mountain bringing forth a mouse. This reminds me of an
exciting incident which took place a year ago, when I was conducting my
experiments with currents of high frequency.

Steve Brodie had just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. The feat has been
vulgarized since by imitators, but the first report electrified New York. I
was very impressionable then and frequently spoke of the daring printer.
On a hot afternoon I felt the necessity of refreshing myself and stepped
into one of the popular thirty thousand institutions of this great city,
where a delicious twelve per cent beverage was served, which can now
be had only by making a trip to the poor and devastated countries of
Europe. The attendance was large and not over-distinguished and a
matter was discussed which gave me an admirable opening for the
careless remark, "This is what I said when I jumped off the bridge." No
sooner had I uttered these words, than I felt like the companion of
Timothens, in the poem of Schiller. In an instant there was
pandemonium and a dozen voices cried, "It is Brodie!" I threw a quarter
on the counter and bolted for the door, but the crowd was at my heels
with yells, "Stop, Steve!", which must have been misunderstood, for
many persons tried to hold me up as I ran frantically for my haven of
refuge. By darting around corners I fortunately managed, through the
medium of a fire escape, to reach the laboratory, where I threw off my
coat, camouflaged myself as a hardworking blacksmith and started the
forge. But these precautions proved unnecessary, as I had eluded my
pursuers. For many years afterward, at night, when imagination turns
into specters the trifling troubles of the day, I often thought, as I tossed
on the bed, what my fate would have been, had the mob caught me and
found out that I was not Steve Brodie!


Now the engineer who lately gave an account before a technical body of
a novel remedy against static based on a "heretofore unknown law of
nature," seems to have been as reckless as myself when he contended
that these disturbances propagate up and down, while those of a
transmitter proceed along the earth. It would mean that a condenser as
this globe, with its gaseous envelope, could be charged and discharged
in a manner quite contrary to the fundamental teachings propounded in
every elemental textbook of physics. Such a supposition would have
been condemned as erroneous, even in Franklin's time, for the facts
bearing on this were then well known and the identity between
atmospheric electricity and that developed by machines was fully
established. 

Obviously, natural and artificial disturbances propagate
through the earth and the air in exactly the same way, and both set up
electromotive forces in the horizontal, as well as vertical sense.
Interference can not be overcome by any such methods as were
proposed. The truth is this: In the air the potential increases at the rate
of about fifty volts per foot of elevation, owing to which there may be a
difference of pressure amounting to twenty, or even forty thousand volts
between the upper and lower ends of the antenna. The masses of the
charged atmosphere are constantly in motion and give up electricity to
the conductor, not continuously, but rather disruptively, this producing a
grinding noise in a sensitive telephonic receiver. The higher the terminal
and the greater the space encompassed by the wires, the more
pronounced is the effect, but it must be understood that it is purely local
and has little to do with the real trouble.

In 1900, while perfecting my wireless system, one form of apparatus
compressed four antennae. These were carefully calibrated in the same
frequency and connected in multiple with the object of magnifying the
action in receiving from any direction. When I desired to ascertain the
origin of the transmitted impulse, each diagonally situated pair was put
in series with a primary coil energizing the detector circuit. In the
former case, the sound was loud in the telephone; in the latter it ceased,
as expected, the two antennae neutralizing each other, but the true
static manifested themselves in both instances and I had to devise
special preventives embodying different principles. By employing
receivers connected to two points of the ground, as suggested by me
long ago, this trouble caused by the charged air, which is very serious in
the structures as now built, is nullified and besides, the liability of all
kinds of interference is reduced to about one-half because of the
directional character of the circuit. This was perfectly self-evident, but
came as a revelation to some simple-minded wireless folks whose
experience was confined to forms of apparatus that could have been
improved with an axe, and they have been disposing of the bear's skin
before killing him. If it were true that strays performed such antics, it
would be easy to get rid of them by receiving without aerials. But, as a
matter of fact, a wire buried in the ground which, conforming to this
view, should be absolutely immune, is more susceptible to certain
extraneous impulses than one placed vertically in the air. To state it
fairly, a slight progress has been made, but not by virtue of any
particular method or device. It was achieved simply by discerning the
enormous structures, which are bad enough for transmission but wholly unsuitable for reception and adopting a more appropriate type of receiver. As I have said before, to dispose of this difficulty for good, a
radical change must be made in the system and the sooner this is done
the better.

It would be calamitous, indeed, if at this time when the art is in its
infancy and the vast majority, not excepting even experts, have no
conception of its ultimate possibilities, a measure would be rushed
through the legislature making it a government monopoly. This was
proposed a few weeks ago by Secretary Daniel's and no doubt that
distinguished official has made his appeal to the Senate and House of
Representatives with sincere conviction. But universal evidence
unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained in
healthful commercial competition. there are, however, exceptional
reasons why wireless should be given the fullest freedom of
development. In the first place, it offers prospects immeasurably greater
and more vital to betterment of human life than any other invention or
discovery in the history of man. Then again, it must be understood that
this wonderful art has been, in its entirety, evolved here and can be
called "American" with more right and propriety than the telephone, the
incandescent lamp or the airplane.

Enterprising press agents and stock jobbers have been so successful in
spreading misinformation, that even so excellent a periodical as the
"Scientific American," accords the chief credit to a foreign country. The
Germans, of course, gave us the Hertz waves and the Russian, English,
French and Italian experts were quick in using them for signaling
purposes. It was an obvious application of the new agent and
accomplished with the old classical and unimproved induction coil,
scarcely anything more than another kind of heliography. The radius of
transmission was very limited, the result attained of little value, and the
Hertz oscillations, as a means for conveying intelligence, could have
been advantageously replaced by sound waves, which I advocated in
1891. Moreover, all of these attempts were made three years after the
basic principles of the wireless system, which is universally employed
today, and its potent instrumentalities had been clearly described and
developed in America.

No trace of those Hertzian appliances and methods remains today. We
have proceeded in the very opposite direction and what has been done is
the product of the brains and efforts of citizens of this country. The
fundamental patents have expired and the opportunities are open to all.
The chief argument of the Secretary is based on interference. According
to his statement, reported in the New York Herald of July 29th, signals
from a powerful station can be intercepted in every village in the world.
In view of this fact, which was demonstrated in my experiments in 1900,
it would be of little use to impose restrictions in the United States.
As throwing light on this point, I may mention that only recently an odd
looking gentleman called on me with the object of enlisting my services
in the construction of world transmitters in some distant land. "We have
no money," he said, "but carloads of solid gold, and we will give you a
My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla
Pg. 41liberal amount." I told him that I wanted to see first what will be done
with my inventions in America, and this ended the interview. But I am
satisfied that some dark forces are at work, and as time goes on the
maintenance of continuous communication will be rendered more
difficult. The only remedy is a system immune against interruption. It
has been perfected, it exists, and all that is necessary is to put it in
operation.

The terrible conflict is still uppermost in the minds and perhaps the
greatest importance will be attached to the Magnifying Transmitter as a
machine for attack and defense, more particularly in connection with TELAUTAMATICS. 

This invention is a logical outcome of observations
begun in my boyhood and continued throughout my life. When the first
results were published, the Electrical Review stated editorially that it
would become one of the "most potent factors in the advance of
civilization of mankind." The time is not distant when this prediction will
be fulfilled. In 1898 and 1900, it was offered by me to the Government
and might have been adopted, were I one of those who would go to
Alexander's shepherd when they want a favor from Alexander! At that
time I really thought that it would abolish war, because of its unlimited
destructiveness and exclusion of the personal element of combat. But
while I have not lost faith in its potentialities, my views have changed
since. War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence
is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet
on which we live. Only though annihilation of distance in every respect,
as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies
and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day,
insuring permanency of friendly relations. What we now want most is
closer contact and better understanding between individuals and
communities all over the earth and the elimination of that fanatic
devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride, which is always
prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No league
or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. These
are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong.
I have expressed myself in this regard fourteen years ago, when a
combination of a few leading governments, a sort of Holy alliance, was
advocated by the late Andrew Carnegie, who may be fairly considered as
the father of this idea, having given to it more publicity and impetus
than anybody else prior to the efforts of the President. While it can not
be denied that such aspects might be of material advantage to some less
fortunate peoples, it can not attain the chief objective sought. Peace can
only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and
merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization,
because few indeed, will admit the reality that God made man in His
image in which case all earth men are alike. There is in fact but one race,
of many colors. Christ is but one person, yet he is of all people, so why
do some people think themselves better than some other people?
As I view the world of today, in the light of the gigantic struggle we have
witnessed, I am filled with conviction that the interests of humanity
would be best served if the United States remained true to its traditions, true to God whom it pretends to believe, and kept out of "entangling alliances." Situated as it is, geographically remote from the theaters of
impending conflicts, without incentive to territorial aggrandizement,
with inexhaustible resources and immense population thoroughly
imbued with the spirit of liberty and right, this country is placed in a
unique and privileged position. It is thus able to exert, independently, its
colossal strength and moral force to the benefit of all, more judiciously
and effectively, than as a member of a league.

I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early life and told of an
affliction which compelled me to unremitting exercise of imagination and
self-observation. This mental activity, at first involuntary under the
pressure of illness and suffering, gradually became second nature and
led me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of free
will in thought and action and merely responsible to the forces of the
environment. Our bodies are of such complexity of structure, the
motions we perform are so numerous and involved and the external
impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusive,
that it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact. Yet nothing is
more convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic theory
of life which had been, in a measure, understood and propounded by
Descartes three hundred years ago. In his time many important
functions of our organisms were unknown and especially with respect to
the nature of light and the construction and operation of the eye,
philosophers were in the dark.

In recent years the progress of scientific research in these fields has
been such as to leave no room for a doubt in regard to this view on
which many works have been published. One of its ablest and most
eloquent exponents is, perhaps, Felix le Dantec, formerly assistant of
Pasteur. Professor Jacques Loeb has performed remarkable experiments
in heliotropism, clearly establishing the controlling power of light in
lower forms of organisms and his latest book, "Forced Movements," is
revelatory. But while men of science accept this theory simply as any
other that is recognized, to me it is a truth which I hourly demonstrate
by every act and thought of mine. The consciousness of the external
impression prompting me to any kind of exertion, physical or mental, is
ever present in my mind. Only on very rare occasions, when I was in a
state of exceptional concentration, have I found difficulty in locating the
original impulse. The by far greater number of human beings are never
aware of what is passing around and within them and millions fall
victims of disease and die prematurely just on this account. The
commonest, everyday occurrences appear to them mysterious and
inexplicable. One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rack his brain
for an explanation, when he might have noticed that it was caused by a
cloud cutting off the rays of the sun. He may see the image of a friend
dear to him under conditions which he construes as very peculiar, when
only shortly before he has passed him in the street or seen his
photograph somewhere. When he loses a collar button, he fusses and
swears for an hour, being unable to visualize his previous actions and
locate the object directly. Deficient observation is merely a form of
ignorance and responsible for the many morbid notions and foolish ideas prevailing. There is not more than one out of every ten persons who
does not believe in telepathy and other psychic manifestations,
spiritualism and communion with the dead, and who would refuse to
listen to willing or unwilling deceivers?

Just to illustrate how deeply rooted this tendency has become even
among the clear-headed American population, I may mention a comical
incident. Shortly before the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in
this city elicited widespread comment in the technical papers, I
anticipated that there would be a scramble among manufacturers to get
hold of the invention and I had particular designs on that man from
Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for accumulating millions. So
confident was I, that he would turn up some day, that I declared this as
certain to my secretary and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning a
body of engineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves
with the request of discussing with me an important project. "Didn't I
tell you?," I remarked triumphantly to my employees, and one of them
said, "You are amazing, Mr. Tesla. Everything comes out exactly as you
predict."

As soon as these hardheaded men were seated, I of course, immediately
began to extol the wonderful features of my turbine, when the
spokesman interrupted me and said, "We know all about this, but we are
on a special errand. We have formed a psychological society for the
investigation of psychic phenomena and we want you to join us in this
undertaking." I suppose these engineers never knew how near they
came to being fired out of my office. Ever since I was told by some of the
greatest men of the time, leaders in science whose names are immortal,
that I am possessed of an unusual mind, I bent all my thinking faculties
on the solution of great problems regardless of sacrifice. 

For many years
I endeavoured to solve the enigma of death, and watched eagerly for
every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the course of my
existence have I had an experience which momentarily impressed me as
supernatural. It was at the time of my mother's death. I had become
completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance, and one night was
carried to a building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless
there, I thought that if my mother died while I was away from her
bedside, she would surely give me a sign. Two or three months before, I
was in London in company with my late friend, Sir William Crookes,
when spiritualism was discussed and I was under the full sway of these
thoughts. I might not have paid attention to other men, but was
susceptible to his arguments as it was his epochal work on radiant
matter, which I had read as a student, that made me embrace the
electrical career. I reflected that the conditions for a look into the
beyond were most favorable, for my mother was a woman of genius and
particularly excelling in the powers of intuition. During the whole night
every fibber in my brain was strained in expectancy, but nothing
happened until early in the morning, when I fell in a sleep, or perhaps a
swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty,
one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the
features of my mother. 

The appearance slowly floated across the room
and vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And that was true. I was
unable to understand the tremendous weight of the painful knowledge I
received in advance, and wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still
under the domination of these impressions and in poor bodily health.
When I recovered, I sought for a long time the external cause of this
strange manifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded after many
months of fruitless effort.

I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representing allegorically
one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angels which
seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully. It
was exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of
my mother's likeness. The music came from the choir in the church
nearby at the early mass of Easter morning, explaining everything
satisfactorily in conformity with scientific facts. This occurred long ago,
and I have never had the faintest reason since to change my views on
psychical and spiritual phenomena, for which there is no foundation. The
belief in these is the natural outgrowth of intellectual development.
Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in their orthodox meaning, but
every individual clings to faith in a supreme power of some kind.
We all must have an ideal to govern our conduct and insure
contentment, but it is immaterial whether it be one of creed, art,
science, or anything else, so long as it fulfills the function of a
dematerializing force. It is essential to the peaceful existence of
humanity as a whole that one common conception should prevail. While
I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions of
psychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete
satisfaction the automatism of life, not only through continuous
observations of individual actions, but even more conclusively through
certain generalizations. these amount to a discovery which I consider of
the greatest moment to human society, and on which I shall briefly
dwell.

I got the first inkling of this astonishing truth when I was still a very
young man, but for many years I interpreted what I noted simply as
coincidences. Namely, whenever either myself or a person to whom I
was attached, or a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in a
particular way, which might be best popularly characterized as the most
unfair imaginable, I experienced a singular and undefinable pain which,
for the want of a better term, I have qualified as "cosmic" and shortly
thereafter, and invariably, those who had inflicted it came to grief. After
many such cases I confided this to a number of friends, who had the
opportunity to convince themselves of the theory of which I have
gradually formulated and which may be stated in the following few
words: Our bodies are of similar construction and exposed to the same
external forces. This results in likeness of response and concordance of
the general activities on which all our social and other rules and laws are
based. We are automata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium,
being tossed about like corks on the surface of the water, but mistaking
the resultant of the impulses from the outside for the free will. 

The movements and other actions we perform are always life preservative
and though seemingly quite independent from one another, we are
connected by invisible links. So long as the organism is in perfect order,
it responds accurately to the agents that prompt it, but the moment that
there is some derangement in any individual, his self-preservative power
is impaired.

Everybody understands, of course, that if one becomes deaf, has his
eyes weakened, or his limbs injured, the chances for his continued
existence are lessened. But this is also true, and perhaps more so, of
certain defects in the brain which drive the automaton, more or less, of
that vital quality and cause it to rush into destruction. A very sensitive
and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism all intact,
and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of the
environment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense,
enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. When he
comes in contact with others whose controlling organs are radically
faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the "cosmic" pain.
The truth of this has been borne out in hundreds of instances and I am
inviting other students of nature to devote attention to this subject,
believing that through combined systematic effort, results of
incalculable value to the world will be attained. The idea of constructing
an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itself to me early, but I
did not begin active work until 1895, when I started my wireless
investigations. During the succeeding two or three years, a number of
automatic mechanisms, to be actuated from a distance, were
constructed by me and exhibited to visitors in my laboratory. In 1896,
however, I designed a complete machine capable of a multitude of
operations, but the consummation of my labours was delayed until late
in 1897. This machine was illustrated and described in my article in the
Century Magazine of June, 1900; and other periodicals of that time and
when first shown in the beginning of 1898, it created a sensation such
as no other invention of mine has ever produced. 

In November, 1898, a
basic patent on the novel art was granted to me, but only after the
Examiner-in-Chief had come to New York and witnessed the
performance, for what I claimed seemed unbelievable. I remember that
when later I called on an official in Washington, with a view of offering
the invention to the Government, he burst out in laughter upon my
telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then that there
was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device. It is unfortunate
that in this patent, following the advice of my attorneys, I indicated the
control as being affected through the medium of a single circuit and a
well-known form of detector, for the reason that I had not yet secured
protection on my methods and apparatus for individualization. As a
matter of fact, my boats were controlled through the joint action of
several circuits and interference of every kind was excluded.
Most generally, I employed receiving circuits in the form of loops,
including condensers, because the discharges of my high-tension
transmitter ionized the air in the (laboratory) so that even a very small
aerial would draw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours. Just to give an idea, I found, for instance, that a bulb 12 inches in diameter, highly exhausted, and with one single terminal to
which a short wire was attached, would deliver well on to one thousand
successive flashes before all charge of the air in the laboratory was
neutralized. The loop form of receiver was not sensitive to such a
disturbance and it is curious to note that it is becoming popular at this
late date. In reality, it collects much less energy than the aerials or a
long grounded wire, but it so happens that it does away with a number
of defects inherent to the present wireless devices.

In demonstrating my invention before audiences, the visitors were
requested to ask questions, however involved, and the automaton would
answer them by signs. This was considered magic at the time, but was
extremely simple, for it was myself who gave the replies by means of the
device. At the same period, another larger telautomatic boat was
constructed, a photograph of which was shown in the October 1919
number of the Electrical Experimenter. It was controlled by loops,
having several turns placed in the hull, which was made entirely
watertight and capable of submergence. The apparatus was similar to
that used in the first with the exception of certain special features I
introduced as, for example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible
evidence of the proper functioning of the machine. These automata,
controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were, however, the
first and rather crude steps in the evolution of the art of Telautomatics
as I had conceived it.

The next logical improvement was its application to automatic
mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at great distances from the
center of control, and I have ever since advocated their employment as
instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance of this
now seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual
announcements through the press, of achievements which are said to be
extraordinary but contain no merit of novelty, whatever. In an imperfect
manner it is practicable, with the existing wireless plants, to launch an
airplane, have it follow a certain approximate course, and perform some
operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine of this
kind can also be mechanically controlled in several ways and I have no
doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war. But there are to my
best knowledge, no instrumentalities in existence today with which such
an object could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted
years of study to this matter and have evolved means, making such and
greater wonders easily realizable.

As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at college I
conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying
principle was sound, but could not be carried into practice for want of a
prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years, I have
successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial machines
*devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers, and other external*
attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and are very
likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. 

Such a
machine, sustained and propelled "entirely by reaction," is shown on one of the pages of my lectures, and is supposed to be controlled either
mechanically, or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants, it will
be practicable to "project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it"
almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles
away.

But we are not going to stop at this. Telautomats will be ultimately
produced, capable of acting as if possessed of their own intelligence, and
their advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898, I proposed to
representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and
public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would
perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to
judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at the time and
nothing came of it. At present, many of the ablest minds are trying to
devise expedients for preventing a repetition of the awful conflict which
is only theoretically ended and the duration and main issues of which I
have correctly predicted in an article printed in the SUN of December 20,
1914. The proposed League is not a remedy but, on the contrary, in the
opinion of a number of competent men, may bring about results just the
opposite.

It is particularly regrettable that a punitive policy was adopted in
framing the terms of peace, because a few years hence, it will be
possible for nations to fight without armies, ships or guns, by weapons
far more terrible, to the destructive action and range of which there is
virtually no limit. Any city, at a distance, whatsoever, from the enemy,
can be destroyed by him and no power on earth can stop him from doing
so. If we want to avert an impending calamity and a state of things
which may transform the globe into an inferno, we should push the
development of flying machines and wireless transmission of energy
without an instant's delay and with all the power and resources of the
nation.

The End
