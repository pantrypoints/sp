---



Fresnel's second supplement to his first memoir on Double Refraction was presented to the Academy on November 26, 1821[62].

It indicated the lines on which his theory might be extended so as to take account of dispersion:

"The molecular groups, or the particles of bodies may be separated by intervals which, though small, are certainly not altogether insensible relatively to the length of a wave." 

Such a coarse-grainedness of the medium would, as he foresaw, introduce into the equations terms by which dispersion might be explained.

The theory of dispersion which was afterwards given by Cauchy was actually based on this principle. It seems likely that, towards the close of his life, Fresnel was contemplating a great memoir on dispersion,[63] which was never completed.

Fresnel had reason at first to be pleased with the reception of his work on the optics of crystals: for in August, 1822, Laplace spoke highly of it in public. 

At the end of the year a seat in the Academy became vacant, he was encouraged to hope that the choice would fall on him. 

In this he was disappointed.[64] 

Meanwhile, his researches were steadily continued. In January, 1823, the very month of his rejection, he presented to the Academy a theory in which reflexion and refraction[65] are referred to the dynamical properties of the luminiferous media.

As in his previous investigations, he assumes that the vibrations which constitute light are executed at right angles to the plane of polarization. 

He adopts Young's principle, that reflexion and refraction are due to differences in the inertia of the aether in different material bodies, and supposes (as in his memoir on Aberration) that the inertia is proportional to the inverse square of the velocity of propagation of light in the medium.

The conditions which he proposes to satisfy at the interface between two media are that the displacements of the adjacent molecules, resolved parallel to this interface, shall be equal in the two media, and that the energy of the reflected and refracted waves together shall be equal to that of the incident wave.

On these assumptions the intensity of the reflected and refracted light may be obtained in the following way:—

Consider first the case in which the incident light is polarized in the plane of incidence, so that the displacement is at right angles to the plane of incidence; let the amplitude of the displacement at a given point of the interface be f for the incident ray, g for the reflected ray, and h for the refracted ray.

The quantities of energy propagated per second across unit cross-section of the incident, reflected, and refracted beams are proportional respectively to

where c1, c2, denote the velocities of light, and ρ1,ρ2 the densities of aether, in the two media, and the cross-sections of the beams which meet the interface in unit area are

cos i, cos i, cor r

respectively. The principle of conservation of energy therefore gives


The equation of continuity of displacement at the interface is

```
f + g = h.
```

Eliminating h between these two equations, and using the formulae

we obtain the equation

Thus when the light is polarized in the plane of reflexion, the amplitude of the reflected wave is

 the amplitude of the incident vibration.

Fresnel shows in a similar way that when the light is polarized at right angles to the plane of reflexion, the ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected and incident waves is

These formulæ are generally known as Fresnel's sine-law and Fresnel's tangent-law respectively. They had, however, been discovered experimentally by Brewster some years previously. When the incidence is perpendicular, so that i and r are very small, the ratio of the amplitudes becomes

...

where μ2 and μ1 denote the refractive indices of the media. 'This formula had been given previously by Young[66] and Poisson,[67] on the supposition that the elasticity of the aether is of the same kind as that of air in sound.

When i + r = 90°, tan (i + r) becomes infinite: and thus a theoretical explanation is obtained for Brewster's law, that if the incidence is such as to make the reflected and refracted rays perpendicular to each other, the reflected light will he wholly polarized in the plane of reflexion.

Fresnel's investigation is not a dynamical theory since the qualities of the medium are not defined.

His method was to work backwards from the known properties of light, in the hope of arriving at a causal mechanism.

He was able to account for the phenomena with a few simple principles.

But he was not able to specify an aether which would in turn account for these principles. 

The "displacement" of Fresnel could not be a displacement in an elastic solid of the usual type, since its normal component is not continuous across the interface between two media.

The theory of ordinary reflexion was completed by a discussion of the case in which light is reflected totally. 

This had formed the subject of some of Fresnel's experimental researches several years before .

He presented 2 papers to the Academy in November 1817 and January 1818 where he had shown that light polarized in any plane inclined to the plane of reflexion is partly "depolarized" by total reflexion.

This is due to differences of phase which are introduced between the components polarized in and perpendicular to the plane of reflexion. 


{{< l a="Fresnel" >}}
When the reflexion is total, rays polarized in the plane of reflexion are reflected nearer the surface of the glass than those polarized at right angles to the same plane, so that there is a difference in the paths described.
{{< /l >}}


This change of phase he now deduced from the formulae already obtained for ordinary reflexion. Considering light polarized in the plane of reflexion, the ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected and incident light is, as we have seen,

...

when the sine of the angle of incidence is greater than μ2/μ1, so that total reflexion takes place, this ratio may be written in the form

...

where θ denotes a real quantity defined by the equation

...

Fresnel interpreted this expression to mean that the amplitude of the reflected light is equal to that of the incident, but that the two waves differ in phase by an amount θ. The case of light polarized at right angles to the plane of reflexion may be treated in the same way, and the resulting formulae are completely confirmed by experiment.

A few months after the memoir on reflexion had been presented, Fresnel was elected to a seat in the Academy, and during the rest of his short life honours came to him both from France and abroad.

In 1827, the Royal Society awarded him the Rumford medal; but Arago, to whom Young had confided the mission of conveying the medal, found him dying; and eight days afterwards he breathed his last.

By the genius of Young and Fresnel the wave-theory of light was established in a position which has since remained unquestioned. 

It seemed almost a work of supererogation when, in 1850, Foucault[70] and Fizeau,[71] carrying out a plan long before imagined by Arago, directly measured the velocity of light in air and in water, and found that on the question so long debated between the rival schools the adherents of the undulatory theory had been in the right.

 Roemer, in a letter to Huygens of date 30th Dec., 1677, mentions a suspected displacement of the apparent position of a star, due to the motion of the earth at right angles to the line of sight. Cf. Correspondance de Huygens, vii, p. 53,
 Struye in 1845 found for the constant of aberration the value 20″·445, which he afterwards corrected to 20″·463. This was superseded in 1883 by the value 20″·492, determined by M. Nyrén. The observations of both Struve and Nyrén were made with the transit in the prime vertical. The method now generally used depends on the measurement of differences of meridian zenith distances (Talcott's method, as applied by F. Küstner, Beobachtungs-Ergebnisse der kön. Sternwarte zu Berlin, Heft 3, 1888): the value at present favoured for the constant of aberration is 20″·523. Cf. Chandler, Ast. Journal, xxiii, pp. 1, 12 (1903).
The collective translatory motion of the solar system gives rise to aberrational terms in the apparent places of the fixed stars; but the principal term of this character does not vary with the time, and consequently is equivalent to a permanent constant displacement. The second-order terms (i.e. those which involve the ordinary constant of aberration multiplied by the sun's velocity) might be measurable quantities in the case of stars near the Pole; and the same is true of the variations in the first-order terms (i.e. those which involve the sun's velocity not multiplied by the constant of aberration) due to the circumstance that the star's apparent R. A. and Declination, which occur in these terms, are not constant, but are affected by Precession, Nutation, and Aberration. Cf. Seeliger, Ast. Nach., cix., p. 273 (1834).

 Fresnel's law may also be deduced from the principle that the amount of light transmitted by a slab of transparent matter must be the same whether the slab is at rest or in motion: otherwise the equilibrium of exchanges of radiation would be tiated. Cf. Larmor, Phil. Trang. eixxxv (1893), p. 776.

 It was not published until 1819, in Annales de Chimie,; Fresnel's Œuvres, i, p. 509. By means of this result, Fresnel was able to give a complete explanation of a class of phenomena which Arago had discovered in 1811, viz. that when polarized light is transmitted through thin plates of sulphate of lime or mica, and afterwards analysed by a prism of Iceland spar, beautiful complementary colours are displayed. Young had shown that these effects are due essentially to interference, hut had not made clear the part played by polarization.

 This analogy had been given by Hooke in a communication to the Royal Society on Feb. 15, 1671-2. But there seems no reason to suppose that Hooke appreciated the point now advanced by Young,
 Annales de Chimie, xvii (1821), p. 180; Œuvres, i, p. 629. Young had already drawn attention to this point. "It is difficult," he says in his Lectures on Natural Philosophy, ed. 1807, vol. i, p. 138, "to compare the lateral adhesion, or the force which resists the detrusion of the parts of a solid, with any form of direct cohesion. This force constitutes the rigidity or hardness of a solid body, and is wholly absent from liquids."

 His first memoir ou Double Refraction was presented to the Academy on Nov. 19th, 1821, but has not been published except in his collected works: Œuvres, ii, p. 261. It was followed by other papers in 1822; and the results were finally collected in a memoir which was printed in 1827, Mém. de l'Acad. vii, p. 45, Œuvres, ii, p. 479.
 In attempting to reconstruct Fresnel's course of thought at this period, the present writer has derived much help from the Life prefixed to the ''Œuvres de Fresnel. Both Fresnel and Young were singularly fortunate in their biographers: Peacock's Life of Young, and this notice of Fresnel, which was the last work of Verdet, are excellent reading.
 It is evident from this that the optic axes, or lines of single wave-velocity, along which there is no double refraction, will be perpendicular to the two circular sections of the surface of elasticity.
 Another construction for the wave-surface is the following, which is due to MacCullagh, Coll. Works, p. 1. Let the ellipsoid

be intersected by a plane through its centre, and on the perpendicular to that plane take lengths equal to the semi-axes of the section. The locus of these extremities is the wave-surface.
