<!-- I will now speak of the mode of encampment sanctioned by the regulation of Lycurgus.  -->

To avoid the waste incidental to the angles of a square, (1) the encampment, according to him, should be circular, except where there was the security of a hill, (2) or fortification, or where they had a river in their rear. 

He had sentinels posted during the day along the place of arms and facing inwards; (3) since they are appointed not so much for the sake of the enemy as to keep an eye on friends. The enemy is sufficiently watched by mounted troopers perched on various points commanding the widest prospect.

<!--  (1) Or, "Regarding the angles of a square as a useless inconvenience,
    he arranged that an encampment should be circular," etc. See
    Polyb. vi. 31, 42.

 (2) Cf. "Hell." VI. iv. 14; Polyaen. II. iii. 11, ap. Schneider.

 (3) Lit. "these," {tas men}. Or, "He had lines of sentinels posted
    throughout the day; one line facing inwards towards the place of
    arms (and these were appointed, etc.); while observation of the
    enemy was secured by mounted troopers," etc. -->

To guard against hostile approach by night, sentinel duty according to the ordinance was performed by the Sciritae (4) outside the main body. At the present time the rule is so far modified that the duty is entrusted to foreigners, (5) if there be a foreign contingent present, with a leaven of Spartans themselves to keep them company. (6)

<!--  (4) See Muller's "Dorians," ii. 253; "Hell." VI. v. 24; "Cyrop." IV.
    ii. 1; Thuc. v. 67, 71; Grote, "H. G." vii. 110.

 (5) See "Hipparch." ix. 4.

 (6) Reading {auton de}. The passage is probably corrupt. See L.
    Dindorf ad loc. -->

The custom of always taking their spears (7) with them when they go their rounds must certainly be attributed to the same cause which makes them exclude their slaves from the place of arms. Nor need we be surprised if, when retiring for necessary purposes, they only withdraw just far enough from one another, or from the place of arms itself, not to create annoyance. The need of precaution is the whole explanation.

 <!-- (7) See Critias, ap. Schneider ad loc. -->

The frequency with which they change their encampments is another point. It is done quite as much for the sake of benefiting their friends as of annoying their enemies.

The law enjoins upon all Spartans, during the whole period of an expedition, the constant practice of gymnastic (8) exercises, whereby their pride (9) in themselves is increased, and they appear freer and of a more liberal aspect than the rest of the world. 

(10) The walk and the running ground must not exceed in length (11) the space covered by a regimental division, (12) so that no one may find himself far from his own stand of arms. After the gymnastic exercises the senior polemarch gives the order (by herald) to be seated. 

This serves all the purposes of an inspection. After this the order is given "to get breakfast," and for "the outposts (13) to be relieved." After this, again, come pastimes and relaxations before the evening exercises, after which the herald's cry is heard "to take the evening meal." 

When they have sung a hymn to the gods to whom the offerings of happy omen had been performed, the final order, "Retire to rest at the place of arms," (14) is given.

<!--  (8) Cf. Herod. vii. 208; Plut. "Lycurg." 22 (Clough, i. 113 foll.)

 (9) Reading {megalophronesterous} (L. Dindorf's emendation) for the
    vulg. {megaloprepesterous}. Xen "Opusc. polit." Ox. MDCCCLVI.

 (10) Or, "the proud self-consciousness of their own splendour is
    increased, and by comparison with others they bear more notably
    the impress of freemen."

 (11) The word {masso} is "poetical" (old Attic?). See "Cyrop." II. iv.
    27, and L. Dindorf ad loc.

 (12) A single mora, or an army corps.

 (13) Or, "vedettes," {proskopon}. See "Cyrop." V. ii. 6.

 (14)? Or, "on your arms." See Sturz, "Lex. Xen." s.v. -->
 
If the story is a little long the reader must not be surprised, since it would be difficult to find any point in military matters omitted by the Lacedaemonians which seems to demand attention.
