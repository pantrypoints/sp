title: Social Superphysics
description: "In Vedic Philsophy, the soul (atman) is part of the oversoul (paramatman). We use this to explain how a society is a soul-orgnism made up of individual souls as its citizens or people. <p class='pt-4 text-lg dark:text-gray-200'>Social Superphysics is divided into Supersociology (Non-Economic Social Superphysics) based on Socrates and Ibn Khaldun, and Supereconomics (Economic Superphysics) based on Socrates and Adam Smith.</p>"
