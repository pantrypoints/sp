To fix modern China, we have to look into ancient China. 

Only China and India have such long histories that we have to split their solutions. 


The main problem of ancient China manifested as foreign invasion or wars:

1. Mongol invasion
2. Opium wars

The root of both problems spring from the Song dyansty which is its most prosperous Golden Age. 

This is similar to the fall of Rome happening after the prosperity of Pax Romana.
