The current decline of Germany, made obvious by the collapse of its government, comes from the wrong policies of the Merkel era -- it is strange how Germany wasted away its nuclear energy and heavy industries.

Her strange policies are mistakes that mixed up bad policies:
- US-style liberalism
- USSR-style socialism

This is because after WW2, Germany was split into two:
- the liberal West
- the socialist East

After unification:
- the liberal policy privatized industry for dependence to Western capital markets
- the socialist policy stifled energy for dependence to Russia

{{< i s="/flags/de.png" a="Germany" >}}


So these 2 forces merge and mutate into Merkel's weird policies that are now destroying Germany.

The fight between East and West Germany can be seen in their current lack of government, while:
- Trump is cutting off German goods
- Putin cuts off Russian gas

In contrast:
- China was never liberalized, and so its industry and energy can stay strong. It opened up to market forces under Deng, but Deng was still in control
- Japan was liberalized, but not socialized, and so its stock market is still up, in sync with that of the US
- French energy, as EDF, is mostly owned by the French government and is stronger than that of Germany

We could blame Hitler for WW2 and creating a split Germany. So we have to look into why Germany began the World Wars.


<!-- But the Nazis were actually voted by the people. So the 2020s people can blame the 1930s people. -->


## Hypothesis on German Involvement in The World Wars 

By reading the works of Kepler, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Einstein, and Hitler, a common theme comes out: **the Germans think differently** from the rest of Western Europe (UK, France, Italy, Spain). 

**This is because they were never Romanized.**

{{< i s="/photos/medieval/rome.jpg" a="Rome" c="Germany was never fully under Roman influence" >}}


After the Fall of the Roman Empire, the heart of Europe shifted to Venice.
- From there, it shifted to Spain
- Then it moved to France. 

This is why events in France, such as the French Revolution of 1789 and 1848, affected other European nations especially Germany. 

In other words, Germany is metaphysically subordinate to France. This is proven by their defeat in both World Wars.

Russia in turn is metaphysically subordinate to Germany as proven by:
- Catherine the Great and
- the relatively quick 'liberation' of Eastern Germany during WW2

Both the German and Russian oversoul have being non-Romanized* as a common feature.

{{< n n="*The British oversoul really applies to the world and not to Europe. This explains why it could do Brexit in 2016.We can think of Britain as the Roman Empire as a modern maritime power instead of as a land power.">}}



### The Rise of Mercantilism and Finance

The cause of most of the problems in Europe from the 18th to the 20th centuries was the Mercantile system.
- This now manifests as finance and the systemic speculation in commodities, stocks, and futures. 

This system began in England and Amsterdam and was applied to the top and bottom of society (both rich and poor).
- And so, the British and the Dutch learned to join the system by being speculators. Even Isaac Newton speculated in stocks.

In contrast, in France and Germany, Mercantilism did not seen to trickle down to the masses.
- So when inflation came, the poor were caught in it as the losers, instead of being part of the winners that caused the inflation.

The poor would then need someone to blame. And so they ended up blaming their top classes:
- the monarchs
- the rich people (bourgeoisie)

On the other hand, the poor English and Dutch would merely blame their bad luck for losing in their gambles.
- It would be natural for them to attribute their loss to a lack of skill or intellect. 

This is most obvious with Americans who have since come up intellectual tools like algorithmic trading, predictive machine learning, and the Black-Scholes model just to improve their gambling. 

This explains why there were far less protests against the US government after the 2008 Financial Crisis than the French or German governments during the 18th and 19th centuries. 

<!-- For example, they entered the colonization game late -->

### Financiers Versus Soldiers

In Socrates' 4-class system:
- the financiers are oligarchs. These were the merchants.
- the military are tyrants. These were the monarchs.

These 2 classes are diametrical opposites, just as laborers are opposites of intellectuals.

{{< i s="/graphics/social/cycles.png" a="Social Cycles" c="The warrior class is opposite of the trading class" >}}


The 1900s-1910s were the transition years in Europe from monarchy into oligarchy. This is seen in the 'stab on the back' which caused Germany to lose WW1. 

This led Hitler to blame the Jews, and start a new world war after getting rid of them in Germany. 

{{< q a="Adolf Hitler" c="Mein Kampf, Volume 2, Chapter 9" >}}
The Jews blamed the loss of the world war on Ludendorff -- the only adversary likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice.

In an alternate universe where Germany was unified without liberalism nor technocacy, energy and some key industries would be partly state owned. 

This would raise industrial production to be at par with China per capita, even more than Japan which used the liberal 3 Arrows Abenomics. 

There would be no need to peddle the 4th industrial revolution since China was able to grow without it or even AI. They just focused on common sense heavy industry which is not appealing to investors who prefer shiny things.



## The Solution

The Germany problem is two-fold:

1. It lost WW2 and ended up with 2 rival vibrations within: The American and Soviet
2. It was not Romanized, making it incompatible with laissez faire (since the US is the carrier of the Roman vibration)

The first step is to unify Germany by making the Roman influence subordinate to the native Germanic vibration. 
- This means reducing the liberal policies inherited from West Germany. 

The next step is to adopt the **Nordic Model**, specifically that of Norway. This is because:
- the Nordic countries were also not Romanized
- Germany is not as barren as Russia which also was not Romanized
- Norway has state-owned corporations needed for energy and a strong industrial base
- the welfare state is the opposite of the hierarchal Roman system and American laissez-faire

Until Germany has returned to its natural Germanic vibration*, there should be no coalition government. This is because a coalition might respect the Roman vibration when it should be subdued.   

{{< n n="All Superphysics solutions ultimately aim at finding one's core inherent vibration, as the Socratic 'true nature' or dharma" >}}


The tariffs imposed by Trump on Germany is actually a good thing because it will correctly cut off or reduce the American vibration. 

{{< i s="/photos/countries/us/trump.jpg" a="Trump" c="Germany needs to split from the US" >}}


In addition, the war in Ukraine will cut off or reduce the Russian vibration through the cutting of Russian gas supplies.

These 2 events might be seen as bad. But they are really good for those who adopt a positive, yet unattached Taoist or Buddhist mentality of seeing things in a balanced way.


### The Best Choice

Germany will hold elections in February for a new government. Of the candidates and parties, the best one to fit the solution is **Sahra Wagenknecht of the left-wing BSW party**.


{{< i s="/photos/countries/de/sahra.jpg" a="Sahra" c="Sahra Wagenknecht and BSW is a better choice than AfD" >}}


The worst would be the CDU which created the problem in the first place. 

The SPD and the AfD, via Alice Weidel, will neither be effective as Elon Musk claims, since they also do not strike at the root cause.

In any way, the best policy for Germany is to switch to the Nordic model by choosing a party that has a plan for it.
