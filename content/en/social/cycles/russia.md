## The Russia-Ukraine war

The Russia-Ukraine war really began *in abstract* on February 8, 2022 when the French President Macron failed to get the Russian President Putin to change his plan to attack Ukraine which actually began on February 24. 

{{< img src="/photos/countries/ru/war.jpg" alt="Russian Invasion" >}}


<!-- That led to Putin to decide the attack to commence on February 16. This was leaked by the US, and so Putin delayed it to  The attack began oFebruary 22, starting with his unilateral declaration of the Ukranian provinces Donetsk and Lugansk as being free from Ukraine. -->

The blame for all this can be put on Biden and somewhat on Macron:
- Biden for not agreeing to Putin's demands to stay away from Ukraine
- Macron for focusing on Putin instead of on Biden


To explain why, we shall apply Socratic Dialectics by:
- getting real data
- matching that data with the abstract flow of ideas and feelings

This will create a pattern of cause and effect.

The feelings of society* and of its leaders are the core of Social Superphysics which allows it to predict events in and between societies.  


{{< f f="So far, the authors who were keen enough to perceive such feelings, as well as explain their metaphysical dynamics, were David Hume, Lao Tzu, and Ibn Khaldun (who explains it as 'group feelings')" >}}


## The Balance of Power is Based on the Preservation Instinct

<!-- The Feelings of Putin and Russia -->

Putin's feelings were made known in his speech on February 21 wherein he blamed the incursion of NATO and the EU into Ukraine.

He said that this violated their 1994 Agreement to keep Ukraine away from the military and economic influence of both Russia and the US-UK.

This has been clear and known to the relevant world leaders.

This feeling is based on the "balance of power" which is a concept from the 18th century.

It was unknown in ancient Europe but seems to have been known in China, as proven by Sun Tzu's Art of War:


{{< q a="Sun Tzu" c="The Art of War, Chapter 1 and 4" >}}
The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him...The consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres to method and discipline. Thus it is in his power to control success.
{{< /q >}}


Western academics mistakenly think that the balance of power is a man-made policy meant to prevent wars. This is why they say that it has been disproven.

In reality, the balance of power is based on **the natural instinct of self-preservation**. Some leaders have more of this instinct, others do not. 

{{< q a="Polybius" >}}
Hiero acted with great wisdom and prudence when he retained his dominions in Sicily so that Carthage would be safe while preserving the Roman friendship. If Carthage fell, the Romans without contrast or opposition would be able to act at will.
{{< /q >}}


Putin's war in Ukraine is his attempt to preserve the balance of power to secure the existence of Russia. This balance was lost after NATO destroyed Iraq and Libya, and nearly destroyed Syria*. 

{{< d t="Update Dec 2024" >}}
The fall of Syria to Islamists, indirectly supported by Israel's attacks on Syria, proves that Putin's fears were valid.
{{< /d >}}


 <!-- The current war is really between the 2 Negative Forces as the financial industry (Trader Class) and autocratic leaders (Warrior Class). The Negative Worker Class gets mixed is as populists, along with some Negative Thinker class as Islamists.   -->

## The Modern Balance of Liberalism Versus Non-Liberalism

After the French Revolution, the two ideologies that emerged in Europe* were Liberalism versus Non-Liberalism.

A key marker for the idea of Liberalism is **human rights**. 

This idea does not exist in any philosophical system anywhere from the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Confucians, to the modern Islam and Sikhs.

It seems to have incubated as [the Magna Carta](/research/countries/england/magna-carta/article-1/) of King John of England in 1215 as a response to the excessive strength of the barons which was really an effect of the weakness of the King.

China, Arabia, Persia, and India never had to institute human rights because the dynastic power was always able to keep order.

<!-- The latter Roman Empire extended rights to barbarians and ended up getting destroyed since it takes a huge amount of effort and many generations to unify group-feelings (We estimate that 60-80 years is needed minimum at maximum effort). Ancient China seems to have been able to do this. -->


## The Roman Collapse

The Romans:
- never had to institute universal human rights because the Senate and Emperor were usually in control
- only gave rights to Romans and not to barbarians whose [group-feelings](/research/ibn-khaldun/muqaddimah/chapter-2/part-16) were in a different moral level. 


The collapse of the Roman Empire happened because it:
- extended Roman rights to barbarians in 212 AD (Pax Romana was until 180 AD)
- adopted Catholicism in 380 AD

The barbarians had a different mental wavelength from Romans. Calling them Romans is to classify disparate waves as a single wave. This is like giving all test-takers a passing mark regardless if they scored high or failed. 

{{< i s="/graphics/psych/grades.jpg" a="Grades" c="The corruption of morals happens when a society becomes rich as it strengthens the influence of the material world" >}}


This happens if the test-failers grew far more powerful than the test-passers, that they would want everyone to pass. In this way, only the barriers to taking the test would be the real barrier. 

In Rome, these barriers were the physical boundaries. The metaphysical cultural and intellectual barriers were removed and only the physical barriers remained. 


## What's Wrong With Human Rights?

The main problem with human rights is that a human body can be inhabited by souls with different levels of soul-advancement. This manifests as varying mental vibrations which leads to very different behaviors.

Some souls might be:
- animal souls -- these have been animals for a long time and incarnated as human for the 1st time
- humans souls -- these have been human for many incarnations
- advanced souls -- these have been advanced aliens, elementals, or spirits

A human with an animal soul will act likely like an animal. This is how we explain the wicked behavior of serial killers who chop and even eat their victims. It would be absurd to grant such people human rights just because their animal-souls occupy human bodies. 

This is more commonly seen in corrupt politicians who gain power in animalistic ways. In our system, it would be valid to deny Hitler human rights after his mental wave was exposed by his novel *Mein Kampf*.

Bio Superphysics classifies people based on physical, mental, and spiritual criteria aligning with the 7 chakras. So there might be working dogs or cats that get rights to a living animal wage, while a jailed terrorist gets none. The current sciences regard the chakras as pseudo science unworthy of being studied. And so Science locks itself out of the solution, when in Cartesian Physics, chakras are a core principle, in line with aethereal vortices and animal spirits (chi in Taoism).

{{< i s="/photos/bio/dog.jpg" a="Dog" c="In our system, animals can get human rights, just as humans can be demoted to animal rights. Our system is not physical or body-based, but metaphysical as being based on the soul's actual behavior through time" >}}



## Both Liberalism and Non-Liberalism are Natural

In Europe, the conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism was replaced by Liberalism versus Non-Liberalism. It then spread to the world through the colonial system. 

The mentalities in Asia are different, such as Hinduism-Buddhism versus Islam in India, Confucianism versus Taoism in China, and Shia versus Sunni in Arabia.

According to Nature's Law of Diversity, both Liberalism and Non-Liberalism have an equal right to exist.
- The problem begins when one mentality tries to overwhelm or cancel the other. 

<!-- An example of a total rout of one mentality is the fall of the Roman Empire to the German barbarians, which started the European Dark Ages.  -->

Normally, the heightened opposition of 2 mentalities leads to war:

- Liberal Capitalism and Non-liberal Communism led to the Cold War 
- Catholicism vs Protestantism led to the 30 Years' war
- Modern Maoism vs Traditional Chinese culture led to the Cultural Revolution
- The different religions in India led to internal conflicts


According to Adam Smith:
- Liberalism is the natural effect of living in a fertile land with a nice climate
- Non-liberalism is the natural effect of living in a barren land with a harsh climate

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Lectures on Jurisprudence Simplified, Part 1, Chapter 3" >}} 
Generally,the situation of a country, and its improvement in agriculture and trade are favourable to the introduction of a republican government. There is little probability that republican governments will ever be introduced into Tartary or Arabia, because their country cannot be improved. 
{{< /q >}}

This principle is matched by biology wherein:
- peaceful (liberal) banobos are observed to live in food-rich areas
- warlike (non-liberal) chimpanzees live in food-scarce areas

{{< i s="/photos/bio/bonobo.jpg" a="Bonobos" c="The abdundance of food makes banobos have mental waves similar to liberals" >}}


Accordingly, we see that:
- the free societies such as those in Italy, France, and England have good, fertile lands
- the non-free societies such as Afghanistan and Japan have non-arable lands, while Arabia and Russia have hot and frozen climates respectively

<!-- The inland parts of China are desert or flooded, creating a naturally non-liberal society.
This is because  -->

Fertile lands reward hard work generously. Planting wheat in a fertile land leads to a bountiful harvest, letting free enterprise and the freedom to work make sense.

Barren lands, on the other hand, do not reward hard work at all. No matter how hard a desert-person irrigates a desert, Nature will not reward him. In fact, it would make more sense for him to invade a fertile land where his work will be rewarded by loot. This then leads to harsh laws. A proof is Moses punishing the Levites severely in the desert.

**The problem begins when a liberal person imposes liberalism on a non-liberal land, and when a non-liberal person imposes non-liberalism on a liberal land.** 

- The former was done by the US in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya
- The latter was done by Al-Qaeda onto the US, France, and England as terrorist attacks


## Ukraine is Caught Between Liberalism and Non-liberalism 

The discord between Ukraine and Russia is from the fact that:
- Ukraine is fertile
- Russia is barren

The story is that the Rus people originated as Slavs in Kiev, who then branched out into Russia. 

The problem began when the Mongols invaded. Ukranian cities like Kiev refused to surrender their freedom, but Russian cities like Novgorod surrendered (possibly being used to non-freedom). 

This led to the destruction of Kiev in 1240. 

The Mongols then strengthened Moscow in order to create a new **balance of power** between Russia and Poland (Lithuania). 

This made Moscow the center of the Rus people ever since.

In Social Superphysics, the birth and early development of a society is extremely important just as it is important to a human because it determines how it will behave later as an adult. This behavior is called "culture".

The social cycles of Western mentalities have a lifespan of 8 cycles lasting 480 years on average. 

It shows that Russia:
- is in its 5th cycle which began with Catherine the Great who annexed Ukraine from Poland and the Crimea from Turkey. 
- entered a militant cycle in 2022, which explains why it launched its attack this year instead of in 2014 after Euromaidan.


Cycle | Mentality
--- | ---
1 | Catherine the Great
2 | Nicholas I
3 | Alexander III
4 | Cold War
5 | Putin


This means that **Russia is in the 2nd season of its 5th cycle in the age that began with Catherine the Great**.*


{{< f f="*Our notation for social cycles is similar to the regnal year method of Asia and the European monarchs. For example, Year 1 of Japan's Reiwa era began on May 1, 2019. Reiwa Year 1 (based on Naruhito's ascension) is the equivalent of 2019 (based on Jesus' birth year)" >}}


Ukraine's independent history is quite short, starting from 1991. It does not form any known pattern yet.

Russia's pattern is from 1263, making it easy to plot. A better alternative would be to plot Ukraine's history from 482 AD when Kyiv was founded.

However, there is **a lot of missing information** between 482 and 2014 (Euromaidan). This would make any pattern a result of guesswork which can never be a foundation of any rigorous Superphysics prediction.

## The Solution for Ukraine: Learn from the past. Don't get too temped by European wealth

So we know why Russia (and Belarus) is doing what it's doing. 

But we don't know why Ukraine is suddenly shifting towards the EU and NATO belatedly when Yugoslavia shifted much earlier. 

It clearly has an identity crisis, which we can only trace to the fall of Kiev in 1240 when it did not surrender to the non-liberal Mongols.

But it is merely repeating the same mistake in 2022 by not surrendering to Putin. 

A barabarian would treat such non-surrendering as an affront which would be deal with it severely. This explains the harsh measures done by the Soviets against Ukraine.  

Instead of acting like its barbarian neighbors, Ukraine was urged on by the love of liberty and wealth which is not common in that part of the world. This is because it knows that it has an asset in its fertile land. (Update 2025: We add minerals as fertile mines).

This violates the Law of Nature, leading to the problems that afflicts those who go against Nature. 

Two solutions would've nipped the problem at the bud:

1. Biden agreeing to honor the 1994 agreement and not include Ukraine in NATO or the EU
2. Ukranian President Zelensky and his government fleeing to Poland in exile by February 26, as suggested by the US

These solutions would have preserved the balance of power and allowed the non-liberal forces to enjoy their natural right to exist.

Unfortunately:
- the West is still infected with the Liberalism virus from the French Revolution
- Russia is still very much entrenched in Catherine the Great's imperialism

These 2 opposing forces clash in Ukraine. 

This disturbance has its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union which then has its roots in World War 1, and then to Napoleon, and then to **the French Revolution**, matching cause with effect. 

**The current solution is still for Ukraine to surrender, the earlier the better.**

<!-- ## Unifiying with Russia and the Mongols Instead of Europe and the Romans -->

<!-- Had those two solutions been adopted, the recovery of the Russian and Ukrainian economy could have been done by a **Germany-backed** Marshall Plan centered on Ukraine. This would turn Ukraine into a Russian commercial center which can slowly help de-Mongolize Moscow and unify the Rus while being within **Catherine the Great's Europe-leaning vision**.

But because Ukraine did not surrender, Russia will totally cut it off from the West, more in line with the **Mongol vision** *. Ukraine's reconstruction will likely be funded by China (which is also under an imperial Mongol mentality as the Chinese Communist Party). This pattern is consistent with China being its largest trading partner in 2019. 


> *Here, we stay unbiased and do not imply that the European vision is better than the Mongol and vice versa. Both have their pros and cons, just as the non-liberalism of lockdowns and vaccine-mandates saved lives during Covid, while liberalism caused superspreader events and deaths. 
 

The great big metaphysical question is: 

**Why is the Europe-leaning vision giving way to the Mongol vision?**

The answer is that the Western civilizations have started to decline from the 2000s. This is proven by:

- The 9/11 attack supported by the lowly Taliban
- The 2008 Financial and Eurozone Crisis inflicted by Western banks on themselves

Civilizations that have achieved peak wealth and prosperity have nowhere to go but down. This is proven by the fall of the Romans, Persians, and Song dynasties. The West reached their peak wealth in the 1990s from the low of the 16th century. On the contrary, China had its low period with the fall of the Qing, replaced by the Mao era, and has nowhere to go but up*. -->


<!-- The feudalism is a natural effect of difficulties with the land such as its barreness, extreme heat, extreme cold, or frequent natural disasters. The rise of the militant explains why Navalny's protest did not succeed -- because it was 10 years late.
 -->

<!-- > *The recent win of India's BJP in the elections in Uttar Pradesh also hint that India is also on the rise. In addition, the growth of KPop and Korea culture from the last decade is another supporting proof.  -->


## The Solution for Russia: Make the World Understand Mongol Rules

The proper way to 'fix' Russia, under this Mongol-trend, is for the world to simply **allow the concept of non-liberalism to exist**.

This will then relax the feelings of Russia (and China) leading to less tensions. This will then allow both liberalism and  non-liberalism to spread and find the proper balance.

(Update Oct 2025: Because Ukraine did not surrender, the liberal West and the non-liberal Russian-Chinese have to double down and speed up the polarization of the world unnaturally)

The Mongol system is based on few simple rules that are sacred to simple barbarians*. **The key is to work within those simple rules.** A policy solution could be to allow Ukraine to fall to Russia on the condition that Russia does not expand beyond those borders. 


{{< f f="*We have worked extensively with dirt-poor communities and have gotten used to how barbaric and even animalistic some humans can become. This is why we base human rights on actual behavior and not on having a human body. The solution is to lower onself to their level and then painstakingly raise them up slowly by finding the gravitational signature (svadharma) for each mind." >}}



## The US Pushes Freedom Just to Make More Money

This is very different from the current mode of thinking of the West wherein they see the destruction of non-liberalism as a moral and just cause that is worth pursuing agressively. 

<!-- Their egos blind them to the fact that such a mentality has caused so many unnecessary conflicts since the 19th century.
- The World Wars and the current Ukraine war are modern examples of the effects of such thinking.  -->

Liberalism is like a modern crusade being undertaken by the West which has nothing better to do with its productivity. Ideally, all that productivity should be channeled to the exploration of Mars. The problem is that the West blindly believes in Einstein's [General Relativity scam](/material/fallacies/scam) which makes anti-gravity out of reach.

The error of the Western worldview is clearly seen in nonliberal Afghanistan falling back to the nonliberal Taliban in 2021 despite tons of effort by the US to liberalize it.

If Biden were consistent in wanting to stamp out nonliberalism from the planet, then the US should've drained its taxpayer money to civilize and "liberalize" the Afghans, which [we estimate to take 80 years](/social/cycles/afghanistan). 
- This is similar to how a father can impoverish himself just to give the best education for his child.
- This would make the actions of the US match its advocacy, and be a clear sign of its truthfulness and high morals. 



{{< i s="/photos/countries/af.jpg" a="Afghanistan" c="Liberals believe that money solves all problems and so they simply throw money at problems" >}}

In reality, the West just liberalizes places which have resources. This is like:
- a shrewd parent who only supports the children who can bring in money
- a bank that only gives loans to those who have collateral

Both these cases are really business deals*, not a social moral duty.

{{< d t="Update Feb 2025" >}} 
This is proven by the victory of Trump under the 'Make America Great Again' MAGA ideology wherein he wants allied countries to pay up. 
{{< /d >}} 


Therefore, **democracy is just a cover for greed** to spread its tentacles, just as autocracy is a cover for the spread of simple-mindedness.

Had Ukraine surrendered:
- its people wouldn't need to become refugees
- its infrastructure would've stayed intact 
- the animosity between Russia and Ukraine wouldn't become extreme

Russia would change its cycle in 15 years anyway, allowing a relaxation of its nonliberal policies towards Ukraine. By that time, its union with Ukraine could even spur democracy in Russia itself, in a natural, painless way. 

This is similar to how North Vietnam should've surrendered to South Vietnam and gotten freedom anyway, along with generous US aid to exploit its resources, without going through the horrors of war.
