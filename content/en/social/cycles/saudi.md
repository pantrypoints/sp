The Islamic Golden Age happened because the Abbasid caliphate moved their capital to Baghdad to be closer to Persia to attract foreign talent. It’s similar to how Dubai is trying to attract talent because it knows it will have nothing when the oil runs out. Most of the scientists in the ‘House of Wisdom’ were Persian. Yes, they did make a lot of scientific writings, but did it lead to any invention which were mass produced to be sold and earn revenue? No. 

Ibn Khaldun already observed how the Arabs wasted this opportunity in my original answer.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_inventions_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world

It’s just the would be like Dubai trying to attract all the commercial investment.
