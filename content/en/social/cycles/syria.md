The Assad regime fell on Dec 8, 2024.



<!-- Initially, we thought that Syria was in an Intellectual Cycle because of ISIS’ initial success (Intellectual) and because Hafez Al Assad was a military man (Warrior). However, the model break down when ISIS started to lose ground in 2016. So we looked into Hafez Al Assad’s mentality and found that he was really an Intellectual so I retrained the model with that fact and led to a current Laborer cycle which fits better with the current reality.

Syria’s cycles last 21 years and is currently in a Laborer cycle which started in 2012. I speculate that Syria descended into Civil War because the Arab Spring unnaturally rushed Syria into the Laborer cycle prematurely by 1 year.  Since Warriors naturally give order to Laborers, the encroachment of foreign militaries (Russia in 2015) is not surprising. According to this pattern, there predicted outcomes are:
- In time, the groups in Syria would be reduced to 2 factions: FSA vs Assad (Laborer vs Laborer)
- The winning group will be the one that can be more warrior-like
- The YPG, being a weaker Laborer group, would be absorbed into those 2 groups
- There would be more military action in Syria towards 2020 as the Warrior starts to emerge
