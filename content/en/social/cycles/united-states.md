Negative Warrior | 17 |

<!-- 
America is only superficially based on Adam Smith. If it were really 100% Smithian, then it would still be part of Britain and the British capital would move from London to Washington as envisioned by Smith, which we shall call a Neo-British empire. In that way, British industry would develop American industry so that:

(1) there would have never been a US civil war
(2) American goods would be improved to be sold to the British empire that never slept, tax free. This would have raised the moral standards of the British merchants so that they would not have traded opium with the Chinese and caused the opium war. (Historically, the US colonized countries through regime change instead of drug dealing)
(3) Any world war would've been quickly defeated by the Neo-British empire preventing many deaths


Trump’s two terms is merealy a manifestation of the Negative oscillating and fightng the Positive. 


The goal of an impeachment is to disqualify a President from "enjoying any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States" because he did high crimes and misdemeanor. I would classify the 3 non-New York convictions as high crimes.

After he loses honor and position, then he can be grilled by whatever law: "the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."

The main problem with Trump is that things happened temporally in reverse. He was convicted first and then gained honor and position later. In other words, he was impeached even before becoming President. That was the Democrat strategy because they knew that none of them were as popular as Trump especially since their wars (to keep the world stable) have made Democrats unpopular. 

So by saying he can pardon himself means that the entire justice system (police investigation, due process, jury, lawyers, jurisprudence, etc) can be thrown away and bypassed if the masses vote to free a criminal every 4 years. So why have a justice system when the police can just let the people vote on whether a suspect is innocent or not (Jesus v. Barabas)?

The current Warrior mentality manifests as the belligerent attitude of Trump supporters which invaded the Capitol, as well as increased racism and police brutality. -->


<!-- Real America vs Liberal America

The American founding fathers put God as the ruler over freedom (liberalism), as proven by "In God We Trust."

Bible Belt states as the Real America. However, the  Civil war north against the South non-liberal south which preferred slavery. 

This led to God being replaced by liberalism and therefore ambition, money, and property. This led to expansionism as the Spanish-Ameican War and then entry into WWI and WWII. It will likely see-saw between liberalism (financial crisis, globalism) and noniberalism (anti-vaxxer, racism) around every 200 years or so.
