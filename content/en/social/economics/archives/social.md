Social companies are business organizations that are a hybrid of cooperatives and corporations. These follow the principles of Adam Smith laid out in The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments. 

These are limited to around 100 people which 'combine' or 'socialize' with other social companies to form bigger organizations that grow organically. They have their own regulatory body and are funded by social banking, which are social companies engaged in banking. 

Unlike commercial banks, social banks are confined to their respective localities, have less capital, but are more numerous. Unlike investment banks, they invest in local businesses and give loans to locals only. They also use commodity-based valuation, manifesting as either a gold standard, 'rice' standard, or 'wheat' standard, depending on what commodity each locality prefers to use in settling accounts. This is a safeguard against financial crises and credit crunches by allowing economic activity to continue through barter. 

Each locality will be encouraged to save into their social banks which will then invest the money or physical assets into social companies. For example, unemployed cleaners can organize a social company with funds or materials loaned by social banks to start their own cleaning services using their own network.

Single mothers can form social daycare companies for other children while young people can create social retirement companies to take care of their aged. Since their creditors will be located in the same town, their business performance can be monitored daily and be assisted by experts. After gaining more experience, social companies can connect and share resources with those from other towns to be able to better compete with profit-minded corporations which give lower wages.

My country, the Philippines, has a lot of poverty despite having a lot of natural resources. I have been looking into solutions to poverty since high school by joining volunteer groups and, later, cause-oriented organizations like the Jaycees and Rotary and corporate social responsibility initiatives by my employers. After many years of personal research, I have pinpointed the cause of poverty to neo-classical economic theory which I found to naturally cause inequality through profit maximization. By tracing economic history, I found the solution through the works of Englightenment authors such as Adam Smith and David Hume who explained the root cause of greed and economic problems and gave solutions to address the negative aspects of human nature. Even if my idea doesn't win, I hope to get the idea of an alternative economic science out to decision-makers before inequality further rises to oppressive heights and before worse economic crises hit.  

<!-- As my research goes against Economic thinking, I have no choice but to implement it through a grassroots approach.   -->
