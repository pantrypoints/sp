The Asian Crisis was caused by the liberalization agenda pushed by the IMF, part of which was opening up of FDI. Here is a paper that proves how open FDI added to that crisis:

"Regarding capital account liberalization, the [Korean] Government increased the ceiling on aggregate foreign ownership of listed shares from 26 to 55 percent and eliminated the ceiling completely by end-1998, and raised individual foreign ownership from 7 to 50 percent"

"The [Korean] Government originally encouraged the entry of foreign banks mainly to promote the inflow of foreign capital"

This matches the observation of another paper ("Lending Booms, Real Estate Bubbles, The Asian Crisis") which has the following policy recommendations: 

"Capital Account Liberalization must be carefully phased in, in line with domestic regulation. Some observers recommend a more restrictive approach to debt flows...Policy [should control] the property sector to moderate price movements. Singapore followed this route in 1996, increasing land taxes..thus helping deflate land prices"

So Singapore did the fiscal approach to mitigate the Asian Crisis while the PH did the constitutional restriction approach. 

The Asian Crisis caused riots in Indonesia, the fall of Suharto, the fall of Erap, and the rise of Thaksin. 

Somehow there is an obsolete belief that liberalization will create competition and stability. This has thoroughly disproven by frequent crisis, but also by the giant monopolies and too-big-to-fail banks in the US.

Singapore used fiscal measures to restrict land ownership. PH uses citizenship. Same same but different. 

Foreign investors were allowed to invest directly in Korean stocks in 1992, subject to a general ceiling on total foreign holdings of any one company’s outstanding shares. The ceiling was raised several times until it reached 55 percent at end-1997, and it was finally abolished by end-1998, according to the IMF program.
