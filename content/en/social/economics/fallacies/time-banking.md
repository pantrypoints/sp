We first heard of time-Banking after the 2008 Financial Crisis, more or less at the same time as the Venus Project. 

Unlike the Venus Project which is fanciful, time-banking is already done in a few countries as early as the 19th century. 

However, its core problem is that it is based on time, which is the same basis of money which has the time value of money. 

The main difference is that time banking does not seem to impose interest rates, while money does. The interest rates is a consequence of it being a legal tender. This adds a premium to it. 

Unlike Time-banking, Points-banking is based on life. This allows it to scale. 


## Time-Banking: Based on Time

1. Equal Value
2. Reciprocity
3. Community Building


## Points-Banking: Based on Life and the Four Laws of Value

1. Zero Waste / Maximum Utilization
2. Subjective Value
3. Reciprocity
4. Expansion / Diversity
