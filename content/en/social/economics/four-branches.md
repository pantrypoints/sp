## Four Branches

Currently, Economics has messy divisions arising from the lack of understanding of the nature of societies and the human species:

- Microeconomics
- Macroeconomics
- Development Economics
- Welfare Economics
- Behavioral Economics
- Political Economy

[The Four Laws of Value](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-04) of Superphysics streamlines this into four branches:



### 1. Personal Economy from The First Law

This includes demographic data, as well as personal physical and psychological data in order to see the granular supply and demand of any society. 

This is measured by the Demand factor in the DCTI model. <!-- It  manifests as the user profile -->


### 2. Social Economy from The Second Law

This provides the valuation system, as the Effort Theory of Value, which is based on the common food grain. This monitors the real price of everything, which is the key to preventing poverty, inequality, and crises, while maximizing productivity and personal and social happiness within the limits of the natural environment.  

This is measured by the Capital factor in the [DCTI model](/social/economics/principles/part-4/chapter-07).

<!-- gives info on the relative indices between cities and countries, showing their relative aggregate supply and demand, measured in grain through the grain index. This manifests as our proposed centralized indicators portal -->


### 3. Micro Economy from The Third Law

This explains the principles behind the transactions of the value between people and societies. This leads to organized markets and free trade.

This is measured by the Trade factor in the DCTI model. 


### 4. Macro Economy from The Fourth Law

This explains the maintenance of the economic system. This includes regulations, taxation, policies of money, trade, and finance.

This is measured by the Industry factor in the DCTI model. 



## The 4 Classes

[The 4 classes](/social/supersociology/principles/part-1/chapter-05) then have a domain in each of the 4 economies:

Class | Economy
--- | ---
Workers and Democrats | Personal Economy
Intellectuals and Aristocrats | Social Economy
Businessmen and Oligarchs | Micro Economy
Warriors and Tyrants | Macro Economy
