Supereconomics classifies value into buyer-seller, and personal-societal, leading to 4 kinds of value.

Supereconomics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable (Buyer's perspective) | **Nominal Price** (value in currency) | **Market Price** (value to the buyer)
Objective and Natural or Invariable (Seller's perspective) | **Real Price** (value in grain or labour) | **Natural Price** (value to the seller)


Economics, on the other hand, has no concept of Real and Natural Price because it has no concept of society as an objective entity.  
- It purposely rejects the importance of society because it enshrines selfishness, as a result of being dominated by the Negative Force.
- This Negative Force also facilitates division, crudity as materialism, war, conflict, racism, etc.

To pursue selfishness, Economics teaches:
- arbitrage
- profit maximization
- finance and money-only exchange
- private sensory pleasures.

As a result, it only has:
- economic value (nominal price)
- market value (market price)

Economics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable | **Nominal Price** (value in currency) | **Market Price** (value to the buyer)





## Integrating Personal and Societal 

Superphysics views a society as a metaphysical organism or oversoul that is made up of individual souls, just as a soul is a metaphysical organism made up of many selves. 

{{< q a="David Hume" >}}
I can only compare the soul to a republic with several members united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination. This gives rise to other persons who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. The same republic may change its members, laws, and constitutions.  
{{< /q >}}

Supereconomics (Economic Superphysics) uses this to integrate the personal soul, as one's gives-and-takes, with the social soul, as the gives-and-takes of the economic system. 

This lets us summarize and organize our 4 prices into a pattern:

Law | Price | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Utilization - exposes the lack and the need
2 | Real | Specialization - drives action to increase quality and quantity to deal with the lack
3 | Natural | Balance - prevents the crashes that leads to a recurrence of lack
4 | Market | Diffusion - spreads quality and quantity to address the lack

{{< i s="/graphics/econ/law4th.jpg" a="Prices" >}}


Law | Definition
--- | --- 
1 | Every thing in the universe has an existential value, otherwise it would not exist
2 | Value is created to remove the lack in society
3 | Natural | Balance - prevents the crashes that leads to a recurrence of lack
4 | Market | Diffusion - spreads quality and quantity to address the lack

{{< youtube sDTrScP67yI >}}


We find that it exactly matches the Law of Social Cycles of Supersociology:

Cycle | Price
--- | --- 
Worker | Nominal 
Warrior | Real 
Thinker | Natural
Trader | Market  


## The Four Laws of Value

From here, we can connect Supereconomics with Supersociology by making them the Four Laws of Value. 

Law | Price | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Everything in the universe has value
2 | Real | Value is created to address lack
3 | Natural | There must be balance in the creation and spread of value
4 | Market | Value is spread through fair exchange

<!-- from the conversion of matter or ideas -->

Since we equate value to desire and desire in the physical domain is energy, then we can connect these 4 laws to the laws of thermodynamics:

Supereconomics Law | Physics Thermodynamics Law
--- | ---
1 - Nominal | 0 - Equilibrium (Wavelength)
2 - Real | 1 - Conservation (Frequency or Density)
3 - Natural | 3 - Absolute Zero (Amplitude)
4 - Market | 2 - Entropy (Spread)


<!-- 1 - Nominal | 3 - A system's entropy reaches a constant value as its temperature reaches absolute zero
2 - Real | 1 - Energy can be conerted from one form to another, but cannot be created nor destroyed
3 - Natural | 0 - If 2 systems are in thermal equilibrium with a 3rd system, then they are in equilibrium with each other
4 - Market | 2 - Entropy will always increase over time -->


{{< i s="/graphics/econ/laws.png" a="Laws of Value" >}}


<!-- - The 2nd and 1st law of thermodynamics refer to the external aspects of waves just as the Market and Real Price are objective 
- The 3rd and 0th laws refer to the internal aspects just as the Nominal and Market Price are subjective -->


## How We Got the Four Laws from Adam Smith

We got the Four Laws by noticing a pattern in the maxims of Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations* which we distilled the maxims into 4 factors as:

1. Demand
2. Capital
3. Supply
4. Trade

We then compared these with the Four laws of Thermodynamics to fine-tune and harmonize the Four Laws of Supereconomics with:
- The Four Laws of thermodynamics of Physics
- The Four Cycles of Supersociology (which historically was the Hindu varna system)

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations Book 4, Chapter 2, Paragraphs 3-9" >}}
The general industry of..society never can exceed what the capital of..society can employ (Law 2)… Every individual.. necessarily endeavours.. that his produce be of the greatest.. value (Law 2)… or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money or of other goods (Law 4).  The annual revenue of society..is the same thing with that exchangeable value (Law 4).
{{< /q >}}



{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations Book 1, Chapter 10, Paragraph 49" >}}
The quantity of industry.. is.. regulated by the annual demand so that the average annual produce is equal to the average annual consumption (Law 1).
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations Book 2, Chapter 2, Paragraph 37" >}}
When we compute the quantity of industry.. we must always have regard to.. provisions, materials, and finished work. Money.. must always be deducted (Law 2)
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations Book 2, Chapter 2, Paragraph 60" >}}
If the paper money never exceeds this value.. it can never exceed  what the circulation of the country can.. absorb and employ (Law 3).
{{< /q >}}


## So What's the Four Laws of Value

The Four Laws of Value, like the other laws of Physics and Supersociology, arise from the wave-nature of the universe that flows in a certain way. 
- This flow is called the Tao in Taoism
- This "certainess" is called the Dharma in Hinduism

Going against the flow leads to problems. And so the Four Laws prevents or solves economic problems or problems that involve exchangeable value.  

A common personal problem is budgeting -- people have no money to buy what they need or want. 

Supereconomics uses the Fourth Law as fair exchange, with or without money, to reestablish a barter-credit system where people pay in their own goods or services by finding other people who would want their goods or services. 

This requires people to value, and assign a value, to the work of other people and then trade for them by their own agreements, even without money. 

The Four Laws extend to all economic phenomena (and problems). This makes it a tool for policy-making, whether for the personal, national, or global economy. 

For example, violations of the Four Laws lead to economic problems and crises:

Law | Violation Results in
--- | ---
First Law | Overspending, Budget Deficit, Poverty Cycle, Unemployment
Second Law | Valuation Errors, Bubbles, Overinvestment, Underinvestment
Third Law | Inequality, Moral Hazard, Financial Crises, Illicit goods
Fourth Law | Inflation, Recessions, Trade War, Crypto Scams




<!--  we can see how the four laws of value are the reverse of the laws of thermodynamics. For example:
- the First law or the Conservation of Energy is the 'first' in Physics, but is the third in Supereconomics, as trade
- the Third law, as absolute zero, is the last in Physics, but is the first in Supereconomics as its First law, as everything having a value. -->

<!-- Superphysics law | Thermodynamics law counterpart
--- | ---
1st | 3rd 
3rd | 2nd
4th | 1st
2nd | 0th -->


<!-- Zeroth Law =  thermal equilibrium.
If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. In simpler terms, it says that two objects at the same temperature will be in thermal equilibrium if placed in contact.

First Law = law of conservation of energy
Energy can only be transformed from one form to another. The total energy of a closed system remains constant.  This law forms the basis of various engineering applications such as power generation and refrigeration.

Second Law = entropy disunity in a system.
Any spontaneous process, the disorder of the isolated system increases. Closed systems get more disunited over time.

Third Law = disorder decreases as temp goes to absolute zero. absolute zero cannot be reached in practice. -->


<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our 'equation' for demand and supply as ps:pd{{< s v="D" >}}. This overturns the mercantilist 'Law' of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:

![4](/images/graphics/eglwmg.png)
*Our eagle equation for all kinetic movementfits into both the Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Value. The image above is for potental movement (I noticed that some physicists tend to be very fussy about the difference between potential and kinetic energy)*

We find that these four laws match the four factors of our [DCIT model](/posts-pantrynomics/the-demand-capital-industry-trade-model/) which is made up of:

| **Factor** | **Law of Value** | **Value** | **Model** | **Physics equivalent** | **Supereconomic system** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand | First | Natural Price | GPFY | Higgs Field | Basic Universal Revenue <br> as store of value <br> and the Grain Index | Basis of economic justice <br> which is lacking in both <br> Capitalism and Communism |
| Capital | Second | Real Price | GUE | Gravitation (we gravitate <br> towards certain interests <br> based on our dharma) | Effort Theory of Value <br> ISAIAH Match | Leads to economic democracy <br> and maximized non-commercial potential|
| Industry | Third | Nominal Price <br> (value in currency) | GGAMS | Strong Layer | Real Price via <br> the Economic Table | Economic balance or stasis <br> that is lacking in Capitalism |
| Trade | Fourth | Market Price <br> (value to the buyer) | GRID | Electroweak | Exchange systems with maintenance cost | Regulates merchants as <br> the opposite of Mercantilism |
