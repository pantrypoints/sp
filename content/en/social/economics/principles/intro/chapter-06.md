Supereconomics is concerned with the material well-being of society. 

It is the revival of Classical Economics, backed up by actual data which spans 2,500 years, from Xenophon's The Economist up to the latest GDP data.

Unlike Neoclassical Economics which only focuses on money, revenue, and business, Supereconomics deals with both private wealth generation and public policy. This is in line with Classical Economics which was previously called the Political Economy. 

As such, we divide this book into four parts, with each part representing a law of exchangeable value.

These create a supereconomic science that is very different from the current one.

## The Huge Knowledge Gap in Economics

Economics creates crises because of the huge gaps in knowledge about the nature of society and the self, since it only had 150 years of data on human behavior. An easy proof of the limitation of Economics is the Law of Supply is Demand is taught, but not [the Four Laws of Value](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-03/) that lead to that Law of Supply and Demand

In contrast, Superphysics has over 2,500 years of knowledge from principles and data collected by philosophers before they were converted into scientists or researchers

<!-- In contrast, Modern Economics only began from the Marginal Revolution of the 1870's. 

This makes its dataset very small, making it unable to find causal patterns. This leads to sophistical theories that cause so many problems when they are actually implemented.
