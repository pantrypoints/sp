Supereconomics is part of Social Superphysics which sees society as a metaphysical organism called an oversoul made up of individual souls. 

A soul is an abstract mind, which can think. 

Each soul expresses its needs, as demand, and capabilities, as supply. 

We can say that demand is inbound value or energy going to a soul, while supply is outbound value or energy from a soul. 

This creates a flowing current between souls in a society, as actors in an economy.


## Fellow Economic Feeling

This flow is called "group feeling" in Supersociology and "fellow economic feeling" in Supereconomics. 

You can put a price on a material desire, but not so much on a general desire. 

For example, you can pay or not pay someone to cook for you that is still regarded as fair. 

- Paying for something is an economic or commercial transaction
- Not paying for something is a supereconomic or barter-credit transaction (as donation or exchange for something in the future)


We call this fellow economic feeling as *common economic interest*. 

This separates us from savages or animals that simply steal from other savages or animals. This is because they have no fellow feeling with them. 

But a civilized species has more fellow-feeling thanks to the **Positive Force** which unites entities. 

This drives our heart to give back something for what we got since the Positive Force makes us feel his needs somewhat. 

Unlike Economics which is based on the **Negative Force**, as matter and selfishness, Supereconomics is based on the Positive Force, as aether and svadharma.


## Selfish Interest Versus or Svadharma as Self-Purpose

**Svadharma** means personal dharma, which in this case means personal duty. 

{{< q a="Krishna" c="Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 3, Verse 35" >}}
It is better to do one's own duty, even he fails to succeed in doing the duty of another. It is better to die performing one's duty, than to do another's duty with fear. 
{{< /q >}}



Each person has a different passion or purpose in life. 

For example, a baker can bake better than he can brew beer, just as a brewer can brew better than he can bake. 

Their common economic interest then naturally lets the baker exchange his bread for beer and leave both of them better off. 


{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
The first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition of life and existence. The second is a dwelling. The third clothing and the like.. Each will bring the result of his labours into a common stock.. All things are produced more plentifully and easily when one man does one thing which is natural to him.
{{< /q >}}


This svadharma is the true creator of economic value that usually manifests as money. 

However, Economics ignores svadharma and instead focuses on the money that it creates. And so it goes after the effect instead of the cause.  

In order to emphasize cause instead of effect, we therefore replace 'self-interest' and 'personal passion' with **self-purpose**.

This means that the self was not created merely for the sake of existing, but to attain a goal or serve a duty. 

This will give the mind a general direction instead of going around aimlessly in circles.  


<!-- This metaphysical starting point is called the idea of the self. 
- The path taken by the self is then ruled by its interest as 'self-interest' which is an ambiguous word. 
- One may be 'interested' in pursuing material pleasures or in achieving spiritual goals. Western authors solve this by specifying an enlightened self-interest, as opposed to the ordinary one. 

But the word 'enlightened' is also unclear.
- Is stealing $1 more enlightened than stealing $1,000? 
- Is destroying a forest to build houses for the poor less enlightened than preserving it to reduce CO2 and global warming? --> 

<!-- To get rid of this ambiguity, we change the word 'interest' into 'purpose'   -->

<!-- For example, a banker's purpose in life is to do banking. 

But we cannot say that a bank robber's life-purpose is to rob banks. This is because if all banks stopped existing then the bank-robber would also not have any purpose in life. -->

<!-- - Who would ever honestly say that his soul exists on Earth to rob banks?  -->

 <!-- since everyone feels that robbing is wrong and therefore cannot be a life goal. -->

<!-- Stealing might be a life goal of other animal species. But it would result in them having a flat hierarchy of needs. -->


<!-- {{< i s="/graphics/econ/safety.jpg" a="A flat hierarchy of needs" c="Animals have a flat hierarchy of needs representing the lower chakras" >}}

If Bitcoin price is rising fast, then under Economics, you should buy it or be left out. 
- But in Supereconomics, only the crypto-trader should buy it because his life purpose is to trade crypto. 
- In this way, a Bitcoin crash will only affect the universe of crypto-traders and not everyone. -->

<!-- In this way, the entity is not made subservient to the lower material layer.
- This helps it keep its stability amidst the onslaught of material perceptions.  -->


<!-- {{< youtube ovpsuyRanw8 >}}

Monkeys (from where the human species came) are curious about objects and have been known to steal and run away with material objects. Thus, we can call humans that act as such as monkeys

## Everything has a value because everything has a purpose

In Taoism, the specific purpose of every thing is called *The Tao*.

Superphysics replaces the Cartesian paradigm, 'I think therefore I am' with 'It exists, therefore it perceives'. 

Supereconomics translates this into the world of utility: "It exists, therefore it has a purpose (to the Supreme)'.

If it has a purpose then it has a value. 

This leads to the First Law of Value.

A human with its limited knowledge, might not know immediately the value of a thing. 

And so, in Supereconomics, this law leads to the study of this svadharma or Tao of things in order to realize their value. 



<!-- The word 'purpose' has more in common with the word 'dharma' than 'interest'. 

Superphysics views existence as being a huge mind or Matrix which the Hindus call the *Brahma*. A thing would only exist in a mind if its Thinker had a purpose for it.

Thus, we can say that everything that you perceive has a purpose. Those that didn't have a purpose never existed or never was perceived by you. 

This purpose is what gives value to everything. 
 
In this way, a baker bakes because he feels that his life purpose is to bake and that he could happily spend his whole life baking. 
- His passion in baking naturally allows him to make excellent bread which gets a nominal price from the viewpoint of the buyers

Therefore, his passion in baking represents:
- the nominal price to his customers, as the First Law of Value
- the real price for himself, as the Second Law of Value

If you do what you are passionate about then utility will always be at a maximum and there will be no marginal utility. This is why Supereconomics can do without marginal utility.


This focus on svadharma, from the viewpoint of the seller, makes up the Effort Theory of Value which is an essential component of the Second Law of Value.  

In contrast, in Economics, a baker bakes because he is supposed to be chasing the profits as the money from bread sales. To get more money, he logically must:
- adulterate his goods
- drive his costs down
- automate instead of using manual labor
- raise his sales through marketing.

In other words, the economic baker is not a baker but a merchant masquerading as a baker. More commonly, the baker was brainwashed to become a merchant.

Supereconomics keeps the baker as a baker and the merchant as a merchant. This is to preserve the division of labor in society and put everyone in their proper supereconomic place. -->


<!-- Eastern philosophy is full of warnings and safeguards against utility and worldly pleasures because the latter ultimately causes bondage within the dualistic universe. 

If existence were a video game, then profits would be the high scores. Materialistic people would find themselves playing over and over again to reach the highest score which has no limits. In such a case, existence itself becomes a trap, tempting people to stay in the game without any time to get permanent rest. -->

<!-- 
By following one's path and purpose in life, then humans can better understand how their dualistic world works. So, by replacing utility with self-purpose, Supereconomics not only can help people generate and distribute value among each other, but also increase their chances of understanding the reason for their existence so that they can exist in harmony with everything else that exists. 

A key characteristic of a supereconomic implementation or a *supereconomy* therefore is that it gives lower stress in exchange and acquisition of goods or services than that in economic, capitalist, or communist systems. -->

<!-- the fallacy of money and utility leading to self-acutalization mirrors the fallacy of using drugs to create happiness and solve depression. Since we proposed to solve economic crises by starting from the metaphysical center and travel to the economic problem, it means that we can also solve psychological and bodily problems by starting with the metaphysical cause or the person's Tao, which we call the G. 

This will then be the job of Medical Superphysics. We can even use it to solve problems in Modern Physics -->
