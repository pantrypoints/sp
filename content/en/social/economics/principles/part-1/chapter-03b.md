The previous section explained that:
- paper money caused inflation
- paper stocks caused crashes
- paper checks caused bouncing checks

This was because paper lets people write any number that might not match the real value of the thing it was representing.  

In addition, money is not controlled by people, but by:
- the central bank as wholesaler of money 
- commercial banks as retailers

Cryptocurrencies were even worse because they had no third party regulating or securing or insuring them.  

This makes both fiat and cryptocurrencies problematic as stores of value. 


## Grains as Store of Value

Adam Smith's proposal was to use grains. 


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations Book 1, Chapter 5" >}}
From century to century, wheat is a better measure than silver because a unit of wheat will command more equally a unit of labour than a unit of silver commands labour. But from year to year silver is better, because each unit of silver will command more equally a unit of labour.

<!--  root cause of the problem with economic value is the arbitrariness of the assignment of value due to the invention of paper bank notes and stock certificates.

This can be seen in:
- checks that have no money
- stock corporations that have wrong valuation 
- financial statements with cooked books

Even if money is avoided and metals are used, not all societies have gold and silver for facilitating transactions.  -->

<!-- It will not be a store of value that everyone can relate to.  -->

This is why Supereconomics uses the common food as the store of value. 
- In most cases, these will be grains such as rice or wheat.  
- In barren places that have little agriculture such as Greenland and Alaska, these are in fish or wild game.

The important thing that they should be prevalent and known by all, as to be the common measure of economic valuation.


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1 Chapter 11" >}}
In every state of society and every stage of improvement, equal amounts of wheat will, more nearly represent equal amounts of labour than equal amounts of any rude produce.

In all the different stages of wealth and improvement, wheat is a more accurate measure of value than any other commodity.

In all those different stages, we can judge the real value of silver by comparing it with wheat than any other commodity.

This concept is the foundation of the grain index which will be used for: 
- Net Domestic Product
- Zero Inflation Goal 


## Grain-Based Valuation

Supereconomics uses grains as the store of value in order to cure the problems associated with money.

- Money is controlled by either the central bank (wholesaler) and commercial banks (retailer) 
- Grains are controlled by the people by growing or storing their own grains

All ancient governments made grain farming, logistics, and storage as their top priority. 

Those who failed in this either failed or needed a policy of conquest to keep on raiding the grains of other countries. This made their civilization short-lived and consequently, their culture became insignificant relative to those who could last long.


Adam Smith explained grain-based valuation as real value that is based on wheat, as opposed to nominal value which is based on money as coins:

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 5" >}}
The real value of a wheat is more stable from century to century than from year to year, compared to metal money.

It is useful to have real and nominal prices for long term leases. But it is not useful in common transactions. **At the same time and place, the real and the nominal price of all commodities are exactly in proportion to each other.** 

Only at the same time and place is money the exact measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities. At distant places, real and nominal prices will have differences. **The merchant considers only the nominal or money price.**
{{< /q >}}


We can say that wheat kept the subjectivity of prices, while coins made them objective. This is because the volume of wheat can change rapidly, whereas metals are more persistent. 

But the advantage of persistence of metals is counteracted by the lack of freedom and circulation that happens from hoarding it. 
- In contrast, grains cannot be hoarded for so long as they rot. This makes grain-based valuation more dynamic and flexible. 


## How it Works

Assume that 1 kilo of rice is $1. 

Adam want to buy bread from Bob. 

The bread is work $1 a piece.

This creates a relation:

```
1 kilo of rice : $1 : 1 piece of bread  
```

Since 1 point is 1 kilo of rice, then the bread is worth 1 point. 

If Adam doesn't have $1, he can give to Bob anything that Bob wants that is also worth 1 point. 

In this way, both people can get what they want, without having to employ and bankers, financiers, or lawyers. 

The most important ingredient in the transaction is their mutual agreement.
