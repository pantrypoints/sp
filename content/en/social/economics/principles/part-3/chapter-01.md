<!-- The market price is the nominal price that is applied on all customers for some time, from the customer's perspective.  -->

## The Natural Price

 <!-- the lowest common real price from all sellers over time, from the seller's perspective.  -->

The **natural price** is the average value that the producer can actually sell his goods or services with ordinary profits

This assumes that:
- the three prior laws were observed 
- there is a sense of community instead of excessive ego that leads to profit maximization

The natural price is established by the Third Law of Value which says that **there must be balance in any economy**, whether it be a family, company, or nation. This mirrors the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics that has the concept of thermal equilibrium.

We simplify this as "there must be balance in the creation and spread of value". This is easily seen in cases where there is no balance, such as in stress, burnout, economic boom and bust, inequality, excess capacity, etc.


> There must be balance in the creation and spread of value.

This concept does not exist in Economics because profit maximization prevents it. This is why modern economic systems have recurring crashes as a result of the violation of this natural law of value. Supereconomic systems are crash-resistant because they know that there exists a natural price and so the system is designed to stay near it. 

- In Bio Superphysics, this manifests as the balance between things that affect our health to maintain an equilibrium as good health.
- In Supersociology, this is balance of giving value to all classes of society in order to maintain stability and prevent revolutions.


In our cake example, let us assume that Mr. Chef's labor at ordinary profits is $2 and his ingredients and inputs vary daily from $1 to $3, and he sold the cake at $4:

Day | Real Price (Cost)| Market Price (Selling Price)
--- | --- | ---
Monday | $5 | $4
Tuesday | $4 | $4
Wednesday | $4 | $4
Thursday | $3 | $4
Friday | $4 | $4

The Natural Price would be $4, representing the most frequent and low real price, assuming that profit maximization was not observed.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The natural price is the lowest..he is likely to sell them for any considerable time.. [It is]..the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating... 
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The market price..is regulated by the proportion between the quantity..actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price.

<!-- ![4](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/4.png) -->

In Supereconomics, the balance between market and natural prices is checked through a grain index which compares the prices of commodities relative to the common grain eaten by the people. 

Even without a grain index, people will naturally feel the imbalance in the economy and start to protest if the increase in market prices no longer keep their ratio to the natural prices. Such an unnatural increase would occur if there were:

- excessive primary arbitrage as monopoly of production, or
- excessive secondary arbitrage as monopoly of distribution.  
<!-- distribution or retail of the produced goods and services were stifled by excessive secondary arbitrage.   -->

Modern Economics has no concept of natural price and so there are often wild fluctuations in prices in modern economic systems which allow maximum profits, but also losses.
 

<!-- ## The Resulting Concepts from the Fourth Law

The resulting concepts from the Fourth Law of Value are:

- Natural Price
- Socio-economic Balance as Demand-Capital-Industry-Trade ratios
- The militant class (as a ruling government) to ensure this balance -->
