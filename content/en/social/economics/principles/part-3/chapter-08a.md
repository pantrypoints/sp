Chapter 1 explained the concept of Svadharma which is being aligned to one's own *dharma*. 

We define dharma as the inherent, metaphysical nature of any discrete identity with reference to the creator of that identity.

For example, the nature of a basketball is very different from that of a smartphone.
- You can throw a ball around
- But you have to take care of your phone

{{< i s="/photos/objects/ball.jpg" a="Ball" >}}

If you treat your phone like a basketball then it will break. Likewise, if you are so careful with a basketball, then it becomes useless.

The breaking and uselessness are bad *karma* arising from not keeping with their dharma. 


## Economic Karma

Likewise, an economy has a dharma or true nature just like everything else. 

This dharma is to provide for the physical well being of everyone through effort and work, including plants and animals.

The 4 Laws then help keep up that dharma. Violation of those Laws, as *adharma*, will lead to economic crises and problems. 

Both dharma and the discovery of those laws are an effect of the Positive Force, as Yang in Taoism or Shiva in Hinduism. 

Violations of dharma and of those laws are caused by the Negative Force, as Yin in Taoism or Shakti in Hinduism. This pushes identities towards selfishness and matter, just as the Positive Force pushes towards selflessness and spirit.

An example of a Negative push is from the mind of John Stuart Mill who equated happiness to physical or material pleasure. 

{{< q a="John Stuart Mill" c="Utilitarianism" >}}
The doctrine that the basis of morals is utility, or the greatest happiness principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong in proportion as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. 

By ‘happiness’ is meant pleasure and the absence of pain; by ‘unhappiness’ is meant pain and the lack of pleasure.
{{< /q >}}


This materialism is mirrored by Marx who made the Positive (spirit) subservient to the Negative (matter):

{{< q a="Karl Marx" c="Communist Manifesto" >}}
Man’s consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence. The history of ideas prove that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed.

The first step in the revolution is to make the proletariat the ruling class. They will then wrest all capital from the capitalists and centralise all production
{{< /q >}}


This is why both Laissez-Faire Capitalism and Communism are unsustainable.
- Capitalism only creates physical well-being for the rich
- Communism only creates physical well-being for the ruling class 

Both schools of thought wanted physical well-being. But they only knew physics and not metaphysics which is the cause of everything in the physical domain. 

They dealt with effects without addressing the root cause of their economic problems. This then led to new problems. The more radical their solution the more radical the problem became, as a natural karma. 

This makes the policy fall short of its goals or even makes the problem worse. 


<!-- Smith was one of the few Western intellectuals to hint at the concept of dharma, or the natural and sustainable activities of humans, and apply it both for moral and economic purporses.

Instead of the word dharma, however, he named his concept the invisible hand. This had economic applications in The Wealth of Nations and moral applications in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

### Weaponizing the Invisible Hand

The main difference between Smith’s invisible hand and Eastern dharma is that the former has moral, spiritual, and practical uses, while the latter emphasizes only its moral and spiritual use. -->

<!-- Eastern philosophers did not dare teach the practical use of dharma because they knew that it would merely lead to corruption and evil.

For example, the Chinese discovered the principles of gunpowder which the Europeans took and weaponized in order to enslave Africa, South America, and Asia and even take Hongkong. Similarly, Western physicists discovered the nuclear fission and weaponized it to drop atom bombs on Japan.

Smith and the Physiocrats discovered the principles of wealth created by knowing one's own self-interest or purpose in life or svadharma. But this was soon "weaponized" by the merchants to enrich themselves via Mercantilism and trade wars instead of enriching all humans. 

Those merchants merely brushed aside the warnings by Smith against the pursuit of utility and avarice that the principles might bring. Later economists such as John Stuart Mill and Jean Baptiste Say even built economic theories around selfishness instead of dharma or morality:


Smith's invisible hand, on the contrary, works both personally by tapping into one's conscience, or "the man within the breast", and  socially by knowing what others are interested in, through selling and market research.


## Why did later economists miss out on the invisible hand or dharma?

The first reason is because Say and Mill lived during the start and the height of the Industrial Revolution which lasted from 1760 to 1840. The increase in productivity increased the number and variety of products available for use or utility and for satisfying the senses which were not available before. Thus, utility and all its shallow and short-term benefits came to dominate the field of morality.

Another more important reason is because both dharma and the invisible hand are naturally invisible or not obvious to shallow observation. Both can only be seen by highly-penetrating and highly-evolved minds that can look far beyond the obvious. 

In Hinduism, the concept of dharma naturally leads to the concept of karma. Anything that has a self will want to act to express that self. This action is called karma. Other selves will then react to this karma to create a reaction or another karma that boomerangs on the intial actor or self. This is why in English, karma is loosely translated as "What goes around, comes around." -->


## Smith on Economic Karma

Since karma is universal and timeless, it works the same way regardless of time and location, whether in the distant past, distant future, or in a very distant place. Selfish actions always and everywhere bring about something hurtful, or opposite of what was intended, in the long-run or even short-run:

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
At first sight, the monopoly of the great commerce of America seemed to have the highest value. The dazzling splendour of the object, however, is the very quality which renders the monopoly of it hurtful..
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The regulations of each nation to secure the exclusive trade of its own colonies are frequently more hurtful to those colonies than beneficial.
{{< /q >}}

 <!-- the countries in favour of which they are established than to those against which they are established. -->

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations" >}}
The unjust oppression of the industry of other countries falls back on the heads of the oppressors. It crushes their industry more than it does that of those other countries.

The country's industry is turned away from an advantageous employment [because of the monopoly of the home market]. The value of its produce is reduced by such regulations instead of being increased according to the intention of the lawmaker

History is full of examples of narrow-minded economic policies going back to hurt the intended beneficiaries or producing opposite effects:

Bad Policy | Karma
--- | ---
US Tariffs in the 1930's were meant to protect US industries | They contributed to the Great Depression that destroyed them
1990's Credit derivatives were created to increase the wealth of investment banks | They caused their bankruptcy through the Great Recession
The Greek government borrowed massively for the Athens Olympics to make their country richer | It led to the Greek debt crisis
Trump reduced environmental rules to make the US wealthier in 2017 | Nature fought back with Covid in 2020 which locked down the US

<!-- debt crisis where massive government spending, which was thought to draw in future investors, actually plunged Greece into a crisis.  -->

<!-- Those policies were created to increase wealth rapidly, but ended up destroying it. The more people study Smith and his ideas, the better will be humanity's chances in avoiding bad economic karma from selfish motives. -->


{{< dc t="Luck vs Karma" >}}
According to Eastern Philosoophy, there is no such thing as good or bad luck. Instead, everything is based on karma or action and reaction.

If you plant good deeds, then you get good rewards and a good feeling from such rewards. If you plant bad or selfish deeds, then you get bad consequences and a bad feeling from such consequences.

The problem is that such reactions do not happen in a fixed nor predictable time period. A good action today might create a reaction that will be experienced 10 days from now, 10 years from now, or 10 lifetimes from now (since Asian philosophy believes in reincarnation).

So if you plant a good action now and experience the good effects 10 lifetimes from now, then your future self will regard it as good luck. This is because your future self will have no memory of the good deed you performed 10 lifetimes ago. Likewise, the 'bad luck' that we experience today could come from our bad actions 10 days ago, 10 years ago, or 10 lifetimes ago.

This is why Asian philosophies have certain policy suggestions:

1. **Do good deeds as much as you can and avoid doing bad.** 

According to Hindus and Buddhists, this is to deposit good karma into your existential bank account <!-- of consequences --> so you have a lot of good karma to withdraw in the future.

However, according to Superphysics, this is not 100% technically correct. Instead, the act of consistently doing good deeds makes the 'wave' of your soul attain a certain shape. This shape then will let it fit in its proper reality, just as a classical violin fits into an orchestra and not in a death-metal band or a gangsta rap group.

2. **Learn the techniques to burn karma faster, whether good or bad. **

This is akin to making your karmic bank account more liquid. In this way, bad karma doesn't occur in one go, which might overwhelm your mind. Likewise, good karma doesn't all fall on you in one package, as this might bloat your ego.  Instead, karma is taken in manageable pieces, just like a loan that gets easy payment terms.
