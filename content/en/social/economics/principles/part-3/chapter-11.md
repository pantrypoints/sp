The dominance of the Thinker Class usually leads to the following economic ideologies:

1. Shariah
2. Liberalism
3. Anarchism


<!-- Theocratic and imperial dynastic systems represent governance and political ideologies that influence economic structures through the lens of religious authority or dynastic rule. While these systems are often associated with specific forms of governance rather than purely economic ideologies, there are certain economic characteristics within theocratic and imperial dynastic rule that can be likened to particular economic ideologies or practices. Here's an exploration of economic ideologies that share similarities with **theocracy** and **imperial dynasties**:

### 1. **Theocracy**
   - **Core Ideas**: A theocracy is a form of government where religious leaders or religious institutions hold political power, and the laws of the state are based on religious doctrines. In a theocracy, religion is the central source of authority, and the economic system is often shaped by religious teachings and ethical guidelines.
   - **Economic Characteristics**:
     - **Religious Control of Resources**: The state may control or heavily regulate economic resources based on religious principles. For example, in many theocratic systems, religious institutions may own and manage land, wealth, and business enterprises, often using the proceeds to support religious activities and maintain control.
     - **Wealth Redistribution**: Religious leaders may dictate the distribution of wealth according to religious mandates, with mechanisms like tithing (donating a percentage of one's income to religious authorities) and charity (zakat in Islam, for example).
     - **Prohibition of Certain Economic Activities**: Some activities, such as lending with interest (usury), alcohol production, or certain forms of trade, may be prohibited based on religious laws.
     - **Economic Justice and Charity**: The theocratic system might emphasize economic justice, including caring for the poor and vulnerable, but often within the confines of religious frameworks.
   
   - **Similar Economic Ideologies**:
     - **Feudalism**: In medieval Europe, feudalism often had a religious component, where the Catholic Church held vast landholdings, controlled economic activities in certain regions, and was involved in wealth redistribution via tithing. Lords and vassals would often derive their economic power from religious legitimacy granted by the Church.
     - **Islamic Economics**: Islamic economies are heavily influenced by theocratic principles. In Islam, economic activities are subject to religious laws (Sharia), which prohibit practices like usury (riba) and require charitable giving (zakat). The economy is viewed as a means to fulfill religious duties and uphold social justice.
     - **Theocratic Capitalism**: In some theocratic systems, such as in certain religiously guided states or regions, a form of capitalism may coexist, where religious authorities regulate economic activities but also allow private ownership and enterprise under strict guidelines that adhere to religious laws.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Iran**: A modern example of a theocratic state where the Supreme Leader holds significant authority over both the government and economic matters, including the regulation of industries in accordance with Islamic principles.
     - **Vatican City**: A unique theocratic state governed by the Pope, where the economy is influenced by the Catholic Church’s spiritual and material authority.
     - **Medieval Catholic Europe**: The Church had a significant role in economic affairs, influencing trade, land ownership, and wealth distribution.

### 2. **Imperial Dynasties**
   - **Core Ideas**: Imperial dynasties typically refer to systems of government where a single family or ruler, often claiming divine or hereditary legitimacy, rules over an empire. These empires tend to centralize political and economic power, and the economy is often structured to benefit the imperial family and their loyal subjects, while subjugating others.
   - **Economic Characteristics**:
     - **Centralized Control**: The imperial ruler or dynasty has significant control over economic activities, such as trade, taxation, and resource distribution. The ruler often owns or has exclusive rights to major economic resources (land, precious metals, etc.).
     - **Exploitation of Conquered Territories**: Imperial systems often involve the exploitation of resources and labor from conquered territories, leading to the extraction of wealth from colonies or subject populations. This might include the use of slaves or forced labor.
     - **Tributary System**: Vassal states or conquered regions often pay tribute to the imperial center. This tribute may take the form of taxes, goods, or military service, reinforcing the economic power of the imperial family or ruling class.
     - **Monopoly on Trade**: In some imperial systems, the ruling dynasty controls trade routes and sets up monopolies over the exchange of goods, both within the empire and with foreign nations.
     - **Social Hierarchies and Labor Systems**: The economy may rely on rigid class structures, with elites and nobility benefiting from control over land and labor, while peasants or lower classes work under the authority of the ruling dynasty.

   - **Similar Economic Ideologies**:
     - **Mercantilism**: Mercantilism is an economic system that emphasizes state control of the economy to enhance national wealth, often through protectionist policies, monopolies, and colonial exploitation. Mercantilist policies were often seen in imperial systems, where the state (or the imperial ruler) controls trade and resources.
     - **Feudalism (with imperial aspects)**: In an imperial dynasty, the land and wealth were often distributed through a feudal-like system, where local lords and vassals would control land granted by the emperor or ruler in exchange for loyalty and military service. In this case, the emperor had supreme authority, but the economic structures were decentralized at the local level.
     - **Patrimonialism**: This economic system is similar to the imperial system in that power and wealth are distributed based on loyalty to the ruler or ruling family. Economic resources are often seen as personal property of the ruler, and they are distributed through patronage networks. This can be seen in the way imperial rulers might redistribute wealth to maintain loyalty and control.

   - **Examples**:
     - **Imperial China**: Dynasties such as the Qing or Ming controlled vast territories and operated under a system where the emperor had ultimate control over the economy, managing agricultural output, trade, and taxation. Imperial China also relied on a tributary system with neighboring countries.
     - **Roman Empire**: The Roman emperors centralized control of trade, tax collection, and land, using the wealth extracted from conquered territories to fund imperial expansion and maintain the luxury of the imperial court.
     - **The Ottoman Empire**: The Ottomans controlled vast swathes of land, operated a system of tribute and taxation, and utilized monopolies on certain trades (like silk and spices) while maintaining a class-based, feudal system under the sultans.

### Comparison of Theocracy and Imperial Dynasties with Other Economic Ideologies:

| **Feature/Characteristic**          | **Theocracy**                                | **Imperial Dynasties**                         |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Control over the economy**        | Religious leaders control resources and economic activities | Emperor/dynastic family controls resources and trade |
| **Property ownership**              | Often collective or religiously controlled property | The emperor or dynasty owns most land, with distribution to loyal subjects |
| **Labor system**                    | Based on religious duties (e.g., tithing, charity) | Often relies on tributary systems, forced labor, or feudal obligations |
| **Economic policies**               | Regulated by religious doctrine (e.g., Sharia, Christian doctrine) | Centralized control, exploitation of colonies, trade monopolies |
| **Wealth distribution**             | Often redistributed via religious institutions | Wealth is concentrated in the hands of the ruling family or elite |
| **Social classes**                  | Often stratified according to religious laws | Rigid hierarchical structures, with nobility and peasants |
| **Examples**                        | Iran (modern), Vatican City (modern), Medieval Catholic Europe | Ancient China, Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire |

### Conclusion:
While theocratic and imperial dynastic systems aren't typically classified as economic ideologies in the traditional sense, they have distinct economic characteristics that can be compared to other systems. **Theocracy** often emphasizes religious control and regulation, while **imperial dynasties** focus on centralized power, territorial exploitation, and economic monopolies. Both systems share characteristics of centralized economic control, hierarchical social structures, and wealth redistribution, either through religious or dynastic power structures.
