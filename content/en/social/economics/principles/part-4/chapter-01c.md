Free competition is a necessary idea under the Third Law or the law of fair exchange, and is always checked by the Fourth Law or the law of balance. 

![Third Law](/graphics/econ/law3.jpg)

Value is spread throughout society via exchange after passionate creators make their products and services. Their mutual exchange naturally creates a sort of competition on who can satisfy the demand of society better, faster, and cheaper. 

In time, the invisible hand, which also works on the demand side as the customer preferences, match both supply and demand.

### Competition as a Beauty Contest

**The freedom of each competitor needs to be guaranteed by the government.** 

For example, the competitors in a beauty contest might not be equal in height, weight, skin color, or hair length, etc. Nevertheless, their freedom to be in the competition, to wear their costumes, show their skills, answer questions, should be guaranteed by the organizers. 

{{< i s="/photos/social/contest.jpg" a="Contest">}}


This guarantee of freedom in commercial competition was removed by French economist JB Say through the concept of laissez faire from the Physiocrats which he corrupted to mean total deregulation. Because of this deregulation, some competitors were able to acquire its competitors, corner the supply, and become too-big-to-fail. 

It would be like a beauty contest where the organizers allowed some contestants answer questions longer than what is regulated. Or letting everyone have as many costumes as they want, instead of a single costume, as what is customary. This would benefit those from richer countries who could spend more for such costumes and thus bend the votes towards their favor. 

<!-- and this later corrupted the original laissez faire of the Physiocrats via misinterpretations of English economists. -->

The need for equal competitors was then created by the <!--  unnecessarily created by the --> marginal revolution because it instituted the absurd concept of profit maximization. 

<!-- It is absurd because Smith says that profits and prices from manufactures must decline naturally through time. A simple proof of this is the price of cellphones from the '90s compared to today. The only way to maximize profits would be to monopolize the cellphone manufacture, and this manifests as companies becoming bigger and more unequal. 

For example, Apple has become a huge company that bans others from copying its tech via Intellectual Property. This system makes welfare go to the top, increasing inequality, which is really just poverty taking place in a rich country. To solve this, economists teach that competitors must be equal to prevent inequality, which contradicts their teaching of profit maximization which creates the inequality in the first place. -->

Proof of this contradiction is in Marshall's Principles of Economics (the textbook that came before Samuelson's Economics)

{{< q a="Alfred Marshall" c="Principles of Economics" >}}
It is commonly said that the tendency of competition is to equalize the earnings of people engaged in the same trade<!-- or in trades of equal difficulty -->; but this statement requires to be interpreted carefully. 

For competition tends to make the earnings got by two individuals of unequal efficiency in any given time, say, a day or a year, not equal, but unequal; and, in like manner, it tends not to equalize, but to render unequal the average weekly wages in two districts in which the average standards of efficiency are unequal.

<!-- Adam Smith said that 
But if your question is about free competition (with justice integrated) instead of equal competition (with no justice): "Where does Smith say that poverty will be minimum and welfare, maximum, when competitors are free under the umbrella of justice provided by the sovereign?"  -->


Then the quotes are mostly found in Book 5

### Free Competition Lowers Taxes or Prices But Raises Revenue

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 5, Chapter 2" >}}
A big capital or credit is needed to collect taxes. These would alone restrain the competition for such an undertaking to very few people. The competition is further reduced by the knowledge or experience needed. Those few with all of these would find it for their interest to combine and be co-partners.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 5, Chapter 2, Article 2" >}}
A tax on the profits from any trade can never fall finally on the dealers. They must ordinarily have their reasonable profit. If the competition is free, he can seldom have more than that profit.
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain it, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to act according to their natural genius, they have always, in order to confine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
In almost all countries, the revenue of the sovereign is drawn from the revenue of the people. The greater the revenue of the people, the greater their annual produce, the more they can give to the sovereign. It is his interest to increase as much as possible that annual produce. 
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
It is especially the interest of one whose revenue arises chiefly from a land-rent, like that of the sovereign of Bengal. That rent must necessarily be in proportion to the quantity and value of the produce. The rent and the value of the produce must depend on the extent of the market. The quantity will always be suited exactly to the consumption of those who can pay for it. The price they pay will always be in proportion to the eagerness of their competition.

### Free Competition Increases Innovation

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The increase of demand though in the beginning it may sometimes raise the price of goods, never fails to lower it in the long run. It encourages production and increases the competition of the producers. Those producers turn to new divisions of labour and improvements never thought of in order to undersell one another.

<!-- q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The words regulation and deregulation are ambigous. Regulating a criminal away from owning a gun is a good rule. But regulating the army to avoid guns is absurd. Therefore, regulation and deregulation are always relative to the common interest.
