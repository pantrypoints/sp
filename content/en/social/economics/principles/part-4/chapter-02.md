The third division is the circulating capital. It only affords a revenue by circulating or changing masters

Circulating Capital is anything that produces value by changing owners. It has 4 parts:


1. Raw materials

Examples are the stock of food owned by the butcher, farmer, wheat-merchant, brewer, etc.

2. Unfinished products

Examples are clothes, furniture, and building which remain with the growers, manufacturers, drapers, timber merchants, carpenters and joiners, brick-makers, etc.

3. Finished products

These are items with the merchant or manufacturer but not yet disposed of, or distributed to the proper consumers. Examples are the finished work in the shops of the smith, cabinet-maker, goldsmith, jeweller, china-merchant, etc.

4. Money

This circulates and distributes the three other stocks to their proper consumers. This is essential in a money-based commercial system, but not necessary in a barter or Xcommerce system (to be explained in Chapter 6). 



## Money as Circulating Capital

Money as a circulating capital leads to the concept of inflation. 

### Inflation 

1. Demand-pull money-price Inflation

Here, prices rise because of excessive demand caused by money going to consumers.

2. Cost-push money-price Inflation

Here, prices rise because of increased costs caused by supply not matching the increased demand.


The USD is like training wheels for world trade. It's essential to get started with trade, but after humans learn to trade, they can get rid of it to maximize trade.
