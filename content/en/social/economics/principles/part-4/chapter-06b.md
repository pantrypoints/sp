## Business Cycle

### Profit Cycle

Figure 1. The Money Cycle by the people who live by profits (purple), the Budget Deficit Cycle by the people who live by rent [taxes] (blue), and the Poverty Cycle by the people who live by wages (red).

The Selfish-interest and Monetary dogmas create a money cycle (above, in purple) that eventually destroys the nominal value that is in excess of what is needed by industry, or even all of the nominal value that the cycle created—as evidenced in bubbles, crashes, crunches, and recessions. 

It also creates a poverty cycle (in red) that creates negative value as debt and manifests as inequality or the gap between the rich and the poor.

Lastly, it creates a budget deficit cycle (in blue) for the government, which explains the always-growing debt of most countries that adopt the current economic theory. 

As the lifeblood of Capitalism is this money cycle, it will self-destruct just like a Ponzi scheme or an Enron scenario:

1946 – (Bar 1) Bretton Woods marks the beginning of its own demise by making the US dollar an international reserve currency, violating Adam Smith’s rule to isolate money.

1979 – (Bar 2) After 26 years, Bretton Woods proves unsustainable and is ended by the Nixon Shock—Nixon ended it abruptly to protect America’s economic interests—proving Adam Smith correct. The lack of a gold standard leads to inflation for most of the 1970's.

1998 – (Bar 3) After 27 years since the Nixon Shock, the floodgates of overtrading are opened with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, through the lobbying of Citigroup which wanted to be a “superbank” (PBS, 2003), violating Adam Smith’s rule to have small banks. They create new nominal value vehicles called CDOs to be traded.

2007 – (Bar 4) Within ten years of the repeal of Glass-Steagall, a huge credit crunch creates a global recession—as banks, very quickly, as expected, protect their own interests—eventually forcing governments to bail them out and print more money in order to increase trade. By now, the weakness of the temporary patch I called the “Keynesian countermeasures” in fighting selfish-interests is glaringly apparent, proving Adam Smith correct again.

2012 – (5) Five years later, the US federal government faces a “fiscal cliff” and the Eurozone is in crisis. Global gold prices and social inequality reach record levels as most of the global value is only nominal, and real value is unable to meet effectual demand. Soon, the gap between demand and real value will be unsustainable, leading to a global crash of trade courtesy of the selfish hand, as people are expected to protect their own selfish interests.
