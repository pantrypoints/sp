Capitalism is a mutation of the mercantile system mentioned in the previous subchapter.

In order to create the mercantile companies to rake in precious metals from foreign trade, stock certificates were invented. 

These could then be traded. This allowed outside people (the non founders) to own the work of the people in the company.

This is why we define Capitalism as **an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits**.


In Book 5 of *The Wealth of Nations*, corporations or firms were known as joint stock companies which were big business organizations that ran on the same basic ideas:

Joint stock company (Book 5, Chap. 1) | Corporation or firm
--- | ---
Trade on a joint stock, on a large capital | Trade on a common or preferred stock representing a large capital
Each member shares in the common profit or loss in proportion to his share | Stockholder's liability is limited to his stock investment
Members can transfer shares, introduce new members without the company’s consent | People can buy and transfer shares of publicly listed companies
The value of a share is always its market price and is different from the stated value | Stock price can be different from the IPO price or par value
The joint stock company is always managed by a court of directors | The corporation is managed by executives under a CEO
The court of directors is under a court of proprietors who do not understand the company's business | The CEO is managed by a board of directors from various backgrounds


It is through the ownership of stock by people outside or unrelated to the company's operations that they get rich through the accumulation of profits via:
- retained earnings 
- rising stock prices. 

By simply making the right bet, a stock trader or investor can multiply his small money into big money without doing much work, just like a gambler.

This is one of the main expedients that fuels inequality, as it allows people to feed off the work of others legally. 

When left unchecked, it allows people to increase their nominal value way above their real value. This manifests as bubbles which pop when the nominal value crashes back to its real, natural value.

### State Capitalism, Inclusive Capitalism

State capitalism is the state trying to solve the problem of inequality by giving the government the control of private equity so that its profits can be better distributed to society. 

However, such a system requires its government administrators to have a high degree of skill and morals to juggle private and public interest at the same time. 

Adam Smith says that the government can be in business as long as its people are responsible. This is proven by the success of China's state-owned corporations:

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 5, Chapter 2" >}}
Government management of mercantile projects like this requires orderly, vigilant, and parsimonious administration, like those in Venice and Amsterdam. But the government of England was never famous for good economy. In peacetime, she has been slothful and negligently profuse. This is perhaps natural to monarchies.

A well-run state capitalism* leads to less opportunities for private capitalism. This is why liberals say that governments have no business to be in business. They cherry-pick quotes from the Wealth of Nations to advocate deregulation and laissez faire, contrary to the original spirit of the book.


From here we can add other definitions:

- **Inclusive capitalism** is an economic system that uses outside ownership to let everyone amass private profits, likely through penny stocks or group purchase
- **Stakeholder capitalism** is an economic system that uses outside ownership to let its stakeholders have a share in the profits of the company or system
<!-- - Shareholder capitalism is wrong because it is redundant -->


### Capitalist Versus Businessman

Our definition distinguishes capitalism from mercantilism and can distinguish the capitalist from the non-capitalist:

Capitalist | Not Capitalist
--- | ---
A long-term investor who uses his money to buy and hold stocks in a company that sells products profitably | A baker who employs his own assistants and bakes his own bread for profit
A company, owned by 'silent' partners, that is unable to make any profits or just breaks even for a long time | A corporation that makes profits but gives it all back to society
A holding company or shell company that produces nothing | A day trader who uses his own money to buy stocks or commodities in the morning and sell it in the afternoon for profit is a merchant or speculator, not a capitalist
A government that creates a government-corporation by inviting private equity | A government that creates a government-company by issuing bonds


By defining capitalism, we can better filter out the economic policies that enslave people and we can adopt those that set them free. 


## Capitalism: Born Between 1800-1830 

<!-- Let's compare our definition with the historical definition:  -->

Capitalism's birth in England and/or France can be narrowed down to after Smith's death in 1790 to before 1830 when its idea was already written about, as explained by Marx:

{{< q a="Karl Marx" c="Capital, Preface" >}}
Gustav von Gülich in his "Historical description of Commerce, Industry,"..in 1830, has examined at length the historical circumstances that prevented, in Germany, the development of the capitalist mode of production.. Thus the soil whence Political Economy springs was wanting. This "science" had to be imported from England and Franceas a ready-made article.. Since 1848 capitalist production has developed rapidly in Germany, and at the present time it is in the full bloom of speculation and swindling.

There were capitalist corporations, such as the South Sea Company, before the 1800s. But they were not so prevalent in  industry which were still dominated by guilds in the 18th century. 

The steam engine changed things because they allowed non-specialist workers to produce what the specialized guilds were manufacturing by hand.  

Capitalism failed to take root in Germany and most other places, but took root in Britain because of:
- the high degree of freedom that the British enjoyed
- the strong support by their government.

The Netherlands and the Hanseatic league had weaker government support. This prevented their mercantilism from evolving into capitalism, allowing the British to take over the world. 

In fact, Thomas Mun wrote that the Dutch owed their commercial wealth to the British who empowered them to counteract the strength of Spain:


{{< q a="Thomas Mun" c="England's Treasure on Foreign Trade" >}}
The Dutch Author of Mare Liberum cannot entitle the Dutch to fish in His Majesty's Seas.. But I am not saying that the Dutch should not be allowed to catch and carry them away from there without His Majesties licence. The fishing rights might be a good policy to keep them in league with England and in war against Spain.

From Britain, the seed ideas of modern capitalism went to France, as seen in JB Say, a French businessman and proto-capitalist, who wrote *A Treatise on Political Economy (1803)*. 


However, the single idea that sparked the growth of those seed ideas was James Mill who, in *Elements of Political Economy (1821)*, defined a capitalist as someone who owns the produce of the work of others, without actually working himself :

{{< q a="John Stuart Mill" c="Chapter 1, Section 2">}}
In this sense of the term "owners of labour," the parties, concerned about production, are divided into two classes, that ofcapitalists, the rich men who supply the materials and instruments of production; and that of the workmen, who supply the labour.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- img src="https://socioecons.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jmillj.jpg" alt="James Mill" cap="James Mill (1773-1836), creator of modern capitalism, was a friend of Jeremy Bentham, a liberal" -->


Note that in this sense,capitalist can only apply if the workers are **ACTUALLY SLAVES**:

{{< q a="John Stuart Mill" c="Elements of Political Economy Chapter 1, section 2, emphasis added" >}}
The labourer, who receives wages, sells his labour for a day.. The manufacturer, who pays these wages, buys the labour for the day..He is equally therefore the owner of the labour, with the manufacturer who operates with slaves.. the capitalist is the owner of both instruments of production: and the whole of the produce is his.

<!-- Capitalism emphasizes **private ownership of property** and the means of production, with minimal state intervention. It relies on the profit motive, competition, and free markets to allocate resources and generate wealth.

Economic Characteristics**: Market-driven economy, minimal regulation, and wealth accumulation through individual and corporate entrepreneurship.

Examples**: Modern capitalist economies, especially in countries like the USA, UK, and most Western nations. -->
