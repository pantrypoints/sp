<!-- In Supereconomics, we achieve this by setting its base valuation to the common grain of the country that it is measuring
 — describes the AI as something that 

  existing thought-processing of whatever the Impartial Spectator's socio-political-economic goal is, whether it be price prediction, capital flows prediction, election prediction, legislation prediction, population demographic prediction, disease prediction, etc.
 — describes the centralization of the functionalities of the AI as a single cohesive unit, manifesting as socio-economic singularity. Nowadays, these functionalities are called 'skills' as Alexa Skills or 'actions' as Google Actions. -->


Supereconomics (Economic Superphysics) aims to solve all economic problems by adding moneyless donations and exchange (barter), as points-based valuation, to the current money-based valuation. This is similar to how Material Superphysics aims to solve mysteries in Physics by adding the aether-idea onto the idea of "quantum fields". 

The points-based valuation represents [the effort theory of value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b) which we derived from Adam Smith:


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations Simplified, Book 1, Chapter 5" >}}
Labour..is the only universal, as well as the only accurate measure of value.. by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all places.. From century to century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from century to century, equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity of labour more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year to year, on the contrary, silver is a better measure than corn, because equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of labour.

In this system, the price of goods can be determined using the quantity of other goods. For example, an iPhone X has a money-price of $1,000 which is double the money-price of a Huawei P20 at $500. So in our system, an iPhone X is worth 2 Huawei P20. If 1 kilo of rice is $1, then an iPhone X is worth 1,000 kilos of rice:

- 1 iPhoneX : 2 Huawei P20
- 1 iPhoneX : 1000 kilos of rice

As you can see, our system liberates the economy from being bound only to money, making it a true free trade system by allowing iPhones to be valued in Huawei phones, rice, or whatever. This is similar to how the Big Mac index pegs currencies to the Big Mac, except that we peg Big Macs to rice so that economies can function without money. 


## Based on Ratios, Not Equalities

Instead of equilibrium or the equals sign, this system is based on **ratios** or the ratio sign. This is in line with our proposed [Qualimath](/qualimath/)

This is useful for poor people and even for corporations during financial crises where money is tight or unavailable. In addition, it will lower the cost of buying and selling since it will use the already-existing telecoms system, instead of the financial system with its expensive bankers and financiers*.


{{< n n="*In Supereconomics, such people will still be employed to do inspection, 'KYC', and credit checks." >}}
 

An advanced economy can be very complex because of the huge number of goods and commodities for sale. It would be impossible to keep track of all the ratios manually. This is why the system needs machine learning, more popularly called artificial intelligence or AI, which we call ANI as Automated Natural Intelligence. 

The most useful result that Supereconomics aims to get is **the real price of everything**, which is the value of everything relative to grains. In this way, all prices become natural which then removes the chance for crises from emerging. 


In order to arrive at the real price, the ANI has to filter out the bias and the noise in the data. We can say that the ANI has to be an impartial spectator of the flow of data that is routed to it.

Thus, we come up with ISAIAH as the name of our ANI:

- IS means impartial spectator
- AI means automated intelligence
- AH means aggregation hub

The idea is inspired by the prophet Isaiah who made many predictions about events in the Middle East. Likewise, ANI is designed to make predictions about anything that it is evidenced by real data.

## Other Implementations

ISAIAH, as a machine learning hub, can interpret data from non-economic sciences such as medicine and politics, using the other branches of Superphysics:


_ | Superphysics paradigm | End Goal

Economic data | Supereconomics | Real Prices, [Clearing Fund Rates](/research/schumacher/pool-clearing/part-1)
Health data |  [Bio Superphysics](/medical) | Disease prediction
Historical data | [Supersociology](/social/supersociology) | Social and political predictions
