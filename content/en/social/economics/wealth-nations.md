The Wealth of Nations was part two of a three-part series that aimed to create a comprehensive system that would create a happy and prosperous global human society. 

“It might have been expected that the reasonings of lawyers on the imperfections of the laws of different countries, should have created an inquiry into the natural rules of justice independent of all positive institution, and led the lawyers to establish a system of natural jurisprudence, or a theory of the general principles. This system or theory would run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations.”

Part 1 was the moral system that served as the foundation for the whole system which is based on fellow-feeling and not selfishness
Part 2 was the socio-economic system that produced necessities and luxuries and was based on self-purpose instead of money or utility
Part 3 was the justice system that solved disputes and ensured fairness 

“In the last paragraph of the first Edition of the present work, I said, that I should in another discourse endeavour to give an account of the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions which they had undergone in the different ages and periods of society; not only in what concerns justice, but in what concerns police, revenue, and arms, and whatever else is the object of law. In the Enquiry concerning the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, I have partly executed this promise; at least so far as concerns police, revenue, and arms. What remains, the theory of jurisprudence, which I have long projected, I have hitherto been hindered from executing, by the same occupations which had till now prevented me from revising the present work.”

Part 1 was the moral system that served as the foundation for the whole system which is based on fellow-feeling and not selfishness. This was done through The Theory of Moral Sentiments

Part 2 was the socio-economic system that produced necessities and luxuries and was based on self-purpose instead of money or utility. This was done through The Wealth of Nations.

Part 3 was the justice system that solved disputes and ensured fairness. This was not done. 

“In the last paragraph of the first Edition of the present work, I said, that I should in another discourse endeavour to give an account of the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions which they had undergone in the different ages and periods of society; not only in what concerns justice, but in what concerns police, revenue, and arms, and whatever else is the object of law.
