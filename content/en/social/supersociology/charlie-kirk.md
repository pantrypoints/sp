Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old American conservative activist, was fatally shot during a public event at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025 by 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.

## Karma Enforced

We are not surprised by this as it is natural karma. 

Charlie Kirk pushed for gun ownership even during a time of mass shootings in his own country. He fully knew it was impossible to avoid gun deaths with an armed citizenry but believed the benefits outweighed the costs.

He got a taste of his own medicine. There is nothing mysterious or profound about this. 

What is alarming is the current ignorance about karma's dynamics—people are unable to connect Charlie's gun advocacy with his gun death. Such connections are commonly seen in criminal gangs dying by violence and corrupt officials being caught and imprisoned.

## Kirk's Contradiction

We are interested in root causes, not effects, so we dissect the fatal flaws in Kirk's positions, which we distill as confusing theocracy with libertarianism:
- Theocracy is from him being Christian
- Libertarianism is from him being American

These two are fundamentally opposed.

In a theocratic system, the church controls all aspects of society:
- The church has a monopoly on legitimate violence
- Enforcement is absolute and uncompromising

The church imposes order by burning people at the stake, just as Iran's clerics arbitrarily jail dissidents. In this system, there is no need for gun ownership since the state controls all.


## The French Revolution Brings Libertarianism

The big change in the West happened with the French Revolution, which separated church and state, naturally leading to libertarianism.

Religious authority lost its monopoly on moral legitimacy -- individual rights became paramount.

This led to gun ownership for self-defense, which is why gun ownership is a core principle in the US Constitution as the US was created just before the French Revolution.

The same philosophical principle scales up. In a liberalized world, people arm themselves against each other just as nations do.
- Nations arm themselves with nuclear weapons so other nations cannot attack them under the principle of mutually assured destruction.


## The Instability Problem and the Proper Solution

But this system is inherently fragile:
- Gun prevalence leads to mass shootings
- Nuclear prevalence leads to the fears of nuclear annihilation and proxy wars (since superpowers cannot fight each other directly)
<!-- - Instead of regional wars ending fast such as the world wars ending after 4-6 years, they get drawn out like Afghanistan's which  -->
- No absolute authority can impose order—this explains the UN's weakness

These lead to the current violent world.

Our solution is first to classify philosophies and political positions using:
- the philosophy matrix
- social cycles

This will prevent contradictions.

Then we use the principles of Supersociology to suggest policies based on the proponent's goals.

For example, Charlie Kirk pushed for guns as a means of defense against abuse and crime.

But crime has various causes. So we distill crimes into property and non-property crimes based on incidence, not seriousness.

This is because seriousness is subjective. For example, a CEO's murder might be regarded as more serious than a homeless person's murder. But metaphysically, both murders show negative action from a soul. 

The prevalence of negative action in society is what we are interested in.

| Rank | Crime Type                         | Approximate Annual Incidents (2023) | Notes |
|------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| 1    | Larceny-Theft (Property)                  | ~4.5 million                        | By far the most common crime; includes shoplifting, pickpocketing, theft from vehicles, etc. |
| 2    | Aggravated Assault (Non-Property)         | ~800,000–900,000                    | Most common violent crime; represents ~68% of all violent crimes |
| 3    | Burglary (Property)         | ~840,000                            | Breaking and entering into buildings |
| 4    | Motor Vehicle Theft (Property) | ~700,000–800,000                    | Has been increasing recently (2023–2024) |
| 5    | Robbery (Property) | ~250,000–300,000                    | Taking property by force or threat of force |
| 6    | Rape / Sexual Assault (Non-Property)            | ~100,000–140,000                    | Significantly underreported |
| 7    | Murder / Non-negligent Manslaughter (Non-Property) | ~18,000–19,000                   | Least common of major crimes but most serious |

As you can see, property crimes make up most criminal activity in the USA.

Such crimes come from the flawed materialist economic system where people chase objects instead of each other. And so people hurt and kill each other for those objects.

Gun ownership tries to prevent harm by returning harm—fighting fire with fire. It does not strike at the root cause at all.
- This is why there are studies that link crime and even mass shootings with low GDP. 

Our solution to property crime is a moneyless system that focuses on relations between people instead of objects. This is based on Cartesian Relationality, which is in turn based on Existence being one Entity.


## Tweaking Kirk

The proper advocacy for Kirk's selfish goals of a materialist, liberal, anti-Islamic USA would be:
- Push for Christian values like peace and the Golden Rule
- Limit private gun ownership to historically nonviolent religious groups: Christians, Taoists, Hindus, and Buddhists

This would put Muslims* at a disadvantage and deter them from moving to the US.

*Conversely, Muslims can use Social Sueprphysics to create solutions against American materialism that are better than flying aircraft into American buildings:
- The greed for oil can be countered by free energy as envisioned by Nikola Tesla from vacuum energy
- The dominance of American finance can be thwarted by moneyless credit sytems that are in line with the Quran as explained in Sura 2:282
  - The expansion to world trade will reduce the importance of global finance, since cross border investments can also be done moneylessly

However, since Social Superphysics' goal is global unity, the correct dharmic policy for the US and all countries is:
- Adopt a moneyless, non-materialist economic system that focuses on people. This prevents property crimes by accounting the available resources
- Teach people the metaphysics of life, karma, and psychology
- Teach the military and police the metaphysics of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti), criminal behavior, and selfishness
- Teach the government how to prevent the Negative Force's growth by growing the Positive
  - These prevent non-property crimes.
