### Article 1: The Feelings

All actions come from feelings. 



### Article 2: Virtues

A virtue is a combination of specific feelings which aim at positive results, agreeable to humans in general. 


### Article 3: Detestable Vices

Vices are the opposite of virtue. Detestable vices are those that are abhorrent to the general human feelings. Examples are:

- mass murder and genocide
- mutilation and violent rape

Humans who carry such feelings with the intention of realizing them are to be called "inhumane". 


### Article 4: Eradicating Detestable Vices

We will aim to eradicate such feelings and detestable vices from having a chance of breeding in human minds and hearts through a comprehensive approach tapping into morals, traditions, religions, systems, laws, and policies.
