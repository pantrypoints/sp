### Article 5: Condition

These human rights are not available to the inhumane which will have the non-human rights instead.


### Article 6: Unity and Society

All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights within a society, predisposed to unity.

The existence of human society is a manifestation of this predisposition. These unified human rights, therefore, can only exist within a structure of a society. 


### Article 7: Ego and Human Limitation

The ego, as the feeling of the self, causes disunity and all the problems in society. It hampers fellow-feeling and the development of virtue. 

Related to the ego are human sensory limitations. These lead to variations in culture, language, religion, ideologies, and mentalities. <!--  or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.  -->

### Article 8: No Slavery or Arbitrary Detention

The ego leads to the slavery and arbitrary arrest, detention or exile of others. Thus, we guarantee that every human has the right to life, liberty and security of person. 

<!-- Slavery is prohibited, whether in physical or mental spheres.

No one shall be subjected to . -->
