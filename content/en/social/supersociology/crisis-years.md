In 2015, we made a model that predicted [the Crisis Years](/social/supersociology/precrisis-years/) which were to begin in 2019, being felt from 2020 up to around 2035.

This model was created by plotting the historical events in Europe from the mercantilist period. We used the wheat prices from Adam Smith and extended them to current times.

 <!-- and David Hume who were Scottish historians.  -->

It matched the major European wars such as the Seven Years War and the World Wars, as well as the major European economic crises such as:
- the 18th century stock bubbles 
- the financial crises from 1920 to 2008

These exposed the hidden dynamics of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti-Maya in Taoism and Hinduism) lurking in the Western psyche. 

These dynamics pointed to a pattern of stagflation, to be followed by a series of conflicts that may merge into a bigger war that would affect the West. This is because the events are effects of the Western mental wavelength or mentality. 

Unlike particles that exist in isolation, waves are continuous and connected with other waves.

### Trump as the Crisis Causer

Back in 2015, we were wondering how could the crisis become so huge when there was no carrier for the Negative Force.

The world no longer had an evil Hitler or Stalin.
- The Kim family was evil but North Korea is not advanced as Nazi Germany, nor does it have the population or resources of the Soviets. 
- Xi Jinping might act imperial, but he is still not crazy ambitious like Hitler nor violent like Stalin.  

Then Trump became the Republican candidate in May 2016 fulfilling the requirement for a Crisis Causer. 
- He is ambitious as Hitler and is loved by Neo Nazis
- He is possibly as violent as Stalin by threatening North Korea with fire and fury

Moreover, the United States is both advanced like Nazi Germany and has resources like the Soviet Union.

Our model revealed that the US in 2016 was in a Warrior Cycle. It classified Hillary Clinton as Warrior and Trump as Trader, and therefore Clinton should win the popular vote. This actually happened. 

However, the US does not follow the popular vote system and so Trump won the presidency through the electoral system. 


### The Trump Term and Covid: The War with Nature

Just like any Negative Trader, Trump wants maximum gain and riches at the expense of others. 


{{< i s="/photos/countries/us/trump.jpg" a="Trump MAGA" >}}


<!-- Trump's legacy has been Covid, Trade War, and the loss of Afghanistan.  -->
During his 1st term, he starts a trade war which cut off China from US corn and soybeans. So China gets them from Brazil via Bolsonaro who destroys the Amazon. 

Nature fights back by bringing in Covid as karma. This shuts down the US economy, gives Trump and Bolsonaro Covid, and prevents their reelection with Biden and Lula replacing them. 

In May 2021, Lula announced his intention to run against Bolsonaro, with a plan to end the deforestation of the Amazon. Nature complies and 6 months later Covid is reduced to Omicron allowing lockdowns to be removed. 

Unlike the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza wars which have hundreds of thousands dead, the war with Nature has **millions** dead via disease and global warming disasters.
- Covid alone has killed 7 million people.


### The Curse of Finance

To solve the economic decline from Covid, Biden stupidly gives money out*, causing a crypto bubble and chronic inflation to last for many years. 

{{< n n="This is still a relic of the Mercantile thinking that money as wealth. This is why the West imposed financial sanctions on Russia thinking that it would cause Putin to back down" >}}

The proper solution during the 2020 downturn was for the government to facilitate relief distributions of food and essentials to those who lost their jobs. 
- This would improve the national relief system which could be used for the increasing disasters caused by global warming.
- This solution would improve the food production and distribution systems.  

Unfortunately, the Democrats chose to use the financial system to:
- solve the downturn of 2020
- punish Russia for invading Ukraine in 2022

Both these were obviously ineffective. 

So ironically, the Americans bring back Trump in 2024 to solve the inflation that was caused by Biden who tried to solve the decline that was caused by Trump trying to make America Great Again. 

> The inflation was caused by Biden trying to solve the decline caused by Trump trying to Make America Great Again


Trump tried to make America great again by defeating Nature, China, and the Shia (Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iran) by allying with polluters such as the Sunni (Saudi, Qatar, UAE) and with finance (Israel). 

This gives Trump 3 vectors in terms of impact:

1. Nature (Saudi, Qatar, UAE)
2. Rivals (China, North Korea)
3. Finance (Israel)


### The Crisis Height

He will likely double down on these vectors:
- He will squeeze China, prompting it to fight back, just as the US squeezed imperial Japan, prompting it to attack Pearl Harbor to get out of the squeeze
- He will weaken NATO, allowing Russia and Wagner to win more countries
- Since North Korea became more allied with Russia thanks to Biden, this will trigger a conflict with North Korea since the Kim family is a mini Crisis Causer 

This will culminate in a war that will involve the USA towards the end of Trump's term just as Covid began near the end of 2019. War is Nature's way of rebooting societies that have no dharma (Positive Force) and so have been infested with the Negative Force. 


{{< i s="/graphics/econ/piketty.jpg" a="World War" >}}

This is consistent with:
- The Seven Years War curing the problems with the Hapsburgs  
- World War 1 curing the problems with the late 19th century industrialization (Carnegie, Morgan)
- World War 2 curing the problems from the 1930s Depression
 <!-- caused by the Roaring 20s (Wall Street) -->


Those wars were justified by the leaders of the weakening power wanting to be great again against the rising power:
- The Hapsburgs wanted to be great again and so did a Seven Years War under France against the British
- The Germans, via the Kaiser and Hitler, wanted to be great again like Bismarck and so did 2 world wars against the British

{{< i s="/photos/medieval/hitler.jpg" a="Adolf Hitler" c="Hitler's whole propaganda was about making Germany great again" >}}



### The Crisis Aftermath: The Union of America

The future war involving the US will certainly solve the inflation by destroying the economy and starting it from scratch. 
- This will generate employment and will increase production like the 1960's and 70's after World War 2. 

Since the future war is totally avoidable, the Americans will want a separation from those who wanted that war (those who wanted to be so great).

- The worst case scenario is that US splits into 2, just as it was split between Union and Confederates. 
- The best case scenario is a break up of the federal union into smaller independent states just like Europe. These then form an American Union wherein states are free to join or exit depending on the policies adopted by the Union.

This Union can allow Mexico and Canada to enter, giving it more features than what the previous United States had.


### Explanation for the Failed 2024 Prediction

Our model put the US in a Warrior Cycle which explained the popular vote win of Clinton and Biden (since Biden is pro-Cold War). 

Harris is either a Worker or Thinker, just as Trump is a Trader. 

Since none of them are Warriors, then Trump would win because he is male and is seen as being stronger. 

However, we assumed that Harris was a **Thinker** because of her anti-abortion and environmental stand. 

Thinkers beat Warriors. And so we predicted a minor Harris win (not by landslide) since the US still has not entered the Thinker Cycle that comes after the Warrior Cycle. 

If Harris were a Worker then she would be soundly beaten by the popular vote. 

<!-- This became more obvious when her campaign focused on freedom and democracy which is a common Worker demand. -->

The results show that she was soundly beated by the popular vote. This means that Harris is a Worker, and not a Thinker. 

Therefore regarding the 2024 elections, it would have been better for the Democrats, and the world, if Hillary Clinton or any Positive Warrior, ran in 2024 instead of Harris.


### Update June 2025: Iran-Israel War

It turns out that Israel was the vector that actually started the war, even earlier than the China-Taiwan war scheduled for 2027. 

The current Israel-Iran war is in line with our original 2015 prediction that 2020 would have began as a US/Saudi vs Iran/Yemen war. The assassination of Soleimani would have sparked it and so it means that Western history was totally predictable. 

However, Covid disrupted that war with a new war against Nature. Now that Covid is gone, the original prediction is running again. 

This means that without Covid, the pattern would have been:
- Saudi-Iran 2020
- Ukraine-Russia 2023
- Taiwan-China 2027

But because there was Covid (i.e. Nature), it became:
- Ukraine-Russia 2022
- Israel-Iran 2025
- Taiwan-China 2027

Regardless, the peak crisis years would still be 2025-2030. The specifics might change, but the general pattern does not, since it is unbroken from the 13th century and theoretically even goes far back into the founding of Rome. 


### Update July 2025: Musk Fulfills the Model

{{< i s="/photos/countries/us/musk.jpg" a="Musk" >}}

The US would be entering a Thinker cycle soon, and so we were happy to see Elon Musk (an obvious Thinker) to suddenly, out of the blue, creating the American Party. 

This is totally in line with the upcoming Thinker cycle that will defeat the Warrior. 

Of course the American Party will not be an instant success. Instead, it will gather steam gradually as the US enters the Thinker cycle.
