November 1 is celebrated as the Mexican day of the dead which is mirrored in Italy and other places near the Atlantic Ocean.

The Sumerian texts explain that it was rooted in the flood around 10,800 BC organized by the Anunnaki to wipe out humans. 

This was because the early humans got fed up with Anunnaki slavery. Atlantis (called Atrahasis by the Sumerians) led the revolt since it was the most advanced civilization, as explained by Plato.

To destroy all humans, the Anunnaki leader Enlil gets a comet to crash into Atlantis in the Bahamas, which is the mother civilization of the Aztecs in Mexico.

His brother Enki wanted to save the humans so he told the Atlantean Noah to build an ark. Noah survives and becomes the start of the Middle Eastern civilizations. This is also why 25% of Mexicans have semitic DNA.  

The first project of the humans that survived was to build a tower of Babel to unite the lost humans. But this was prevented by the Anunnaki (Genesis 11).

To further prevent unity, the Anunnaki, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, create a rival spy tower that listens in on human activity. This is used by a secret police led by the Anunnaki Shamash to enforce Enlil's decrees using a large bull.

The humans tell Gilgamesh, a half-human half-Anunnaki, to destroy the tower and kill the bull. Gilgamesh succeeds and is punished by Enlil by killing his best friend Enkidu. He then goes on a quest to look for Noah to seek the truth about the Anunnaki and the Flood.

Gilgamesh is important because he led the first successful human rebel attack against the Anunnaki and possibly triggered their exit from Earth. His deeds only had 4 lines in the Old Testament as Nimrod and were not even in the Quran because both were fron Enki.


### The Awakening of Gilgamesh and the 7 Chakras

The Epic of Gilgamesh also describes how the Anunnaki upgraded Noah by touching his forehead. 

{{< q a="Noah" c="Epic of Gilgamesh Tablet 11" >}}
Enlil went up to his ship and grabbed my hand to go up with him. He made my wife go up with him by my side. He stood between us, touched our forehead and blessed us. 
{{< /q >}}

This raised his kundalini to the 6th chakra, as he described as bread:

{{< q a="Noah" c="Epic of Gilgamesh Tablet 11" >}}
Mankind	is deceptive, and will deceive you.	Come, bake loaves for him and keep setting them by his head. Draw on the wall each day that he lay down. 

The	first loaf was dessicated, the second stale, the third moist(?), the fourth	turned white, the fifth sprouted gray mold. The 6th is still fresh. The 7th ‐suddenly he touched him and the man awoke.
{{< /q >}}

Noah did this same process for Gilgamesh, giving him a new direction in life.
