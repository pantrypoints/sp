Black conservative Kaizen Asiedu has recently posted that the West abolished slavery through the British Empire.

His shallow reasoning neglects the fact that the alternative to slavery was servitude.

Servitude was used as payment for debts because the whole world naturally used labor theory of value (real productivity) instead of margunal utility (paper money).


{{< q a="Enki" c="Leviticus 25:39-43" >}}
If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves. They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents. They are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. Then they and their children are to be released.

Before the West imposed the commercial system through the colonial system, everything in the economy was either real debt or real credit. 

There were no stock valuation or gambling or usury. This is proven most obviously by Islam not allowing gambling or usury.

{{< q a="Mohammad" c="Quarn 2:275" >}}
Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury

Not all countries practiced slavery. Persia and some native tribes were known to not have slavery. 

So from a slavery perspective, Iran is the good guy, not the West. 


## The West Merely Replaced Labor Slavery with Money Slavery

The West abolished slavery simply because they went full steam ahead with paper wealth, inventing stock corporations, paper bank notes, and cash accounts, which they learned from the Jews.

Whereas Ming China learned of the evils of paper wealth and so they abolished it. 

So the British abolished traditional slavery to impose the slavery to money and businessmen as the commercial system. 

Money-slavery creates much more wealth as it is scalable and because money can be amassed, whereas traditional slaves need to be fed and housed.

However, it also enslaves Nature which is why the world is so polluted and global warming is causing so many natural disasters. 

The West merely replaced one slavery with another. 

The solution is to abolish even Western money slavery and replace it with moral servitude for those who have problems repaying debts or giving back value for the value they obtained. This is what our moneyless system is working on.
