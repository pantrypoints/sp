According to the Gospel of Judas (and Matthew 16:21), the whole plan of Jesus entering Jerusalem was to disrupt the old Jewish Law and impose his own new laws.

This would then fix the 'mistake of the stars' and bring back the order that God had originally planned. 

Initially, Jesus chooses Peter to implement this plan (Matthew 16:21). However, Peter rejects it.   

This forces Jesus to find someone else. 

Judas rises to the challenge (Judas 35). And so Jesus selects him as his best disciple and then gives instructions to betray him. 

This is to set Jesus up a showdown between him and the Pharisees with Pilate as the judge. 

The plan was for the people to vote for Jesus instead of the Pharisees' candidate who was Barabbas. This would then prove popular support which Jesus needed to revise the Jewish Law. 

Unfortunately, the people voted for Barabas, cementing the power of the Pharisees and traditional Jewish Law. 

Pilate then had no choice but to punish Jesus as a law-breaker and rebel.

The decline of Peter's leadership is evident with him denying being a disciple after Jesus was captured. This shifted the leadership to Mary Magdalene who was the wife of Jesus. This is proven by Mary being at the crucifixion and being the first person that the 'resurrected' Jesus appears to (John 20:16).

This schism between Peter and Mary is noted in the Gospel of Mary.

The negativity of the male disciples is seen in many verses where Peter refuses Jesus, Peter falls in water, Thomas doubts the 'resurrection', etc.

In the end, Peter won, with him getting assigned to Rome, the heart of the Empire, while Mary gets assigned to France which was less civilized. 

As a result, the original doctrines of Jesus handed down to Mary and Judas never survived, and all that emerged was a shallow dogma from Peter and Paul that became Roman Catholicism.

That dogma led to the dark ages in Europe until it was broken by the Reformation.
