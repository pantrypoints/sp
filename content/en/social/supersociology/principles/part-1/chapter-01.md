<!-- A society needs 3 entties. The third entity becomes the arbiter. Without the third entity, then the relationship is a partnership which is arbitrary.  -->

Modern Sociology defines a society as "a group of people who live in a defined geographic area, who interact with one another, and who share a common culture."

Our definition looks at society from a metaphysics-first perspective. We define a society as a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society either implicitly or explicitly.

- Implicit agreement is by convenience. 
- Explicit agreement is by choice. 

> Society is a metaphysical organism that is made up of individual minds


## Oversoul-Soul, Paramatman-Atman 

Our definition uses the Superphysics concept of **oversoul-soul** which is then derived from the mechanics of **compound ideas** being made up of **simple ideas** (i.e. each soul is an idea of the Supreme Entity). 

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/compound.jpg" alt="Compound ideas" >}}


This is explained by Parmenides and by Eastern Philosophy.


{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Parmenides by Plato, Chapter 2" >}}
The One itself, then, having been broken up into parts by being, is many and infinite. This means that not only the One which has being is many, but the One itself, distributed by being, must also be many.

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 1" >}}
Since the mind exists, the mental plate exists, and the reflection of Paramatman must remain. The Átman, therefore, remains associated with the jiivátman. The ultimate knowership, doership and base of existence lie in the átman.

Science views the abstract mind as coming from the physical brain.

In contrast, Supersociology views brain activity as coming from the abstract mind. This is why we instead use the word 'soul' or 'aethereal mind' to refer to a society.

In this way, a society can refer to:
- the soul of society, or
  - This the source of its culture in the abstract (e.g. why the Chinese chose chopsticks i.e. why the aethereal Chinese collective mind absorbed and assimilated the idea of using chopsticks as opposed to the rival idea of using hands or spoon and fork to eat)
- the physical society
  - This the source of its culture in the physical sense (e.g. physical Chinese using physical chopsticks)


English | Superphysics | Sanskrit
--- | --- | ---
Soul | Aethereal Mind | Jivatman
Mind | Physical Mind (Aethereal Mind connected to body) | Jivatman
Consciousness | Experiencer | Atman

In a nutshell:
- the soul, as part of the Supreme Entity, is a product of the 2 Forces (Positive and Negative, historically as Shiva or Yang, and Shakti or Yin).
- the 2 Forces fight each other and causes waves
- the waves are therefore the effect of the destabilization of the Absolute Entity which then leads to Existence and the Supreme Entity, both of which have a wave-nature
- the wave-nature creates diversity and cycles


By referring to a society as a soul, we:
- free it from physical limitations
- give it flexible qualities that are similar to sound and music
  
These flexible qualities resemble waves, which is the medium to transmit feeling-information. For example, a tune can change either gradually or immediately from melodic to rhythmic, just as a mind can choose to switch from eating American food to Chinese food gradually or immediately.

### Society Versus Partnership

A society is 3 or more entities working towards a common goal or interest. 

A partnership is a bit different as it needs to two entities as a minimum. 

Thus, a childless husband and wife is a partnership. It becomes a society after having a child. 

A family is a common example of a society. 

A basketball team is a society, different from tennis-doubles players that form a partnership. 

Since a team is a society, it also is subject to social cycles which manifest as winning and losing streaks. The cycles represent the changing flow of desire of the society-organism.

{{< q a="Hume" c="The Treatise Of Human Nature Section 1, Part 3, Book 3" >}}
The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations. No one can be actuated by any affection which others are not susceptible to. In wound-up strings, the motion of one string communicates itself to the rest. So all the affections readily pass from one person to another, and beget correspondent movements in every human creature.
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 10" >}}
Few people ever reflect that from the evil of other men, something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others becomes more and more difficult to repress
{{< /q >}}


> Our definition gives flexible wave-like properties to societies


This flexibility lets souls send and receive invisible information via intuition. In our music analogy, the orchestra can get visual hints from the conductor to speed up the tempo or make the strings louder. 

This flexible quality also lets souls merge and agree, as proven by the phrase "the meeting of minds" or "being on the same page". This would be like an orchestra adding more instruments that jive with its style. 

It explains why Chinese adopted chopsticks, while Europeans adopted spoon and fork

- The wavelength of chopsticks-idea matched the wavelength of the Chinese society-organism, causing it to be assimilated
- The wavelength of spoon-and-fork-idea matched the wavelength of the European society-organism

By knowing the difference between the wavelength of the chopsticks-idea and spoon-and-fork-idea then we can find a middle-ground vibration that can be acceptable to both Chinese and Europeans. In this way, the wavelength of their societies can be harmonized and be on the same page instead of being contrary and opposing.   


Unlike waves, matter and physical objects cannot occupy the same physical 'page' without losing their individual identity.

This **merging of the minds or mental-waves** manifests as:
- the formation of society
- the establishment of friendships
- the creation of companies
- nation-building, etc.

For example:
- A family begins when a man's soul agrees to unite with a woman's soul which then adds another soul as their child. A divorce is a dissociation of the soul the family back into its component souls
- A company begins when the souls of the incorporators agree to be bound into a business organization
- A sports team begins when the souls of playes agree to play together


### The Scalability of Societies via Common Interest

The ability of waves to merge to become a bigger wave is best seen in an orchestra where single instruments can merge to become a single, larger, and more sophisticated sound-wave.

<!-- ## Common Interest as the Personal-Interest or Conscience of Society

Human society began as families agreeing to work together for mutual benefit, which we call [the common interest](/social/supersociology/principles/part-1/chapter-03). 

We can say that **the common interest is the conscience of the soul of society**, just as a person's own conscience represents his soul's best interest for himself. We refrain from doing a bad thing because our conscience will implant the feeling of guilt in our minds, as a natural warning about the resulting consequence or [karma](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04/).  -->


Since societies are made up of waves of individual souls, then they can agree and merge with other societies to form nations, which can merge to form confederations, which can finally form a global human society. 

This unity is based on the similarities of the waves in the group. In a society, this is called the common interest. 

Social Superphysics aims to form such a unified society by explaining the properties of the soul, as well as the dynamics of common interest, as explained by Socrates, David Hume, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. 


Lateral Type | Metaphysical Organism | Physical Example | Parts | Explanation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Personal | Mind or Soul (Jivatman) | You or Self (Jiva) | Perception  Your perceptions mold your mind | 
Group | Soul of society | A basketball team | Individual minds | Society is molded by the minds inside it (A weak basketbal team is one with weak members) 
Species | Soul of species | Human species | Individual societies | Species evolve as one in order to live better 
Planetary | Soul of planet | Earthlings | Each species (cats, dogs, humans, potatoes) | All species evolve according to their planet's conditions | 
Stellar | Soul of the star system | system | Individual planets | All planets affect each other 
Galactic | Soul of galaxy | Milky way | Individual stars | Life begins from supernova which spread throughout its galaxy 
Universal | Soul of universe |  Physical Universe | Individual galaxies | The galaxies form the mind of the universe as a portion of Existence
Multiversal | Soul of Existence (Paramatman) | Multiverse (Brahma) | Individual Universes and Realities |  The physical and metaphysical parts of the universe form Brahma 


The entire human species is therefore one big society made up of all human minds or souls. 
- David Hume and Socrates use the analogy of citizens being the individual souls, with their government as the oversoul. 
- Quesnay uses the analogy of cells in a body.
- Hinduism uses the analogy of the atman (consciousness) making up the paramatman (universal collective consciousness).

If common interest naturally unites humans into societies, why do we see so much inequality, hate, and conflict?

These are caused by the ego, as the feeling of the self.
