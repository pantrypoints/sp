The flexibility of the soul (or malleability of the mind) is the main quality that allows it to connect and merge with other souls, whether it be of animals, plants, or humans. 

This, together with the principle that like attracts like (as the foundation of the common interest), allows souls to form into society. 

- The flexibility makes souls and societies dynamic and scaleable 
- The similarlity keeps the waves together 


The loss of this flexibility (as the rigidity of the mind) disconnects the soul from others and confines it to itself.

This confinement builds ego, which is the feeling for the self. 

When left unchecked, this ego leads to disagreements, disunity, and eventual conflict. The more democratic the society, the more difficult it is to maintain unity:

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Simple Wealth of Nations Book 5, Chapter 3" >}}
Rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small democracies. Those factions have so frequently divided their people and disturbed the peace of their democratic governments.

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 9" >}}
When the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division, the several parts are just. 
{{< /q >}}


The ego is built up by the current ideologies of liberalism, materialism, and even science which treats the soul (and therefore the merging of souls) as pseudo-science. And so no one studies it and everyone remains ignorant of how to actually work together to solve so many current problems. 

For example, science knows that countries must work together to stop global warming, but is actually impotent to make them do so. And so the planet heads for a slow extinction thanks to science and the current liberal and materialist beliefs.  

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Simple Republic by Plato, Book 10" >}}
Are you not aware that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable? ..But reason will not allow us to believe this. It will not let us believe that the soul, in its truest nature, is full of variety, difference, and dissimilarity.

There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself' because the master is also the servant and the servant is the master since the same person is denoted. It really means that in the human soul there is a better and a worse principle. When the better has the worse under control, then a man the master of himself. When due to evil education or association, the better principle is overwhelmed by the worse principle, then the man is blamed and is called "unprincipled" or the slave of the self.

## The Solution: Harness the Common Interest via Social Networkism 

<!-- Dialectical Social Networkism -->

It would be easier to prevent the growth of ego by pointing out that no one is perfect:

- A beautiful woman will have most of her attention on her physical looks, making her deficient in intellect
- An intelligent man will have most of his attention on abstract ideas, making him deficient in bodily strength or looks

In the above, the common interest is **overall personal well-being**.

- A popular politician will spend most of his time interacting with the masses, instead of spending time for policy research
- A bright researcher will have many good policy-ideas, but will not have the popularity or connections to have them implemented

In the above, the common interest is **implementing the right policies**.

- A skilled app developer can create a superior app, but might not have the skill to market it 
- An active marketer can make any app go viral, but might not know how to make an app in the first place

In the above, the common interest is **spreading useful apps**.

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 5, Chapter 2">}}
Then in our city, the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other. They will have their pleasures and pains in common. They will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own'. Having this common interest, they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain. The is because the guardians will have a community of women and children. We called this unity of feeling as the greatest good.

Thus, the key to common interest is to **group everyone according to ideas that would interest them**. This would let them gravitate to it and hopefully lower their egos in order to explore that idea further. 

For example, we sometimes go to Meetups about the food, technology, artists, and sports that we like. Nowadays, the internet, social networks, and messaging apps like Whatsapp, Zalo, and Viber help us to access such interests virtually. 



## Facebook is a Personal Network, Not a Social Network

Unfortunately, some social apps group people not to build the common interest, but merely funnel advertisements more effectively. An example is Facebook which lets its users add other users that they like, creating a **personal network** instead of a proper social network.  

Those users can then post whatever is in their personal interest which then creates a personal bubble or echo chamber that might go against other bubbles. If left unchecked, it can lead to online conflict, followed by real physical conflict or harm.

{{< dc t="Update 2024" >}}
This is even more evident in the discussion site called Reddit, where the ability to express ideas is based on karma points which are from upvotes. This merely strengthens the current ideologies that are creating the current dysfunctional world.

<!-- traps its users in an echo chamber that can help it serve ads that strike our personal or group interest. 

In addition, Facebook has no active regulator to keep its users united or prevent conflict. This creates disharmony which increases into radicalism since the interactions are often left unchecked* in the name of freedom. -->

<!-- Because Facebook has no regulator, anyone can add users according to their whim. Therefore, it is really a personal network instead of a real social network since personal interest, and not common interest, dominates. This creates a  -->

In order to earn more from ads, some social networks focus on user quantity instead of user quality. Our system is different because it earns primarily from a tax, as [Pointtax](https://www.pantrypoints.com/services/tax/), and only secondarily from advertising.

A true social network therefore is one that encourages personal interest as long as it is within the common interest. This necessitates a regulator, just as an early society has a chieftain and a modern society has a President or Prime Minister. 

The key qualification of this regulator is his understanding of the common interest as to keep the society unified and whole. His whole moral authority depends on this. 

Socrates' version of the regulators are the guardians who are morally upright:


{{< q a="Socrates" >}}
The guardians will be delivered from all these evils. Their life will be more blessed than the life of Olympic victors. The Olympic victor is happy to receive a part only of the blessedness secured to our citizens. The citizens' victory is the salvation of the State at the public cost. The crown with which they and their children have is the fulness of all that life needs.

<!-- 
 therefore not based on arbitrary friend-additions, but on real social contracts or promises, as desribed by David Hume. This is why our proposed economic system is based on social contracts, as a tool to realize the common interest. Thus we define dialectical social networkism as a paradigm that uses Dialectics to implement a system of social contracts, under a moral authority, in order to generate sustainable happiness for the self through its society and beyond.

In future posts, we will explain how this moral authority can be implemented by machine learning in order to create what Socrates calls guardians.
 -->


We implement his guardians as [ISAIAH](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah) which is the machine learning that will regulate our proposed points-based economic network which implements our concept of social networkism desribed here. Thus, social networkism is made up of the following ideas:

- The soul of society being made up of individual souls that merge and dissociate flexibly
- A common interest that unifies such souls together into a society 
- A moral leader or regulator to protect and grow that common interest

It is similar to the dynamics of a Republic or Aristocracy as described by Socrates and Spinoza. It is not a wild democracy as is in force in the United States and in most countries that allow free elections.

In democracies, it is not the best men who are appointed to govern, but those who happen to be wealthy or to be eldest sons.
