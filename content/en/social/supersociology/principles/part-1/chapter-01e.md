A society-organism is a compound soul made up of a collection of waves which are represented by the soul-wave of every citizen. 

The citizens that do not match the overall wave naturally leaves or wants to leave, or forms a mini-society with others of similar waves. 

A society that is very harmonious allows concerted action whether as an army, research group, economic group, or cultural group.  

At that point, it develops its own notable identity which is called a civilization. 
- A society can become a state.
- A state can become a civilization. 

A society only needs mutual agreement based on common interest. 

A state needs to have that common interest codified into laws. 

A civilization needs much more than laws. Here, we give 5 requirements derived from Indian philosopher PR Sarkar:



### 1. A Clear Ideology

A civilziation needs to have a clear ideology in order to harmonize its individual waves. 

When we hear notable music, we can clearly classify its genre as rock, rap, pop, classical, etc. 

Likewise, a civilization needs to have its own ideology to define its wave. This will then let its citizens match or mold themselves to that wave instead of contributing to messy or discordant music.

This harmony of waves was explained by Ibn-Khaldun as group feeling:


For example:
- pre-Han civlizations (as Warring States) were based on Taoism, while the current Han civlization is based on Confucianism or the ideology of Confucius. 
- The Arabs became a civilization when they adopted the ideology of Prophet Mohammad. This made them into the Arab-Muslim civilization.  


{{< img alt="Cicero giving a speech" src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/medieval/cicero.jpg" cap="Cicero was the embodiment of high morals during the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire, as seen in his rhetoric. Such high morals, as a sign of ideology, were lost after the Romans switched to the Catholic system" >}}


<!-- Much of your energy is misused due to the ignorance of your own self and the destination towards which you are moving. This misuse of energy is bound to cause destruction. -->


### 2. Cultural Practices 

The ideology must have physical manifestation. This manifests as culture. 

For example:
- the Confucian Chinese have rigid rituals and hierarchies as the expression of their Confucian ideology 
- the Arabs have Islamic culture, most notably as architecture, food, and Shariah, to express the ideology of Prophet Mohammad

<!-- Everyone has a physical structure. The problem with every individual is to produce more and more ectoplasmic stuff by the body and then to convert it into consciousness. 

There should be a proper process for this conversion. Spiritual cult consists of the conversion of the five rudimental factors into ectoplasmic stuff and then into consciousness through a special scientific process. 

This is a process of metamorphosis. Spiritual cult therefore, is indispensable. But only spiritual ideology and spiritual philosophy will not do. -->

### 3. Socio-economic Theory

<!-- Asti and Bhati is -->

An ideology will only be adopted if it leads to physical well being. 

And so socio-economics has to be part of that ideology. 

- Confucianism has political and taxation systems, as well as resource allocation 
- Islam has Islamic banking, taxation, and welfare systems


{{< q c="The Analects Simplified, Chapter 2" >}}
The disciple Yen-Yu applied for some grain on behalf of his mother. 

Confucius: Give her 3 pecks.

He applied for more. 

Confucius: Give her 8, then.

Yen-Yu gave his mother 50 times that amount.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- ### 4. Social outlook
A socio-economic theory is of no use but for this fraternal feeling. 
 -->

### 4. The transmission of its ideology

The ideology has to be written or orally transmitted from person to person and from one generation to another.

- The Aryans transmitted their ideologies (as beliefs and laws) orally, leading to the Aryan civilization. 
- The Chinese have the works of Confucius
- The Arabs have the Quran
- The Romans have the 12 Tables



### 5. A leader to craft or carry its ideology

{{< q a="Ibn-Khaldun" c="Muqaddimah Simplified, Chapter2 Part 19" >}}
Royal authority is a goal of group feeling. Thus, he who obtains group feeling guarantees power.
{{< /q >}}

A leader is required to guide or to make the citizens match the ideology. 

This is like a conductor of an orchestra to harmonize all the instruments to match the flow of the musical piece. 

Notable leaders are:
- Alexander the Great of the Greeks, spreading Aristotle's ideology
- Marcus Aurelius of the Romans, spreading Stoical ideology
- The Ming emperor, spreading Confucian ideology through its treasure fleet
- Spanish conquistadros under the rule of Philip II, spreading Catholic ideology
- Hitler of the Nazis, spreading Nazi ideology throughout Europe trying to establish a Third Reich civilization

Note that Genghis Khan, Attila the Hum are leaders, but are not from a civilization. 


## The Collapse of Civilizations

Civilizations collapse when these ingredients are lacking. 

- Roman civilization collapsed when they switched their pagan ideology for the Catholic
- Persian civilization collapsed when Zoroaster's ideology was replaced by Islam, with more complete ingredients
- Asian and African civilizations collapsed during European colonization because of the better leadership and economics (productivity and resource allocation) of the Europeans
- China's civilization was signficantly reduced when Confucianism was overshadowed by the Mercantile ideology of the British and the Marxist Ideology of the Communists. 


<!-- Societies are created when indvidual people come together under a common interest to achieve something. For example:
- a group of military countries form an alliance for mutual defense or to attack another country
- a group of criminals agree to join forces to be a crime syndicate
- a group of teenagers agree to meet after school to start a rock band

All such alliances, syndicates, and bands are societies that require its members to agree to be part of the group or project. This agreement is an imposition which requires the members to follow do's and dont's which then is the basis for the morals of that group. 

Since morals are the basis for the creation of societies, then the decline of morals are the cause of a society's voluntary dissolution, whether a rock band or a civilization. All long-running civilizations are rooted in their own indigenous moral system. Their morals make their way into their laws which then regulates the egos of its citizens in order to create those long-running civilizations. -->

<!-- Long-running empires have their morals baked into their laws and traditions:
- The Romans had their Roman morals
- The Holy Roman empire had Catholicism
- The Chinese had Confucianism
- The Persians had 
- The Indians have Hinduism
- The Americans have liberalism which specifically rejects monarchy

In contrast, short-running empires usually have laws based on a single genius founder like Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, or Napoleon Bonaparte. Their laws, and the morals that glue their empires, vanishes after the founder dies or after [three generations from the founder](https://business.smu.edu.sg/master-wealth-management/lkcsb-community/how-beat-third-generation-curse).


The empire declines or is destroyed when their moral systems get overturned or cancelled:
- Roman morals were destroyed by the Catholic Church from Constantine
- The Holy Roman Empire was destroyed by the Protestant Reformation
- Persia was destroyed by Islam from Arabia, with its Zoroastrian morals mutating into Shia Islam

- America's liberalism is slowly being destroyed by neoliberalism which creates an unseen monarchy through its oligarchs

Some people wrongly attribute the collapse of empires to decadence or its citizens being selfish. This is not entirely true because the decadence might or might not be a sign of a changing moral system.
- Rome was decadent under Caligula and Nero, but was still very much intact hundreds of years afterwards.
- China was decadent during its Ming period, but we still consider its replacement Qing as part of the Chinese empire -->
