The [invisible hand](/social/economics/invisible-hand) is the dharma that goes with everything in existence which represents the design or plan made by its inventor or creator. 
- A smartphone is designed to withstand being dropped a few feet, but not many meters
- A basketball, on the other hand, is designed to withstand being dropped from long distances 

We can say that the dharma of a smartphone in this sense is different from that of a basketball.  

{{< i s="/photos/tech/phone.jpg" alt="Phone and a smartphone" c="A smartphone has a nature very different from a basketball" >}}

This dharma then leads to the different "do's and dont's" or "moral rules" for handling: 
- A smartphone must be held carefully and not dropped, but a basketball can be thrown long distances 
- A smartphone can be put inside your pocket, but a basketball cannot

Here we can see that **morality differs on the objects and its situation in space and time.** 
- A bulky cellphone in the 1980's cannot be put inside the pocket, different from a modern cellphone
- A rubber ball made 200 years ago will not survive being dunked, very different from a modern basketball

Similarly among humans, the moral rules of a certain time period can be very different from that of another even in the same place. For example:
- the early Jews had a policy of an eye-for-an-eye
- this was later reversed by Jesus who advocated forgiveness
- this was then overturned by the Prophet Mohammad who sanctioned revenge or punishment

The difference in the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian moral policies is because:
- During the Jewish period, international politics was lawless, barbaric, and unstable
- During the Christian period, politics and economy was stable under the Romans
- During Mohammad's time, the Roman and Persian empires were unstable, leading to external barbarism

<!--   lawless and barbaric
  from that of Jesus, is due to the fact that the former was created during a disorderly time when the people were under constant threat from Assyrians, Babylonians, and Arab tribes. Jesus, on the other hand, lived in a stable period under Roman rule.  -->

{{< i s="/photos/medieval/rome.jpg" a="Basketball" c="The Romans provided a lot of stability" >}}

In this case, the difference in political condition led to differences in moral policy. This is then due to the fact that politics, laws, and morals are all based on feelings which change through time. These changing feelings change what humans are supposed to do and not do. 


## Why do our feelings change?

Feelings change because they are a metaphysical wave* that comes in contact with physical space-time. A wave has crests and troughs and are never a straight line. These ups and downs leads to the morals of one era being overturned by another era, to be itself overturned later. Because of this, even academics are unable to accurately define morality.


{{< i s="/graphics/viz.png" a="Visualization of music" c="Feelings always change just like waves" >}}

<!-- our Metaphysics of Things Cartesian Duality -->
{{< f f="*Our definition of morality is based on Superphysics which splits existence into a metaphysical domain made up of waves, and a physical domain made up of particles, such as quark-particles and soul-particles existing in space and time." >}}



Similarly:
- a rubber sports ball can change its design, size, and other specification depending on what sports people feel is the best one
- a cellphone can add more features and become a smartphone because its manufacturer feels the need for improvement

Both changes aim for the maximum usefulness or "good" for the ball and phone respectively.


## A Proper Definition of Morals

In order to create a moral system that is universal (across space) and more long lasting (across time), we must go to the root and define what morals are.

Morality is Latin for manners. Manners define do's and dont's.

In humans, the universal good is happiness. This allows us to define morals based on happiness. 

<!-- With this in mind, we can define human morals or do's and dont's as: -->

- **Moral** — a quality that produces happiness for now and for as long as possible, for the self and for as many entities as possible.
  - We define entities as anything that the mind regards as having an identity
  - We define happiness as being in line with dharma, which itself is timeless
- **Morality** — a state of being moral
- **Moral Philosophy** — the organized system of ideas designed to bring about morality

Notice that our definition of moral is not absolute in the sense that it does not include infinity nor all entities. The phrase "for as long as possible" forces the mind to think of future consequences, while "as many entities as possible" forces the ego to go outside of the self. 

<!-- our Metaphysics of Things -->
The root idea behind morality is happiness which is a positive wave from which other positive waves, such as virtues, come about. 

Hume's first virtues are justice and benevolence. This matches the idea of Socrates, who put prime importance to justice (which we interpret as dharma).


{{< q a="David Hume" c="An Enquiry Concerning The Principles Of Morals" >}}
We shall begin by looking into the social virtues of benevolence and justice. This will then lead us to other social virtues.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 2 Chapter 2" >}}
Dharma [Justice] is sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
{{< /q >}}


By forcing the mind to think into the future and into other entities, the mind will naturally discover the patterns that will point to the dynamics of a Supreme Entity that works behind the scenes to generate reality and existence. 

This would force backward humans to get their minds out of the monkey-state where the mind does not think and the heart does not feel. This then will replace the animal morals of mere eating, sleeping, having sex, marking territory, etc.


## How is Superphysics Morals Different The Greatest Happiness Principle?

The John Stuart Mill also advocated a principle of happiness similar to Epicurus and Benhtam:

{{< q a="John Stuart Mill" c="Utilitarianism Simplified" >}}
The Greatest Happiness Principle says that actions which promote happiness are moral, actions which produce the reverse of happiness are immoral.
{{< /q >}}

The two main differences between Superphysics Morals and such Utilitarian Morals is that the latter is:
- based on pleasure from shallow sensory perceptions, usually from the material layer 
- based on such pleasure as a short-term effect or instance of pleasure

Superphysics Morals, on the other hand, is based on the higher pleasures, specifically from the spatial (mental) and aethereal layers (spiritual). It is also 'emergent', meaning that it is based on the spatial layer or space and time which always changes.

The spatial layer is why Superphysics morals:
- is not fixed
- focuses on maximum people and maximum length of time.
