The previous section defined the impartial spectator as the higher mind, as opposed to the lower mind. 


Both minds perceive reality through inherent detectors:
- The lower mind has a detection system based on the 5 senses, primarily through the brain.
- The higher mind has a detection system based on intuition, primarily through the heart.


## Morals are Sensed by the Moral Sense as Conscience and the Common Interest

The detection of good and bad is therefore done by the higher mind through the heart, specifically the heart chakra. 

<!-- Previously, we defined "moral" as a quality that produces lasting happiness. 

If physical beauty is a quality that produces aesthetic satisfaction sensed through our eyes, and melody is a quality that produces audible pleasure sensed through our ears, how do we sense what is moral or immoral?  -->

The perceptions of the heart chakra is then compared by the higher mind to its dharma. This creates a decision tree which it cascades to the lower mind in order to drive motor actions. 


<!-- Instead of conscience, Smith explains that it is a moral sense that is present in all humans which transcends the ego or self-love.  -->

In Buddhism, this comparing-action is called *prajna-paramita*, which is a feeling-sense just like ‘vision’ is a visual sense and ‘hearing’ is a auditory sense. It is inherent just like instinct is inherent. ‘Conscience’ is then derived from this moral sense.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
The foundation of our moral faculties were given to us to direct of our conduct in this life, whether those foundations are from a modification of reason, an original instinct called a moral sense, or some other principle of our nature. They carry along with them the most evident badges of this authority. These denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and judge how far each of them was to be indulged or restrained.

In Buddhism, this moral sense is then part of human dharma, which Smith calls the invisible hand. However, even if this moral sense is present in all humans, it is not readily or so easily activated because it is very often clouded by ego or self love (ahamkara in Sanskrit):

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
He soon identifies himself with the ideal man within the breast. He soon becomes himself the impartial spectator of his own situation... If he wants the impartial spectator to enter into the principles of his conduct he must humblethe arrogance of his self-love..

The concept of impartial spectator is derived from David Hume, though the Hindus defined it first, to be later developed by Buddhists, creating guidelines and practices to develop the moral sense.


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Part 3, Sec 1 Treatise of Human Nature" >}}
An object which causes pleasure to its possessor is sure to please the spectator by a delicate sympathy with the possessor.

An Arab man experiences injustice. By watching nationalist propaganda, his mind connects Western imperialism to the injustice. His strong feelings increase his ego enough to cloud his moral sense to become a terrorist and successfully attacks a Western target.

The Western soldier sees this and his moral sense guides him to strike back at the terror camp. However, his ego forces him to rush the job and hit innocent people as collateral damage.

Those victims suffer injustice and sees the moral duty to strike back. In all cases and without exception, **the ego is the cause of the corruption of moral sentiments** as it increases the sense of our own greatness, subsequently preventing the mind from putting itself in the situation of others as fellow-feeling.


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part 4" >}}
However, it is also the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments. Moralists in all ages have complained that wealth and greatness are often regarded with the respect and admiration due only to wisdom and virtue, and that poverty and weakness is unjustly given the contempt due only to vice and folly.We desire to be respectable and to be respected. We dread to be contemptible and to be condemned.

## How Religions Implement the Moral Feelings

Religions have developed different strategies to quell the ego and develop the impartial spectator or encourage the moral sense:
- Hinduism prevents the ego from being fed by **renouncing the world**
- Buddhism stifles the ego by **controlling the mind**
- Christianity dilutes the ego by encouraging it to take into account other egos, as **the Golden rule**
- Islam crushes the ego by **forcing obedience** to strict moral rules which are supposed to be given by an artificial construct called *Allah*, which is really the impartial spectator or moral sense of **the Prophet Mohammad**

Superphysics imposes moral feelings naturally through our proposed [points-based economic system](/social/economics/why-business-is-immoral), derived from the requirements of David Hume and Adam Smith. 




<!-- 
The key thing that separates a reality of suffering and a reality of joy, is then knowing how feelings lead to mentality and how mentality creates reality. To understand this latter part, we need to define consciousness. This would help us break out of the limitations created by science which is based primarily on the five senses, ignoring the sixth sense of feelings and intuition.
 -->

<!-- One just has to look at the night sky to imagine the chaos that exists, as moon getting hit by countless meteorites, and the sun burning planets  -->

<!-- From realizing Its true form as The One, we can then work downwards into The Supreme Entity and explain how Existence is generated.  
Our best analogy for Existence is the internet which creates an online reality.  -->

<!-- 
all possess human-like qualities as to be angry, benevolent, merciful, etc. 

So where does our idea of a personal God, Yahweh, Tara, or Ganesh come from?

<!-- ## An Effect of the Positive Force

The human mind naturally creates the idea of God to have an extremely positive counterweight to extremely negative perceptions* such as pain, suffering, typhoons, earthquakes,  death, poverty, evil, etc. 

> *We say "Oh my God!" more during bad and suprising experiences than in regular and ordinary ones. We rarely say "Oh my God, I'm eating breakfast" or "Oh my God, I'm breathing and reading a blog post"


The proof is that all human societies see God as a positive entity Who loves the good and punishes the bad, and never the other way around. 
- Polytheism is having many god-ideas to counterbalance many isolated negative perceptions
- Monotheism is having a single God-idea for all negative perceptions
- Atheism is in treating all perceptions as they are -- as Existence, neither positive nor negative
- Agnosticism is in not bothering to think about the specifics at all

In our internet analogy:
- Positivity is information, Negativity is lack of information
- Atheism is the 'internet'
- Monotheism is 'AWS, Google Cloud, Azure'
- Polytheism is 'local webservers and VPN'
- Agnosticism is using the internet without caring how it works

In our novel analogy, where the novel stands for Existence:
- Positivity is a story, Negativity is not having a story
- Atheism is a novel having an unknown author
- Polytheism is having many authors
- Monotheism is having one author
- Agnosticism is enjoying the novel without caring who the author is


## Omnitheism to Unify All the Feelings

Here we introduce the concept of **omnitheism** which is the knowledge of how different types of people view the Creator of Existence. Its goal is to bring harmony to the different religions, each of which pushes their own idea of the Creator to the detriment of others. They ignore the fact that different societies have different negative experiences which lead to them requiring a different of God-idea.

For example:
- The Jews were surrounded by strong enemies such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. And so they felt* the need to create a Yahweh that was strong
- The Romans were imperial so they felt the need to invent their God to be superior to all other gods
- The Arabs were tribal and unruly, often causing raids and disorders. And so the Prophet Mohammad felt the need to craft Allah to make them submit to a single God
- The Hindus were multicultural and so they felt the need to invent different gods for their different cultures
- The Buddha saw the problems with Hinduism and so he created Buddhism as to have no personal God, and instead rely on the impersonal Sunya or Zen -->
 
<!-- Thus, for monotheism and polytheism, the idea of God is the positive counterweight to negative things in Existence, while for Atheism and Omnitheism, God is that Existence itself. 

The definition of the former focuses on the negative aspect of Existence, such as Apocalypse, the Devil, and the End of Days, while the latter does not. Since mentality creates reality, we go with the latter definition. In this way, we build a system that is naturally free from conflict and negativity, very different from the other systems that have naturally-perpetual conflict .
 -->

<!-- > *We emphasize 'felt the need' in order to be consistent with [our moral solution](/superphysics/principles/idea) of getting all the feelings of diifferent human societies so that we can find the lowest-common-denominator-feeling. 


If all the inventions of God, Yahweh, Allah, etc are all caused by our positive feelings in their effort to counteract negative feelings, then finding a common positive feeling can lead to a framework to unify all those Supreme Deities for the sake of peace and unity instead of division and conflict. 

Omnitheism proposes to do this by having only two things:

1. Existence - this is the impersonal Whole
2. A Supreme Entity - this is the personal Deity

Existence has infinite (or arbitrary) attributes, whereas the Supreme Entity only has two attributes:

1. It is Supreme
2. It is an Entity

Thus, the impersonal Matrix, Sunya, Brahma, Tao represents Existence, while the personal God, Allah, Yahweh, Kali, Ganesh, represent the personal solutions to the negativity in Existence. 

The more negativity the mind experiences, the more deities it needs to create as a counterweight. But since negativity arises from ignorance, then the more knowledge humans get, the less the need for having so many deities with so many attributes. 

For example, in the ancient past, humans didn't know the principles behind volcanic eruptions and so they assigned it to a volcano-god. After geology was known, then the volcano-god no longer needs to exist. 

We can extend this pattern and say that as humans learn and master the principles of Existence, then the less their need for numerous deities or for a Supreme Deity to have so many attributes. Instead, those attributes transfer over onto those existential principles. This is why our Supreme Entity concept only has two attributes, and Existence has infinite ones.
