## Social Cycles + Spacetime

Modern Sociology and Political Science have confused different socio-political belief systems with each other. The most common examples are:
- Socialism being confused with Communism
- Liberalism being confused with Libertarianism
- Capitalism being confused with Business Interests


<!-- While this solves such a problem for this generation, future generations might hijack and usurp these repaired ideas and render them messed up as usual.  -->

To fix this, we created the Ideology Matrix which classifies every socio-economic-political idea that can be possibly generated by the human mind.

It combines David Hume's explanation of the dynamics of the mind, with Socrates' cycles which match the Hindu Varnashrama system and the Egyptian class system:

Socrates | Hinduism | Egyptian
--- | --- | ---
Democracy | Shudras | Shepherds, Hunters
Tyranny | Ksatriyas | Warriors
Aristocracy | Brahmins | Priests
Oligarchy | Vaeshyas | Artificiers


{{< q a="Priest-of-Sais" c="Timaeus by Plato" >}}
Our society is made up of:
- a caste of priests separated from all the others
- artificers, who ply their several crafts by themselves
- shepherds, hunters, husbandmen
- warriors who are distinct from all the other classes
{{< /q >}}
 

By doing so, we:
- unify eastern and western metaphysics 
- show that both had the same core observations of human society and the human species, but using different terminologies


{{< me d="December 2021" >}}
We have now systematized this as the [Four Laws of Value](/social/economics/principles/intro/chapter-04)
{{< /me >}}

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic, Book 8" >}}
The four governments are those of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded. Oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved. It is a form of government which teems with evils. Democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very different. Lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst State. 
{{< /q >}}


{{< img src="/graphics/social/cycles.png" cap="In Social Superphysics, democracy is populist (shudra), tyranny is militant (ksattriya), aristocracy is philosophical (brahmin), and oligarchy is mercantile (vaesya). These then are caused by the Four Laws of Value which are the metaphysical counterparts of the physical Four Laws of Thermodynamics" alt="Social Cycles">}}

It's a 3D matrix that classifies ideas based on three axes:

- Selfishness-nonselfishness 
  - This is a function of ego or the entity observing existence
  - Selfishness is from the Negative Force. Non-Selfishness is from the Positive (though from the perspective of the self, selfishness can be seen as Positive and selflessness as Negative)
- Objectivism-nonobjectivism 
  - This is a function of the natural duality of existence, or physics versus metaphysics, within space-time
  - Objectivism is from the Negative Force. Subjectivism (respecting the opinion of others) is from the Positive
- Social cycles
  - This is a function of how the ego changes in duality in different space-times, as how the Positive and Negative fight each other

By plotting their core ideas in our matrix, it is easier to see how Marxism (Communism) is different from all other belief systems.

The ideas then progress in a cyclical way from democracy to oligarchy, then back to democracy. For example:

- the expansionist ideas of the tyrannical Mongol Yuan dynasty was overturned by the Ming dynasty
- the Ming started as aristocratic but turned oligarchic as it focused on trade and its Treasure fleet
- the Ming Hong Wu emperor was later overturned by the isolationist policy of the more-democratic Qing dynasty
- finally, it was overturned by Communist tyranny

{{< i s="/graphics/social/ideology3d.jpg" a="Ideology Matrix 3D" >}}

In America, this can be seen in:

- the oligarchy created by George W. Bush which was overturned by the democracy of Obama
- the democracy of Obama was later overturned by the tyranny of Trump 

<!-- From this, we can say that the tyrannical stage of America and China differs in their objective-ness, with China striving for standardization via their social credit system, while Trump goes for more arbitrariness. -->

### Vectorization of Ideas (Update Nov 2024)

The plotting of these abstract ideas and ideologies through time exposes how they change through the years. For example:
- The Communism in China under Mao is differnt from the Communism of Xi which has state capitalism
  - We can say that China's Communism has moved towards more personal selfishness, but still not as selfish as Western Capitalism
- The belief in Jesus of the Catholic church is different from the belief of the modern evangelical churches
  - The modern era has changed Jesus from a non-objective spiritual Saviour into an objective prosperity giver
- The Big Bang theory during the time of Einstein is different from the modern Lambda CDM model
  - The modern theory is more objective because of the data from modern telescopes  

These movements of ideas can be thought of as vectors in a vector space which we call the aetherspace. The goal of Superphysics is to move human ideologies towards the center by applying both a pull and push tactic. This is similar to the hammer and anvil approach of Alexander the Great.

For example:
- in authoritarian countries like China and North Korea, personal autonomy under a single ruler or ideology could be encouraged
- in liberal countries like the US and Europe, materialism can be checked by pushing people towards abstract non-objective ideas through the central education system

 
The most sustainable ideologies, political philosophies, and economic systems are those that are near the center, which balance non-selfishness and objective-ness, while adapting to changes in the social cycles. 

In [Buddhism](/research/schumacher/buddhist-economics/part-1), this is called the Middle Way and is essential to sustainable happiness. 

In economics, this would be Capitalist systems having a bit of Socialism (as what the Nordic countries are doing), or Socialist systems having a bit of Capitalism (as what China is doing, though they seem to take the state capitalism side too far).

## Israel Example

We can visualize the flow of Israeli society-organism below:

{{< i s="/graphics/social/vector.jpg" a="Ideology Matrix 3D with Vector" c="Israel was mostly going against its Dharma since its founding" >}}

The central part represents the dharma of society. Being far from the center means that the society was away from its dharma or was adharmic. 



## Essential to Social Superphysics

The ideology matrix is an essential part of Social Superphysics as it will help advance beliefs and ideologies that are near the center, yet flexible enough to fit the current cycle of the country where it will be implemented. This will make it global yet local at the same time. It is implemented as one of the features of ISAIAH Match which is our machine learning platform.
