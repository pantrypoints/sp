The generally positive opinion on the rule of Queen Elizabeth is proof that not all dynasties are bad. 

This contradicts the liberals who argue that long dynasties are corrupt or evil and should be banned. 

But their reasoning is wrong because dyasties become evil from a collapse of morals and not by mere continuation of dynastic rule.

Any continued rule tends to make the mind complacent and weaken its morals, whether dynastic or not (i.e. party-based).

Dynasties get blamed most often in this because family ties are generally tighter than party ties. 

In fact, hereditary rule was the norm from ancient times until the French Revolution and World War 1 when the morals of the Eurpoean monarchs all declined with the improvement of firearms and cannons. 

Instead of banning dynasties, the proper policy is to raise the moral standard, especially for long running ruling parties or political families.
