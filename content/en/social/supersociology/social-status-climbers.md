The phenomenon of social status and social climbers are sourced from vanity or an ego that is too strong.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Part 6 Sec 3 of TMS" >}}
"The vain man sees the respect which is paid to rank and fortune, and wishes to usurp this respect, as well as that for talents and virtues. His dress, his equipage, his way of living, accordingly, all announce both a higher rank and a greater fortune than really belong to him; and in order to support this foolish imposition for a few years in the beginning of his life, he often reduces himself to poverty and distress long before the end of it. As long as he can continue his expence, his vanity is delighted with viewing himself as how he wants.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" >}}
Obscure strangers who visit foreign countries often practise it. If their stay is short, they may escape any disgraceful detection. After indulging their vanity for a few years, they may return to their own homes, and repair, by future parsimony, the waste of their past profusion."
