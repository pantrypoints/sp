Islamic terrorism became known worldwide because of the 9/11 attacks which overshadowed previous attacks from the 1970’s. Since then, terrorism has been unfortunately and unfairly connected to Islam.

This connection is easily brought back up whenever a terrorist attack occurs, whether it was rooted in Islam or not. 

Whenever a terrorist attack occurs, the common expectation nowadays is for it to be caused by a disgruntled Muslim. 

Whenever it **is** proven to be caused by a Muslim, anti-Islam sentiments rise. Muslims then take a defensive stance. 

Proper Muslims expectedly denounce the attack and say that it was un-Islamic. But by then, the connection between Islam and terrorism would have really formed in the public’s mind. 

This in turn causes the public to be anti-Islamic. This creates more disgruntled Muslims who can get easily radicalized, creating more terrorists. 

The cycle is thus created and strengthened. We can call this 'the cycle of extremism'.


{{< img src="/graphics/psych/suffering.png" alt="The cycle of extremism" cap="The cycle of extremism starts with the suffering felt by the extremist. This suffering remains unresolved and so it snowballs into terrorism. Anti-terror policies must therefore strike at the cause of suffering, as this is easier than calming down the negative or angry public reaction." >}}



## The Cause: Connecting ideas to other ideas, which are just remotely connected

Since it is obvious that terrorist attacks are un-Islamic and anti-society, referring to such terrorists as ‘Islamic’ terrorists would be a misnomer. 

<!-- It ultimately would be a fallacy since even terrorist groups are mini-societies themselves. 

It would be like calling a bacteria that killed other bacteria as an 'anti-bacteria bacteria'. Instead, we call it as an 'antibiotic'.  -->

Terrorist attacks are based on a blind belief propagated by the founders of those terrorist societies. 

For example, Osama Bin Laden propounded a wrong belief that terrorist attacks would drive Americans out of the Middle East. 

In reality, the 9/11 attacks caused the American soldiers to flock into Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003.
- It even caused his own death in 2011 through a US Navy Seal attack. 

In the end, Bin Laden’s belief left everyone — himself, his friends and foes, Muslims and Americans alike — worse off.  

Clearly, if he knew his own interest and could either look deeply into the root causes of his anger or have foresight of its consequences, then his mind would’ve never created such a belief in the first place. 

If he could connect his idea of smashing airplanes onto tall buildings (`Idea 1`) with the idea of revenge against the US (`Idea 2`) that would hurt both himself and Islam in the end (`Idea 3`), then he would not have done what he did. 

David Hume knew that most humans have a weak ability to connect effect with ultimate causes, and causes with their long-term effects.

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Simplified Essays by David Hume, Commerce" >}}
Shallow thinkers tend to decry even those of solid understanding, abstruse thinkers, metaphysicians, and refiners. They call anything that is beyond their own weak conceptions as unjust.
{{< /q >}}


**Thus, those who blame terrorism on Islam is suffering from the same weakness that caused the terrorist to do his attack in the first place.** They do not see that jihad was meant to keep Muslims within Islam and never to terrorize others:


{{< q a="Mohammad" c="Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah">}}
<sup>216</sup> Fighting is ordained for you, even though you dislike it. <sup>217</sup> Say, “Fighting during the Holy Month is deplorable. But to bar others from Allah’s path, and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people from it, are more deplorable to Allah. Persecution is more serious than killing. They will not stop fighting you until they turn you back from your religion.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- Jihad is ordained for you though you dislike it. They will turn you back from [Islam]. Whoever turns back from [Islam] will [go to hell] -->

This is a self-defense measure to keep Islam intact amidst all the rival philosophies going around. **The best solution is not to attack Islam and to let Muslims get the good and bad consequences of their beliefs.**

## The Solution: A New Term Called ‘Dogmism’

The cycle of extermism can be broken by dealing directly with the root cause, which is the suffering experienced by the extremist. 

In Bin Laden's case, it was the pain of seeing American troops in the Middle East. It would be naive to think that the US can be requested to leave their oil interests totally to the Arabs. 

Since in this case, the root cause cannot be fixed, we have to limit the damage by separating Bin Laden's terrorism from Islam, Arabs, and even Saudi Arabia.  

 <!-- separating the idea of terrorism from the idea of Islam. The former arises from extreme shallow feelings caused by a heightened ego. The latter is its opposite, trying to make such strong egos submit to a unifying idea called Allah.  -->

Instead of attaching the word 'terrorism' to 'Islam', we replace it with the word 'dogmism' as a container for shallow-minded extremist beliefs. We then attach it to its proponent or founder so that the attacks by Al-Qaeda are part of **Bin Laden’s Dogmism**.

His dogmism is similar to, but a bit different from, that of ISIS which we can call **Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi’s Dogmism**. 

Notice that in both dogmisms, the word ‘Islam’ or ‘Muslim’ is never encountered. 

Another example is Hitler’s final solution of killing all Jews in Europe, which we can call **Hitler’s Dogmism**. This avoids reference to 'Socialism' which is part of the Nazi name. 

Lastly, we call Trump's policy of blaming election loss as cheating by the opposition as **Trump's Dogmism**. This separates it from the Republican party and white people. 

<!-- The word 'dogmism' adds a negative connotation so that 'Trump's Dogmism' is negative, but 'Trumpism' might be neutral of positive.  -->

In this way, the root cause can be easily traced to the originators of the blind belief, such as Bin Laden, Baghdadi, Hitler, and Trump, isolating them from Muslims, Arabs, Germans, and Republicans respectively.

<!-- Since human minds are commonly ‘vulgar’ or shallow and unphilosophical, then the best solution to terrorism is to isolate the conflict to the parties involved and leave everyone else out of it. Humans naturally get angry and some humans might lose control like animals if they do not have the proper moral, philosophical or social education or training. Rather than name such blind-belief-based-conflicts as ‘Islamic’ terrorism, it would be more proper to call it under the blanket term as ‘Dogmism’ which refers to conflicts or problems based on blind, irrational, or vulgar beliefs. Each family or genus of Dogmism will then have its own specific species. -->

The public will then connect the terrorist attacks to the proponents themselves instead of onto a whole religion, race, country, etc.

Once the whole world knows about the specific flavor of that dogma and its proponent, then the world can simply find solutions against that person and the causes behind such a flavor of dogmism.


<!-- The science behind this solution is in metaphysics, specifically in the theory that ideas have the same dynamics as viruses. Viruses are everywhere, but they only infect those with frail bodies and weak natural immune systems. Likewise, bad ideas are everywhere, but normally, people have strong or rational minds and have good educational systems to make them immune. However, in some cases minds become weakened or damaged and education becomes perverted, making it easy for bad ideas to take root in the mind, such as during the spread of Communist ideas in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia 50 years ago when those areas were battered by World War II and the Cold War. -->

- Noun: Dogmism
- Person: Dogmist
- Adjective: Dogmistic
- Adverb: Dogmistically

Examples:
- "Trump dogmists attacked the US Capitol in an effort to reverse the election results."
- "The dogmists of Imperial Japan resolved to attack Pearl Harbor in 1941."
<!-- - The etnic cleansing in Rwanda is clearly dogmistic.  -->
- "He dogmistically rejected the job application of the gay black man."


## What makes an idea of belief dogmatic?

The key attribute that makes an idea of belief dogmatic is the overstrength of the Negative Force. This is explained in the Superphysics principles.

The easiest way to detect the Negativity of an idea or belief is simply the bad feeling of it. 

But since feeling is subjective, the best way is to see the effect of an idea of belief in the long term and compare them with some control that has an opposite feeling.
