After Enki led the Jews out of Egypt, he gave Moses a lot of laws up on Mount Sinai. The most important was to worship only Enki and not other alien-gods like his elder brother Enlil. 

This is because Enki was totally insecure and jealous after losing command of Earth to Enlil.  

In the ancient Egyptian religion:
- Enlil is Ra
- Enki is Sobek


To get legitimacy for these laws, Enki demonstrated his power to the Israelites through cloud, lightning, thunder, trumpets, and earthquakes (Exodus 19). 

While waiting for Moses to come down from Mount Sinai, the Israelites decided to worship Enki through a golden calf made by Aaron. But none of them knew that the calf really represented Enlil!

This made Enki extremely mad that he wanted to destroy all the Israelites and start over with just Moses. But Moses pleaded: Enki went to so much trouble to lead the Israelites out of Egypt only to destroy them all on a mountain -- what a waste!

So Enki changes his plan and Moses rushes down the mountain, shocked and fuming mad that the Israelites are worshipping Enlil. He destroys the calf and asks who among them is on the side of Enki. 

The loyalist Levites come up and Moses orders them to kill all 3,000 partisans of Enlil.

With Enlil's influence totally purged and eliminated from the people, Judaism takes root through Enki's laws given through Moses.

All this time, Enki keeps on bashing the Jews for their many mistakes and always threatens to destroy them. 

This attitude of Enki goes on throughout, not only in the Old Testament, but even continues in the Quran where he speaks to Mohammad as "Allah" (so far, his names have been Enki, Ea, Yahweh, and Allah). 

The main difference is that in the Quran, Enki favors Ishmael (the father of the Arabs) whereas in Genesis, he favored Jacob. 

By 600 AD, Enki has probably realized that he should have invested in Ishmael's genetic line instead of Jacob's. 

And so through the Prophet Mohammad, Enki starts anew and gives so many laws all over again, creating Islam.


The Muslims are therefore the last true human allies of Enki.
