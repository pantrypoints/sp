<!-- What a shallow article from shallow research. -->

"Following your passion" is not a uniquely Western philospohy. It is a natural concept. 

It was first documented in Taoism, then in the Gita.

The Asian passion isn't based on blind desire of the West, but on Dharma or the Tao which is a metaphysical concept lacking in the West. 

Since it is natural, it was documented in the West too.

In Plato's Republic it was as δικία which was unfortunately translated as "justice". 

This is why the entire Republic by Plato is all about Dharma. This is proven by the last part which is about reincarnation -- you reincarnate based on your dharma. 

So there is no disconnect between Enlightened Greek and Enlightened Asian systems. 

The "research" is merely citing CONFUCIANISM where Singaporean = Chinese. 

It is Confucianism that corrupts the Tao or Dharma just as Catholicism corrupts reincarnation by removing it. 

In the Taoist and Vedic systems, you choose your passion as your class in society: shudra, ksattriya, brahmin, or vaesya. 

In this way, you go with people who have the same passions as you, and so your civlization attains golden ages.

But evil creeps in after golden ages and so the class system becomes rigid -- Confucianism crept in to kill the Tao just as Catholicism crept in to kill δικία.

This is what the "research" sees in Singaporeans. 

So the "research" just merely propagates the same dumb ignorance by concluding that "following your passion is a culturally specific value system that prioritises individual autonomy over pragmatism"

So it advocates to kill your dharma for the sake of security -- exactly the opposite of the way of nature.

The correct advocacy is to find out your true passion as early as possible. If you are a parent, help your kids know their dharma.

As they enter high school and college guide them to what course matches their dharma. 

Then they will naturally excel in that degree and in that job and get the security as an EFFECT of that passion and not as a rival of it.
