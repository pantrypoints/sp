<!-- The start of the new year is usually the time for creating resolutions or things that we resolve to do or achieve.  

A New Year's resolution that we can all do is to have a healthier diet. Here I write the benefits of vegetarian diets for health and spirituality.

A proper and healthy diet is not only essential for good health and avoiding painful diseases like cancer, migraines, arthritis, digestion, and urinary problems. 

It is also a key requirement of the spiritual practice, as the vegetarian diet. 

Meat and fish have higher energy which are converted to fat. It is this fat that creates problems:
- fat in the blood causes high blood pressure and stroke
- fat in the heart and lungs causes fatigue
- fat in the abdomen leads to impotence and reduces fertility

High-sugar foods lead to an oversupply of sugar which cannot be assimilated by the liver. This causes the sugar to pollute the blood, leading to diabetes which causes:
- cataracts
- bodily discomfort 
- headache and dizziness
- frequent urination

Vegetarian diets avoid meat and fish while reducing sugar and protein intake.  

We can classify vegetarian diets as either spiritual or non-spiritual. 


## Spiritual

The spiritual ones are based on the rules given by respective Masters, with the most common ones being from South Asia. These are essential in mental and spiritual practices by avoiding the negative vibrations in non-vegetarian food. 


1. Jain Vegetarian Diet

This is a strictly vegetarian diet that avoids all forms of animal products, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.

The main difference is that Jains avoid root vegetables (like onions, garlic, and potatoes) because harvesting them kills the entire plant, which goes against the principle of non-violence.

Food must be prepared with care to avoid contamination with microorganisms, reflecting a commitment to non-harm.

Another key feature is that Jains do fasting or have specific dietary restrictions during religious observances.


2. Buddhist Vegetarian Diet

Strict Buddhists adhere to vegetarianism.

Some traditions allow meat when it is offered.

Most Buddhists avoid specific foods, such as garlic and onions, due to their bad effects on meditation and mindfulness.


3. Hindu Vegetarian Diet

This avoids fish, eggs, and meat, especially beef. 

Like Buddhists, they avoid specific foods, such as garlic and onions.

Like Jains, they do fasting or have specific dietary restrictions on certain days.


## The Non-Spiritual

These are vegetarian diets that focus mainly on health benefits instead of avoiding negative vibrations. 

1. Lacto-Vegetarian

This allows dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt but avoids meat, fish, and eggs. This is common in cultures that incorporate dairy into their traditional diets.

2. Ovo-Vegetarian

This includes eggs but avoids dairy products. This is often done to add protein and other nutrients in eggs. 


3. Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian

This is the most common type of vegetarian diet. This allows both dairy products and eggs but avoids meat and fish. This makes it easier to meet nutritional needs.


4. Vegan

This focuses on plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

It avoids all animal products, including meat, fish, dairy, and eggs.

This is second-most difficult of the vegetarian diets. I have seen vegan Westerners unable to eat anything during events because none of the foods are vegan i.e. they all have some eggs or milk. 


5. Raw Vegetarian and Fruitarian

This allows only raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Foods are unprocessed and not heated above a certain temperature (often 104°F to 118°F).

This is highly restrictive and can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not carefully managed.

This is the most difficult vegetarian diet. I have only seen this practiced in wellness centers as the prescribed diet for certain patients undergoing treatment for certain diseases.
