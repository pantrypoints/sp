When I was a teenager, I felt that non-Christians like Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, etc were silly for not accepting Jesus as their Savior. Jesus had done everything, so why do the non-Christians still not believe?

But in my 20s, I noticed that Catholic practice was not leading to any spiritual progress -- its marginal spiritual utility was flattening to zero. 

At this point, Catholics usually upgrade to charismatic movements, do intense bible study, or switch to Evangelical, Born Again sects. 

In my case, I switched to the Asian systems (Hinduism as Yoga, and Buddhism as Zen) and immediately got the progress that I was looking for, especially upon getting low-level samadhi and a glimpse of a few siddhis. 

I realized that I should have switched much earlier. Even at its simplest form, the Asian systems push for a vegetarian diet which is scientifically healthier and better for the planet. 

More importantly, they have an ultimate prize called nivikalpa samadhi that leads to a state of moksha, which make even the greatest siddhis insignificant. 

Its Christian version is "The Pearl of Great Price" -- a businessman gives up everything that he has just to get that one Pearl. 

The difference is that the Asian systems have the process down to a precise science, in a step-by-step manner.

Buddha was a wealthy prince who gave up everything to get moksha, as nirvana. 

His main contribution was to clear up the cobwebs of Hindu practices that became elitist and calcified because of its sheer age, and to keep dharma turning again.

Gladly would we let the flesh & blood in our bodies dry up, leaving just the skin, tendons, & bones, but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness, human persistence, human striving, there will be no relaxing our persistence.
