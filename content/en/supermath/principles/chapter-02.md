A number is an instance of an identity. 

"Instance" is Latin *instantia*, meaning presence. This is consistent with our perception-based Superphysics. 

We use 'vortex' number since in Cartesian Physics, absolutely everything is a spinning vortex. And so each instance automatically has a spin. 

This makes it 'alive' but not expressive. This concept is totally absent in Mathematics which just thinks of instances as dead quantities. 

Dead and Alive are key characteristics of the Physics of Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley for an infinite living universe with dormant sections:

{{< q a="George Berkeley" >}}
**No force is immediately perceived by itself.** It is only known and measured by its effects. But the *dead force*, or simple gravitation in a body at rest, produces no observable change and hence no effect. 

But impact does. Therefore, since forces are proportional to their effects, then dead force is null.

## Instance of Identity

We can say that:
- 1 potato is one instance of a potato-identity. 
- 4 potatoes are 4 instances of a potato. 

{{< i s="/photos/objects/potatoes.jpg" a="Potatoes" >}}

Sometimes, numbers are used by themselves without any physical object. 

For example `1 + 1 = 2` uses pure instances. It adds 1 instance to another instance to come up with 2 instances. 

The mind assigns a new identity or name to this "2-instance instance" as the number 2. 

There are an infinite number of instances, and so the mind would have to assign new identities to each instance, which is then has to remember.

Since the mind's memory capacity is finite, it groups the identities into repeatable patterns using the same base identities. 

- This is also why **Supermath** is for numbers that represent physical reality, from the Material to the Spatial Layer. This uses all base-x groupings.
- **Qualimath** is for instances that represent the metaphysical domain such as ideas and feelings, including the idea of infinity. This uses base-3 grouping.

Humans have settled for base-10 as its grouping. For example, instead of writing arbitrary symbols up to infinity such as:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 𝄞, 𝄢, 𝄬, 𝄮, 𝅘𝅥,..
```

We could simply reuse the names of the identities by grouping them into 10:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15..
```

This makes sense since humans have 10 fingers. So each finger represents an instance of identity.


### Base 6

But since there are 5 Elements and not 10, it's better to use base-6

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21..
```

But this is confusing to people who have been used to base-10. So we use totally different symbols for the numbers based on the keyboard:

```
!, @, #, $, %, !0, !@, !#, !$, !%, @0, @1..
```

In this way, `! + ! = @`.

Vortex numbers are base-6 instances that can:
- make geometry easier and less irrational
- explain the relationship between the constants

An easy way to scale the numbers was one of the innovations of the metric system. However, you will notice that there are missing names for some groupings such as between picometer and femtometer. 

We fill these gaps with a prefixes that use the numbers. In this way, people don't have to memorize arbitrary names such as milli, micro, kilo, mega, etc.
