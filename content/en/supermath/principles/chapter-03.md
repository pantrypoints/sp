Instances are the perceptions of unique identity. 

The 4 Operations are:

1. Addition of Instances

2. Reduction of Instances 

This is called subtraction in arithmetic

3. Expansion of Instances

This is called multiplication

4. Contraction of Instances

This is called division


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Geometry" >}}
All Arithmetic is composed of only four or five operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Extraction of roots

The last can be considered as a type of Division.

## Francis Bacon Tables for Operations

Since flow is the highest action of the aether, and memory the lowest, we organize the instances into a table which the mind can flow along. 


1. Addition

`+` | 1 | 2
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3
2 | 3 | 4


2. Reduction

`-` | 1 | 2
--- | --- | ---
1 | 0 | 1
2 | -1 | 0


3. Expansion

`*` | 1 | 2
--- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | 2
2 | 2 | 4


3b. Self-Expansion (Exponents) in base 6

`*` | 2 | 4 | 12
--- | --- | --- | ---
2 | 4 | 12 | 24



4. Contraction (in base 6)

`/` | 1 | 2
--- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | 2
2 | 0.3 | 4
