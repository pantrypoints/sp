A fractal is an infinitely complex geometric shape with a repeating pattern that is self-similar across different scales.

If you zoom in on a part of a fractal, it will look similar to the whole image. 

Fractals are found in nature, such as in coastlines, snowflakes, and tree branches, and can be generated through repeating a simple mathematical process. 


## Dynamic Fractals Versus Static Shapes

Superphysics organizes everything into waves and nodes or particles.
- Waves are dynamic and continuous
- Nodes are static and discrete

We use shapes such as points, triangles, spheres, and pentagons for the static parts of Nature such as the 5 Elements. 

We use fractals which are repeating patterns within these shapes to show the dynamic effect of the 2 Forces persisting in Nature.
