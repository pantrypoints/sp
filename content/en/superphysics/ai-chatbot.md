We rank the different AI in terms of image generation, coding, and translation. 

## Images

Nano Banana is superior to Sora. We use our image with the prompt: *the woman is using her mobile her bed*

Gemini Nano Banana | Sora

## Translations

We use AI to translate a key chapter in Categories to see which one closely aligns with our interpretation. We find that Grok and Claude are more correct than the rest as they do not shallowly translate *differentiae* into *differences*. 



{{< l a="Aristotle" >}}
Tῶν ἑτερογενῶν καὶ μὴ ὑπ' ἄλληλα τεταγμένων ἕτεραι τῷ εἴδει καὶ αἱ διαφοραί, οἷον ζῴου [physical animal] καὶ ἐπιστήμης [metaphysical knowledge].

{{< r a="Superphysics" >}}
The diversity of classes [of ideas] that are not under one another are different in **essence**. For example, the class of animal [as idea] is different from [the idea] of **knowledge**.

<!-- The different classes that are not subordinate to one another are different in **essence**. For example, the difference between a physical animal and metaphysical **knowledge**. -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Grok" >}}
The **differentiae** of genera that are not under one another are different in <span style=color:red>kind</span>. For example, the differentiae of animal and of [metaphysical] **knowledge**.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Claude" >}}
Of things belonging to different genera and not subordinated one to another, the differentiae are themselves different in <span style=color:red>kind</span>. For example, the differentiae of animal and knowledge are different.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Gemini" >}}
[Fast] Of different genera that are not subordinate to one another, the differences are different in <span style=color:red>kind</span>. For example, the <span style=color:red>differences</span> of 'animal' and [metaphysical] '**knowledge**'.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="ChatGPT" >}}
Of things that are of different genera and are not arranged under one another, their differences are different in <span style=color:red>kind</span>. For example, animal and [metaphysical] **knowledge**.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Deepseek" >}}
For genera that are different and not subordinate one to the other, their differentiate are also different in <span style=color:red>species</span>. For example, ‘animal’ and ‘knowledge’.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Edghill" >}}
If genera are different and <span style=color:red>co-ordinate</span>, their differentiae are themselves different in <span style=color:red>kind</span>. Take as an instance the genus 'animal' and the genus 'knowledge'. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Google Translate" >}}
Of the heterogeneous and not subordinate to each other, the differences are another to the <span style=color:red>species</span>, which are of life and <span style=color:red>science</span>.

<!-- Εἶδος eidos specific essence vs. Ποιότης (Poiotēs - "Quality") vs Γένος (Genos) general -->


<!-- The superphysics translation is consistent with the other translation of τῶν δέ γε ὑπ' ἄλληλα γενῶν οὐδὲν κωλύει τὰς αὐτὰς διαφορὰς εἶναι· τὰ γὰρ ἐπάνω τῶν ὑπ' αὐτὰ γενῶν κατηγορεῖται, ὥστε ὅσαι τοῦ κατηγορουμένου διαφοραί εἰσι, τοσαῦται καὶ τοῦ ὑποκειμένου ἔσονται into: "On the other hand, the same essences belong to the classes that under one another. For the higher classes are superior to the lower ones, so that as many diverse essences that belong to the subordinate classes will also belong to their superior class." 

In this way, the whole paragraphs are translated to: When one thing is metaphysically subordinate to another thing thing, just as object is the predicate of a subject, then the qualities of that thing will be present in the other thing also. For example, the idea of man in general is metaphysically subordinate to individual man as an idea, and animal as an idea is suboridate to man as an idea. Therefore, animal will be metaphysically subordinate to the individual man, for the individual man is both a man and an animal, metaphysically.  The diversity of classes of ideas that are not under one another are different in essence. For example, the class of animal, as idea, is different from the idea of knowledge.
The idea of animal has subordinate diverse essence-ideas as terrestrial, two-footed, winged, aquatic. But none of these ideas is the essence of knowledge.
For one knowledge does not differ from another knowledge by being two-footed. 
On the other hand, the same essences belong to the classes that under one another. For the higher classes are superior to the lower ones, so that as many diverse essences that belong to the subordinate classes will also belong to their superior class.
