Metaphysics, as a subset of philosophy, was corrupted into Epistemology because of Kant through his a priori fallacy.
- This fallacy is a non-problem that was solved by the useless tool called Epistemology. 

This is similar to how Aristotle corrupted logic into Ontology through the invention of syllogism. 


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 5" >}}
When Metaphysics and Physics became subservient to theology [via Ontology], the duties of human life were treated as subservient to the afterlife. In this way, Metaphysics became the most corrupted science.
{{< /q >}}


Both Ontology and Epistemology deal with the formation of knowledge. But this was already addressed by 3 sciences:

1. Metaphysics (Pneumatics)
2. Physics
3. Logic

- `Physics + Logic` dealt with the visible world. 
- `Metaphysics + Logic` dealt with the invisible world. 

<!-- Anciently, Metaphysics was called . It is merely Physics for invisible things.  -->


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Wealth of Nations, Book 5" >}}
Physics was gradually extended and divided into Physics and Metaphysics or Pneumatics.
{{< /q >}}


Pneumatics is the study of the invisible aerial *pneuma* which is the same as chi in Taoism and Vayu in Yoga.


<!-- Dialectics was the most important part of Socrates' philosophy, of which the Socratic dialogue is the only part that is understood by academics. 

Its most important parts are the metaphysical principles that he established, such as:
- the immortality of the soul and its reincarnation
- the pantheist God (Brahma) as the source of all souls 
- the superiority of the metaphysical over the physical
- and so on

Nowadays, people think of dialectics as merely an exercise in logic, without any reference to metaphysical truths, the Supreme, or problem-solving. The culprits are the 19th century philosophers led by Kant who corrupted metaphysics. -->

 <!-- established a corrupted version of a priori knowledge.  -->


<!-- Unlike Socratic knowledge which aimed for a practical or moral purpose, Kant's knowledge is derived for the sake of exercising the brain. It would be like running around in circles uselessly just for the experience of running. -->


## Kant Corrupts the Science of Knowledge

Like the 18th century philosophers, Kant divides all knowledge as experiential (a posteriori), and non-experiential (a priori). 

Traditionally:
- **a priori** means 'before experience'
  - Omniscience, prediction, prophecy, and intuition all fall under this, because you know something in advance before it actually happens
  - This is the effect of the higher mind or *Mahat* in Hinduism
  - This is what Ontolgy is supposed to deal with
- **a posteriori**  means 'after experience'
  - This is how we normally know things -- by experiencing them, either directly (as in seeing things) or indirectly (as in education or someone else telling you what they saw or know)
  - This is the effect of the lower mind or *Aham* in Hinduism. Both *Mahat* and *Aham* form *citta* or mind-stuff. In other words, `mind = lower mind + higher mind`
  - This is what Epistemology is supposed to deal with


However, Kant corrupts the word a priori by defining it as **perceptions that are confined to the mind** and a posteriori as outside the mind. 

{{< q a="Kant" c="Introduction, Critique of Pure Reason" >}}
Our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the mind supplies from itself.. Knowledge altogether independent of experience and sensuous impressions is called a priori, in contradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources a posteriori, that is, in experience.
{{< /q >}}


To Kant:
- the within-the-mind mental activities manifest as intutional or passive-thinking
- the outside-the-mind mental activities manifest as active-thinking
  - This connects impressions with each other, even with those ideas that are within the mind. 


{{< q a="Kant" c="Introduction, Critique of Pure Reason" >}}
All judgements with a subject and predicate is done in 2 ways. Either the predicate `B` belongs to subject `A` or the predicate `B` lies completely out of the conception `A` although still connected. In the first instance, I term the judgement analytical, in the second, synthetical. 

Analytical judgements have the connection of the predicate with the subject cogitated through identity.

Those in which this connection is cogitated without identity are called synthetical judgements. The former may be called explicative, the latter augmentative judgements.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- he makes a very subtle but corrupting addition that **a priori knowledge is that not experienced by onself, but may be experienced by others.** -->

<!-- {{< q a="Kant" c="Introduction, Simple Critique of Pure Reason, emphasis added" >}}
Is there knowledge and sensory impressions that exist without being experienced? This knowledge is called a priori. This is in contrast to experiential or a posteriori knowledge based on experience. But a priori is not as yet definite enough. Experiential knowledge might be known a priori, because we do not derive this knowledge immediately from experience,but from a general rule which we have borrowed from experience [OF OTHER PEOPLE].
{{< /q >}} -->


So we can simplify Kant's words as follows:

Kant | Layman
--- | ---
A priori | Within-the-mind or Confined-to-mind
A posteriori | Outside-the-mind
Analytical judgement | Passive-Thinking (autopilot)
Synthetical judgement | Active-Connective-Thinking (manual effort) 


This simplifies the statement:

> Geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically, and yet à priori.

into:

> Geometry determines the properties of space through active-thinking, yet confined-to-the-mind.

Much easier, huh?

Kant then combines these concepts to create the metaphysical question:

{{< q a="Kant" c="Introduction, Critique of Pure Reason" >}}
How are synthetical judgements a priori possible?
{{< /q >}}


In other words, Kant asks: **How does the mind think?**

But this question has been fully solved and answered by the pre-Aristotle Greek sciences and by the Asian sciences:

Greek Science or Mechanism | Asian Science or Mechanism
--- | ---
Metaphysics | Mahat or higher mind
Logic | Aham or lower mind
Physics | Citta or mind-stuff


<!-- This has already been solved by the Asian sciences through the dynamics of the atman, mahat, aham, citta, lokas, samskara, etc.  -->

Both the ancient Greeks and Asians have already realized that the world was not real.

And so their goal was to **stop the thinking process** by uniting their minds with the Supreme Mind who was already omniscient and didn't need to think. 

<!-- Basically, the impressions from the lower (aham) and higher minds (mahat) are assembled in the mind-stuff (citta) to be experienced by the soul (atman) acccording to its configuration (samskara).   -->


<!-- So Kant's "a priori knowledge" is really "a-posteriori-knowledge-from-others". 

It would be calling a man who has decided to become a female as a 'woman' just because that's how he wants to be seen. But the word 'woman' does not really match the man's nature and is false or a sophistry.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/shemale.jpg" alt="Shemale person" cap="Weird.">}}


Fallacies and lies do not support themselves and need to be supported by other fallacies in a chain. Kant supports the a priori fallacy by adding the idea of pure and impure a priori.

{{< q a="Kant" >}}
A priori knowledge is either pure or impure. Pure a priori knowledge has no empirical element.
{{< /q >}}

This makes something non-empirical as somewhat empirical. Refering to our man-woman example, this is like calling the man as an 'impure woman' instead of calling him as a man. -->


## Kant's Corruption of How the Mind Thinks: Mathematics

The big problem was that both Aristotle and Kant were intellectuals. It is the nature of intellectuals to keep on thinking. 

So instead of realizing the existence of a Supreme Mind that can end the thiking process, both Kant and Aristotle enshrine logic as the top science: 


Correct Science or Mechanism | Aristotle | Kant
--- | --- | ---
Metaphysics | none | none 
Logic | Ontology (via syllogisms) | Transendence or Pure Reason (via Mathematics) 
Physics | Physics | Physics  



<!-- The proper understanding of the soul and its connection to the Supreme, as the totality of all possible physical and metaphysical experiences, is essential in answering how the mind really thinks. 

The Asian sciences have this understanding because the Asian sages were superior to Western ones in detecting the upper Elements of high vibration as aether and spacetime (traditional air Element).
- The Western sages were superior in detecting the lower Elements of low vibration, as matter and electromagnetism (Earth and Fire Elements respectively).
- So Asia dominates Metaphysics and Philosophy just as the West dominates Physics and Science. 

Kant, as a Westerner, imposes shallow low-vibration principles in to high-vibration metaphysics by:  (i.e. the physical aspects of the Supreme)-->

To enshrine "transcendent logic" Kant: 

1. Blocks out the sensory world
2. Imposes his own arbitrary abstractions, formalizing them as principles 


This style is similar to Aristotle blockng out Plato's theory of metaphysical ideas to enshrine a theologistic God-substance.  



### You are Your Own Math-God

Abstractions work because each person is the god of his own mental universe. 

- Aristotle used logic + thoughts
- Kant used logic + numbers (as math) i.e. Mathematics is relational logic using numbers

<!-- The 2 systemic mental processes are logic and mathematics*.  -->

Everyone is free to connect numbers in their own minds as equations, just as everyone is free to ramble with thoughts and connect them to each other. 

**But whether these abstract number and thoughts work in reality is a sign of how a mind is attuned to reality.**

<!-- n="How strong or close is the relation between the personal soul with the Soul of the Physical Unverse, as an aspect of the Supreme. People how are disconnected with reality are called crazy and seen as bad, not good." -->


{{< q a="Kant" >}}
Pure reason succeeds in the sphere of mathematics. It leads to the expectation that the mathematical method can be applied to other regions of mental endeavour. In this way, it can make itself a master over nature.
{{< /q >}}


Before Kant's time, the experts in causality were priests. Thanks to Kant, the false experts are now mathematicians. 

This is proven by the priest-physicist Lemaitre who pegged the cause of the universe to a Big Bang, made acceptable because it matches the math of the day. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/ccc.jpg" a="CCC" c="Penrose, who advanced the CCC Theory, is like a priest describing how God created the universe. Both priest and mathematician are slaves to their imaginations. The priest is a slave to the rules in the Bible. The mathematician is a slave to the rules of constants and math operators. Both do hacks to make their propositions seem realistic or believable" >}}

<!-- {{< q a="Einstein" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. He as two mirrors inclined at 90° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time If he sees the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous [happen at the same time]. You object by saying that "time" would only be "simultaneity" if light travels at a constant speed, but the speed of light is measured by time. You would say this is reasoning in a circle and therefore, simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light. I answer that this simultaneity of time is only used for us to make empirical decisions.

## Kant's Corruption of How the Mind Thinks: Epistemology

<!-- and the senses -->
Kant's separation of reality from the thinking process mixes up the following metaphysical objects and structures:
- knowledge
- facts-from-memory
- opinions
- beliefs


All of these are a priori or within-the-mind:
- knowledge and facts are demonstrative and real
- opinions and beliefs may or may not be real

<!-- ![Mixed fruits](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/mixed.jpg) -->

<!-- The problem is that it **corrupts the definition of knowledge and facts** by mixing it, like mixed fruit, with opinions and beliefs: -->


To solve this non-problem, academics had to create "Epistemology" which is supposed to re-separate fact from opinion. 
- This then adds unnecessary effort when the whole problem could have been avoided **by not mixing up fact and opinion in the first place**. 

The mix-up could be prevented by simply classifying which metaphysical object was sensory and which was not.
- To further strengthen this classification process, the ancient Greek invented the tool of dialectics. 

Let's say you get an idea to increase sales in your company. You are not sure whether it is correct or not. 

- A common-sense person would ask his colleague immediately whether his idea would work. The colleague would then answer 'yes' or 'no' as a fact
  - 'Yes' means the idea had a match with reality
  - 'No' means it had no match
- But a Kantian would keep on developing that sales-idea in his own mind into a million-dollar campaign with huge sales projections even if it had *zero reality* (because the goal is the thinking process and not any real effects) 


The failed sales-idea would then prompt you to find out why your idea failed. It might lead you to ask: "How does the mind think?"
- This would lead to the false science of Epistemology.
- Academics and intellectuals would then create courses on useless epistemology to give employment to themselves and to appease people who didn't have the common sense to ask the world to verify their ideas.*

{{< n n="From here, we can make a hypothesis that epistemology and ontology people are generally introverts,  have few friends, not into sales and public relations and public speaking, and not the life of a party. These are associated with the Saturn and Luna palmistry mounts. They are definitely not Jupiter nor Apollo." >}}



<!-- The original tool to split fact from opinion is called dialectics.  -->

{{< i s="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/flip300.jpg" a="Flipping burgers" c="The uselessness of epistemology is seen in epistemologists flipping burgers" >}}


This same problem afflicts modern Physics which created useless theories like Supersymmetry, Loop Quantum Gravity, and String Theory.

{{< q a="Kant" c="Preface" >}}
Mathematics and physics are the two theoretical sciences which have to determine their objects a priori. The former is purely a priori, the latter is partially so
{{< /q >}}


<!-- ## The Cause of Kant's Corruption: Ego

The common flaw with failed theorists is that their ideas are based on their own ego, which has a limited view of reality. 

Kant got triggered by the genious of David Hume who explained how the mind works by connecting ideas and impressions. 

Hume did not give details of the Supreme Cause of how the mind works because he never had any Asian sage tell him how the upper Elements work. 

But Kant, fueled by ego, foolishly pushes forward and enshrines imagination as the cause. This has led to seemingly advanced concepts, such as those used in theoretical physics (such Relativity and Yang Mills), but are actually useless.  -->

<!-- i s="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/kantmarxcrop.jpg" a="Kant and Marx" c="High ego seems to be a German theme as proven by Freud, Kant, Marx, and Hitler"


The overstrength of the ego is addressed by spirituality which is the expertise of the Asian sciences, not of Western religion.
