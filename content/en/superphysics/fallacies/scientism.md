We define scientism as the belief that science, with its 5-sense limitation, explains all of Nature. 

This is because in reality there are more than 5 senses. Some humans have more than 5, while most are limited to 5. 

Imagine an expert caveman hunter-gatherer applying that process to a newbie caveman planter or agriculturist:


{{< l a="Planter" >}}
I propose a new way to have food through agriculture
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Hunter" >}}
Are you an expert in hunting-gathering?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Planter" >}}
No.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Hunter" >}}
So you have no right to push agriculture over hunting-gathering. Have you verified that farming produces food?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Planter" >}}
Not yet. I just got the seeds here, with the new idea to grow lots of them by caring for them and not eating them immediately.
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Hunter" >}}
Hunting-gathering has produced so much food for a long time. So you have no right to try your untested agriculture when hunting-gathering already works. Moreover, if you put your untested agriculture to mass consensus, public opinion will favor me, not you.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Planter" >}}
But you just want to nip agriculture at the bud to protect your own hunting-gathering business.
{{< /l >}}




{{< r a="Hunter" >}}
Hunting-gathering has been proven, Agriculture is new and has not been proven. You should stop planting and instead should join the hunting team. 

We use the seeds to bait the birds and other animals. So don't waste them by burying them back to the ground. 

You are not an expert on food. We are.
