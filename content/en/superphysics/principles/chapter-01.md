There are 2 Domains in Existence | Physical and Metaphysical Domain
{{< /b >}}


{{< youtube TpN23dGFcSA>}}

We know the existence of thing through our perceptions of it. Each perception has 2 aspects:

1. Physical
2. Metaphysical

For example, when we see a mug, we have both the physical perception of a mug and a metaphysical idea of a mug nearly at the same time. 

{{< i s="/photos/objects/mugecon.jpg" alt="Mug Economics" c="A physical mug exists in physical reality just as the idea of a mug exists in metaphysical reality">}}

{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics Simplified, Part 2, Proposition 7" >}}
The two are one and the same thing displayed through different attributes:
1. A circle existing in nature
2. The idea of a circle existing
{{< /q >}}



## The Two Domains

This means that the mug exists in two domains of reality:

1. The physical mug exists in the physical domain, which we see and touch. 
  - This mug is made of glass.

2. The metaphysical mug exists in the metaphysical domain, as our idea of what a mug is. 
  - This mug-idea is made of aether.
  - Unlike the physical mug which we can see and touch, this aethereal mug-idea can only be perceived by our abstract minds.



{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Nova Organum, Book 2" >}}
Let the investigation of forms, which are eternal and immutable, constitute metaphysics. Let the investigation of the efficient cause of matter, constitute physics.
{{< /q >}}

### The Physical Domain

This domain exists only because of our physical senses, most commonly by our sight and touch which are really 'electromagnetic' types of perception. This will make sense when we talk about the 5 Layers of Reality.

Our senses let us perceive the mug physically by receiving the sensations of light and touch that **bounce back to them**. 
- Invisible and intangible objects are those that **do not let sensations of light or touch bounce back**. 
  - An example is the air which lets light and our hands pass through.  


<!-- a="Francis Bacon" c="Nova Organum" Humans should learn the difference between the idols of the human mind and the ideas of the divine mind. The former are mere arbitrary abstractions. The latter are the true marks of the Creator on his creatures, as they are imprinted on, and defined in matter, by true and exquisite touches. 

Truth and utility, therefore, are here perfectly identical. The effects are more valueable as pledges of truth rather than as practical benefits -->



### The Metaphysical Domain with Metaphysical Objects, as Ideas

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="The Interpretation of Nature, Chap 13" >}}
The schools by natural philosophy were meant for the knowledge of the efficients or things concrete; and by
metaphysics the knowledge of the forms of natures simple.
{{< /q >}}

This domain exists only because we have abstract minds which have an innate ability to 'house' or have ideas and thoughts.

- We are able to conceive an idea, or think of a thought, **if it bounces back in our minds onto our consciousness**.
- We are unable to have that idea or thought if it does not bounce back to our consciousness.

An example of a metaphysical object not bouncing back is when we forget a password to our email. 

The password was in our minds in the past. But our consciousness could not 'find' it because the effort that the mind exerts in remembering it does not bounce back with the actual password. 

It would be like querying a database without the query returning anything.

Another example is a problem that we have no solution for, such as:
- how to increase sales that are declining, or
- how to make a device work. 

In such cases, we think about the solution by:
- brainstorming, or
- tinkering with the device

Even then, the solution might still not reflect to our consciousness. 

The solution might finally reflect after we:
- ask our customers directly, or
- read the device's user manual. 

At that moment, our minds feel a relief since its effort can end. 

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Chapter 1" >}}
Aĺl men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses which are useful and loved for themselves.
{{< /q >}}
 <!-- The most important is the sense of sight. We prefer seeing over the other senses. -->


### The Metaphysical Domain Versus the Physical Domain

The metaphysical domain exists inside our abstract minds and is infinitely larger and richer than physical domain of our senses. 


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplifed, Book 9, Chapter 3" >}}
If Person A were to go from the lower to the middle region, he would imagine that he is going up. Person B is in the middle region but has never seen the true upper world. He sees Person A coming and imagines that he has arrived in the upper region. 
If Person A goes back down, Person B would imagine that he was descending. This would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions.
{{< /q >}}

We call this domain "aethereal" or made of aether or *akasha* in Hinduism. This will be explained later when we explain our Five Elements Model. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/cycle.svg" a="Venn Diagram" c="The metaphysical domain is much much larger than the physical domain despite having no physical size" >}}


{{< q a="Timaeus" c="Timaeus by Plato Simplifed">}}
These causes generate an inequality which is always maintained, and is continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements... The brightest part is called the aether. The most turbid sort is mist and darkness.
{{< /q >}}


These 3 regions of metaphysical domain, physical domain, and current perception (as a merger of both) are expressed in our Superphysics icon.

{{< img src="/icons/sp.png"  alt="Superphysics icon">}}

- The blue upward triangle reprsents the metaphysical domain going upwards
- The green downward triangle represents the physical domain going 'down to earth'
- The yellow circle represents the focus of the mind as the here and now, as a combination of both. This includes reality or the universe, depending on context

The balance of the triangles represents the balance between the abstract and the concrete. We can't focus on useless theory all the time. Nor can we go around doing physical actions without thinking of their causes and effects. 

Inaction leads to nothing. But haste, on the contrary, also makes waste. 

Human minds have limited abilities and so our focus must be relevant in order to maximize and concentrate what little we have. 

For example, as a species, it would be better to focus on solutions to global warming than to think of how to make more money, create a new cryptocurrency, or predict the stock market. The latter ideas are really based on selfish-interest instead of the common-interest.

<!-- The next chapter will explain the nature of ideas, which are the main objects in the metaphysical domain.  -->


## So what's the use of the 2 domains?

The 2 domains frees up the limitation of beliefs which includes:
- materialist sciences as belief in physical evidence, by allowing metaphysical evidence
- religion by replacing the definition of (Anunnaki) God into the (metaphysical) Supreme Entity which is far more permissive
- philosophy by establishing critical thinking and critical feeling
- mysticism by enshrining the superiority of the metaphysical domain   
- politics and social change and freeing up people from the rigid patterns of tyranny, capitalism or communism
- life events by freeing up the heart from the impositions from parents, society, employment, etc.  


## Definitions: Physical, Metaphysical

Physical is the nature of being detectable by the bodily senses. Technically, this is being part of the lower Elements or Layers such as the (Lower) Fire , Water, and Earth Elements, and the (Lower) Spatial, Convertible, and Material Layers. 

Metaphysical is the nature of being detectable by the abstract mind without the direct support of the bodily senses. Technically being part of the upper Elements such as the (upper) Fire, Air, and Aether Elements, and the (Upper) Spatial, and Aethereal Layers.


## Concepts Emerging from the 2 Domains

The concept of the 2 Domains leads to the following concepts:

1. Reality 
2. Abstract Spaces of Reality
3. Vortices and Ideas within Reality
4. Operational Divisions of Reality
5. The 5 Elements of Reality
