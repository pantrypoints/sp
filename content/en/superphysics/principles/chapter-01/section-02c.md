## Metaphysics Causes Physics

Section 1 explained that metaphysics causes physical phenomena. 

This was the inherent foundation of pre-scientific Natural Philosophy.
- This was exhaustively explained by Aristotle as the **first cause** of all physical phenomena.

This framework is consistent with Asian Physics, where the cause is the metaphysical:
- **Tao** in Chinese philosophy
- **Brahma** in Hindu philosophy

For example, the Chinese invented gunpowder not through random experimentation but by **studying the dynamics of the Water Element**, which is part of the 5 Elements of the Tao (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water).

Material Superphysics calls the Water Element as the Convertible Layer. 
- Modern physics knows an aspect of the Water Element as the **Weak Force**. This is why neutrinos (associated with the Weak Force) are only revealed by liquids—a direct consequence of the metaphysical Water Element principle.

This demonstrates that metaphysical understanding led to practical technological breakthroughs that modern science later rediscovered through trial and error.


### Newton's Fatal Limitation: Mathematics Without Metaphysics

The big problem began with Isaac Newton. **Newton only knew Mathematics, not Metaphysics.**

This is why his system was **mathematically accurate**, describing how things move. But it was **ignorant of the metaphysical root causes**, why things move.

Newton gave us equations that predict motion without the understanding of the deeper causes. 

This is like having a recipe without understanding nutrition—it works, but you can't innovate beyond it or adapt it to changing tastes or shortages of supply.


### The Cost of Abandoning Metaphysics

By severing physics from metaphysics, modern science has trapped itself in a limited paradigm:

**Current technological ceiling:**
- Fossil fuels (chemical energy)
- Newtonian rockets (mechanical thrust)
- Material-based technology

**Blocked technologies:**
- Free energy (tapping metaphysical energy sources)
- Teleportation (manipulating metaphysical space)
- Levitation (understanding metaphysical gravity)
- Advanced propulsion (beyond material thrust)

Unless we want science to stay stuck at this level indefinitely, **science must be abolished and replaced with Natural Philosophy 2.0**.


Another flaw of modern science is that it causes **compartmentalized silo thinking** as an effect of the separation property of the Negative Force:
- Physicists don't study ethics
- Biologists don't study politics
- Chemists don't study philosophy
- Engineers don't study metaphysics

Each specialist knows their narrow field deeply but lacks understanding of how it connects to the whole.


## Natural Philosophy 2.0 as the Unified Approach

This is radically different from Natural Philosophy, where **Aristotle was an expert in**:
- **Physics** (natural phenomena)
- **Ethics** (human behavior and morality)
- **Logic** (reasoning and argumentation)
- **Politics** (governance and society)
- **Metaphysics** (first causes and reality)

Aristotle understood that these fields are **interconnected**—you cannot truly understand physics without understanding metaphysics, or ethics without understanding nature, or politics without understanding human nature.

This is consistent with:
- Taoism uniting spirituality, chemistry, and medicine
- Hinduism uniting spirituality, social policy, governance, astronomy, astrology, agriculture, and medicine

We bring back the natural, holistic paradigm and discipline of natural philosophy. 

- Materialists have appropriated and squatted on the word 'Science' to mean the study of knowledge that is limited to physial perceptions. And so we use the word "Superphysics" to denote the original Latin *science* or Greek *episteme*. 
- In this way, being called 'pseudoscience' doesn't mean anything just as calling Islam as pseduo-Christian (just because it also has Jesus) doesn't mean anything since Islam is totally different and was never a fork of Christianity (though Christanity is a fork of Judaism).

Natural Philosophy 2.0 means:

1. Restoring Metaphysics as Foundation

Physical phenomena emerge from metaphysical causes. Study the first principles, not just the mathematical descriptions.

2. Integrate Knowledge Domains

All knowledge, whether of ethics, society, economics, physics, chemistry, technology, etc all arise from the metaphysics of human understanding from the dynamics of the human soul. Advanced aliens have totally different dynamics but the same metaphysics and so have more advanced technologies and sciences yet might operate in the same reality. 

3. Enable Advanced Technologies

Human understanding can be upgraded to match advacned aliens so that we can have advanced technologies and not be stuck with Newtonian rockets or Eisnteinian nuclear weapons. 

<!-- By understanding metaphysical causes, we can develop:
- **Free energy** - by tapping the aether/Tao/Brahma
- **Teleportation** - by manipulating metaphysical space
- **Levitation** - by understanding gravity's metaphysical nature
- **Healing technologies** - by working with life force (chi/prana) -->

4. Train Polymaths, Not Specialists

Produce thinkers who are not rigid or have silo thinking, and can undestand:
- The metaphysical foundation (philosophy)
- The physical world (science)
- Human nature (psychology/ethics)
- Social organization (politics/economics)
- Practical application (technology/engineering)


This solves the many problems created by the scientific revolution of the 18th century:

- global warming from fossil fuels from being unable to tap free energy from the aether (vacuum energy)
- materialism in Capitalism and Communism (dialetical materialism) which has caused financial crises and Cold War
- World Wars from the fight between oligarchs (finance) and tyrants (military)
- rapid advance of science in the 18th century only to be hopelessly stuck by the 20th century
- environmental destruction from Capitalism


Superphysics is a version of Natural Philosophy 2.0 which we predict to be upgraded into Superphysics 2.0 when humans start exploring other galaxies. This will reveal new principles leading to Natural Philosophy 3.0. 

Name | Version
--- | ---
Natural Philosophy 1.0 | Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle, Democritus, etc.
Natural Philosophy 1.5 | Erasistratus, Ptolemy, Descartes
Natural Philosophy 2.0 | Superphysics 1.0
Natural Philosophy 3.0 | Superphysics 2.0
Natural Philosophy 4.0 | Humans become non physical and so knowledge wouldn't need to be assembled into science anymore


In this way, other people can make their own version of Natural Philosophy 2.0 that might not agree with the core principles of Superphysics. 

For example, Hindus refuse to connect Shiva-Shakti with Yang-Yin of the Taoists because it would mean that:
- the Chinese have improved on ideas originally from India
- Indian intellect has stagnated greatly when it was the origin of Asian enlightenment



<!-- ## Conclusion

The Chinese developed gunpowder by understanding the Water Element. They didn't need particle accelerators or quantum mechanics—they needed metaphysical insight into natural principles.

Modern science has achieved impressive mathematical precision but has lost the ability to access the deeper causes that would enable transformative technologies. 

Newton's mathematics without metaphysics has taken us as far as it can. To advance further—to achieve free energy, teleportation, and technologies that seem impossible under current paradigms—we must return to Natural Philosophy's integration of metaphysics and physics.

**Science must be abolished and replaced with Natural Philosophy 2.0**, not because science is wrong, but because it is incomplete. It's time to restore the understanding that physical phenomena have metaphysical causes, and that true knowledge requires integrating all domains of understanding.

The choice is clear: remain trapped in Newtonian limitations, or return to the natural philosophical tradition that produced breakthrough technologies by understanding the metaphysical foundations of physical reality. -->
