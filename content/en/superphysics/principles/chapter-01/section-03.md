{{< /b >}}



The previous section explained the 2 domains of reality as the physical and metaphysical.

Reality is an effect of perception. 

Perception is a disturbance in a line in the aether or akasha, which is the substance for existence. This is because existence exists as a thought-projection of the Supreme Mind as the Brahman which we call the Supreme Entity.

The resulting existence is called Brahma including visible, invisible, and physical, metaphysical.

For those who are allergic to religion and think that Brahma is a religious word, we can use the layman term **Totality of Existence**, or Existence with a capital 'e', instead. 


To know Itself, the Absolute Entity expresses ideas and feelings which then converts Itself into the Supreme Entity with an abstract space for that expression.  


## The Abstract Spaces

These abstract spaces are of 3 kinds:

1. **Existence Space**

This is the Supreme as a single collective of all identities in Existence. This is how the Supreme sees Itself.

This is called:
- Mahat in Hinduism
- Viñana in Buddhism

2. **Identity Space**

This is each thought or identity of the Supreme within Existence. This is how the Supreme sees each Identity in isolation.

This is called:
- Manas in Buddhism
- Aham in Hinduism

3. **Perception Space**

This is the space that results from the perception of the identities within Existence. This is how the identities see each other, without regard for the Supreme.

This is called Citta in Buddhism and Hinduism.
