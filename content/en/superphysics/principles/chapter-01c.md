The Natural View is Positive | Natural View
{{< /b >}}


The previous section exposed the materialist view as the dominant, but wrong view of reality and how the universe works. 

We correct this with a  natural holistic view of the universe as something that is infinite and eternal. 

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Heavens, Book 1, Chapter 10" >}}
The universe cannot be at once eternal and generated. To say that the universe alternately combines and dissolves is no more paradoxical than to make it eternal but varying in shape.
{{< /q >}}


The prevailing materialist mentality:
- downplays the imagination and the metaphysical domain
- enshrines materialism and the physical domain, such as through physical pleasures and comfort

The big problem is that:
- the physical body is finite in potentiality, limited and not eternal
- the metaphysical soul, as an abstract mind, is infinite in potentiality and eternal

The natural view is that the universe and reality are based on metaphysical perception as the unit mind being within the Supreme Mind.


{{< q a="Vasishtha" c="Yoga Vasishtha" >}}
The phenomenal world and your knowledge of egoism or self-existence are but erroneous conceptions of the formless inexistence. You see the various hues painting the sky, without any paint or painter. This is but a conception of the mind and like the vision in a dream.. It is but a different aspect of the self same Brahma.
{{< /q >}}



{{< i s="/graphics/super/natural.jpg" a="Materialist vs Natural" c="The natural view puts the physical universe inside the the abstract mind of the Supreme" >}}


This means that we are in a Matrix or the Mind of the Supreme.



Our perceptions are either of physical objects like rocks or metaphysical objects like the idea of rocks. This leads to the 2 domains which are studied by Physics and Metaphysics.

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="The Proficience And Advancement Of Learning Simplified, Book 2 Part 7" >}}
Natural science or theory is divided into physic and metaphysic.
- Physic should contemplate that which is inherent in matter, and therefore transitory.
- Metaphysic should contemplate that which is abstracted and fixed.
- Physic should handle that which supposeth in nature only a being and moving.
- Metaphysic should handle that which supposeth further in nature a reason, understanding, and platform.
{{< /q >}}



Since perception is subjective, it follows that the universe is subjective. This leads to:
- the malleability of space as teleportation
- the malleability of time as time travel
- customization of reality as alternate realities

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/bootup.jpg" a="Big Bootup" c="Instead of a Big Bang being inside a void, the universe, as part of a multiverse, is inside the aethereal mind of the Supreme Entity, as one of Its many thoughts. Spiritual people get more affinity with the Supreme and sometimes get special powers to hack physical reality (which is really very insignificant relative to the Supreme)" >}}



The materialist view of the universe belittles the metaphysical domain and treats it as insignificant, while enshrining the physical domain of physical sensations.

The natural or spiritual view of the universe, on the other hand:
- downplays physicality, calling it as an illusion or at least, something very crude and insignificant
- gives supreme emphasis on the metaphysical domain, specifically on the Supreme Entity that generates Existence

<!-- However, the natural or spiritual view without the proper goal leads to  -->

## So What's the Use of the Natural View of the Universe?

The natural view gets rid of the limitations imposed by the materialist view and expands mentality into the invisible aether. 

This leads to solutions that are impossible to materialist science as they are seen as "pseudo-science"


Science | Metaphysical Upgrade
--- | ---
Physics | Adopt the aether to allow anti-gravity, and relationality to downplay Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Medicine | Adopt the aether to allow Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, Naturopathy for more diverse cures
Politics | Adopt the aether to harmonize minds and political parties based on core idea
Biology | Adopt the aether as Lamarckism willpower as the cause for change and evolution (i.e. we can will a harmonized world)
Psychology | Adopt the aether, as Descartes animal spirits or Taoist chi, as the cause of behavior to better create behavior change
