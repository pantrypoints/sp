Existence is made up of 3 kinds of spaces | Waves, Reality, Brahma (Supreme Entity) as Existence, Existence/Identity/Perception Spaces
Superiority of the Metaphysical |
{{< /b >}}



The previous section explained the 2 domains of reality as the physical and metaphysical.

Reality is an effect of perception. 

Perception is a disturbance in a line in the aether or akasha, which is the substance for existence. This is because existence exists as a thought-projection of the Supreme Mind as the Brahman which we call the Supreme Entity.

The resulting existence is called Brahma including visible, invisible, and physical, metaphysical.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/absolute.svg" a="The Absolute" c="The metaphysical domain is much much larger than the physical domain despite having no physical size" >}}

For those who are allergic to religion and think that Brahma is a religious word, we can use the layman term **Totality of Existence**, or Existence with a capital 'e', instead. 


To know Itself, the Absolute Entity expresses ideas and feelings which then converts Itself into the Supreme Entity with an abstract space for that expression.  


## The Abstract Spaces

These abstract spaces are of 3 kinds:

1. **Existence Space**

This is the Supreme as a single collective of all identities in Existence. This is how the Supreme sees Itself.

This is called:
- Mahat in Hinduism
- Viñana in Buddhism

{{< youtube A2t6u6RHX0I >}}


2. **Identity Space**

This is each thought or identity of the Supreme within Existence. This is how the Supreme sees each Identity in isolation.

This is called:
- Manas in Buddhism
- Aham in Hinduism

{{< youtube wJ-FjkzCI3o >}}


3. **Perception Space**

This is the space that results from the perception of the identities within Existence. This is how the identities see each other, without regard for the Supreme.

This is called Citta in Buddhism and Hinduism.

## Waves and Void

The expressions of the Supreme Entity manifest as disturbances as waves in Its Own abstract Mind. 

Without these disturbances the Supreme Entity reverts to the peaceful Absolute Entity without Existence. 

These disturbances are caused by the interaction of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative, called:
- Yang and Yin in Taoism
- Shiva and Shakti in Hinduism
- Love and Strife in Empedocles' philosophy

{{< q a="Empedocles" c="On Nature" >}}
Love unites all into One. The same One is ripped through the hate of Strife. The One grows from the Many. The Many, again, springs from primeval scattering of the One.
{{< /q >}}


Again, for those who are allergic to religion, we use 'Positive' and 'Negative' instead. 

These waves create Existence.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/reality.svg" a="Waves" c="Before reality is deployed, existence is perfect without any disurbances nor any variety" >}}


### The Supreme is Everything and Everywhere

These disturbances creates pockets of void in Existence. 

These have to be filled for Existence to have no holes or 'bugs' or errors. These are filled by thinner and subtler waves. 
- physically, these are filled by particles of the the spatial and radiant layer
  - This is the foundation of free everywhere energy, now called zero point energy 
- metaphysicall, these are filled by particles of the the spatial and radiant strata
  - This is the foundation of getting inspirtation anytime and anywhere through mentality change



{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 3" >}}
A wave can move freely only when it is in harmony with previous waves and their curvatures.
It can pass through an object where there is no physical obstruction from a subtler wave, that is, subtler waves can pass through cruder waves. Under such circumstances, there is always an adjustment of wavelengths. This results in the creation of physical diversities
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Dioptrique" >}}
Almost all philosophers admit that there is no void in nature. All the bodies which we perceive around us have several pores which are necessarily filled with some very subtle and very fluid matter, which I call the 1st Element. This matter extends without interruption from the stars to us.
{{< /q >}}


The phrase "there is no void in Nature" means that God is everywhere and that God is everything. 

But since "God" is really the Anunnaki aliens, which will be explained by Bio and Social Superphysics, we say instead that the Supreme Entity is Everything and Everywhere.

For those who are allergic to religion or invisible external entities, we can say instead that the aether or 5th Element fills everything just as your screen is filled with pixels. Even a black screen turned on has black pixels active. 

This is consistent with quantum mechanics that says that empty space is not truly empty. 

- The crude waves collectively are part of the physical domain.
- The subtle waves collectively are part of the metaphysical domain.

This aether is called substance by 17th century natural philosophy and ancient Greek philosophy. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The Description of the Human Body" >}}
We see that our soul is a substance distinct from body. We know our soul solely from the fact that it thinks.
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations on First Philosophy" >}}
These external ideas and causes are made of substance. A substance is a thing capable of existing independently. For example, I think that a stone is a substance, and that I am a substance.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, Part 1" >}}
"Substance" is everything in which there is something that we perceive as immediately inhering in a subject, or through which there exists something that we perceive (i.e., some property, quality or attribute whose real idea is in us). Substance is a thing in which there exists formally that something which we perceive (i.e., that something which is objectively in one of our ideas). Mind is substance in which thought immediately inheres.

## The Superiority of the Metaphysical over the Physical, as Positive over the Negative

The subtle waves wrap around and penetrate the cruder waves in order to fill the void. In other words, metaphysical subtle waves can pass through physical crude waves. 

But physical waves cannot pass through subtle ones. This is why speed in our physical reality is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second. It is because the crude physical waves are unable to breach that subtle limitation.

This is why the subtle metaphysical domain is superior to the physical. 

Since the metaphysical is where the Positive Force dominates and since the physial is where the Negative dominates, it follows that the Positive is superior to the Negative.

This is why huge amounts of energy is not needed to breach the physical barrier. Instead, subtletly is needed. 

In some places in the aether, there arises a concentration of waves, as nodes. 
- The cruder nodes become ideas. 
- The subtler nodes become minds. 

However, our assertion of the superiority of the Positive seems to be false when see that Negative evil seems to dominate over Positive goodness as seen in:
- Capitalism consistently creating environmental destruction
- North Korea enslaving its own people
- Nuclear weapons having more importance over world peace

We answer that the victory of the Positive still wins in the very long term.

For example:
- the extinction of the dinosaurs might seem as the triumph of the Negative
  - But this is countered if we think that beautiful birds are the end result of that extinction event, which ended up as a positive
- the rapid victories of the Nazis in World War 2 might be seen as a Negative victory
  - But it ended up in the creation of the Positive EU 

Likewise, the coming war between the West and China might seem as a Negative. 
- But we assert that it will lead to a Positive harmonization of West and Eastern cultures.
