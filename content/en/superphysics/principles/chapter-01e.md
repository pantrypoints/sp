Four Wave Properties: Commonality, Density, Strength, Spread | 
{{< /b >}}




The previous section explained how Existence is formed from waves in abstract spaces. This creates the current universe that is wave-based, as proven by:
- electromagnetic waves
- gravitational waves
- gluon field in matter moving like waves
- baryonic acoustic oscillations 
- people with the same personality (mental vibration) being friends
- etc


The laws of Nature, from thermodynamics, the stages of life, and social cycles all show the wave properties of Existence which we can distill into 4:

1. Continuous Commonality

A metaphysical wave stretches is continuously like a line. This is different from a dot which is finite. 

This is why we say that the universe had no beginning and therefore no end.  


2. Frequency or Density

There are many waves in Nature. These can be bunched up creating more density and a richer Existence, or loosely spaced creating a blank Existence. 


3. Strength or Amplitude

A wave can have high amplitude as being loud and energetic, or a low amplitude as quiet and low energy. 


4. Spread or Forward movement 

A wave is a disturbance in a line that can travel fast or slow depending on its energy relative to external energies or other waves. 


These 4 properties manifest as the laws and rules in Nature which we can distill as: commonality, density, strength, and speed.

## The 4 Rules of Motion in all Sciences

Movement in physical space comes from space particles of the Air Element which Material Superphysics calls the Spatial Layer. Since space is made up of waves, as seen in gravitational waves, then the 4 properties of waves manifest as the 4 Rules of Motion as explained by Descartes and Spinoza.


### Rule 1: No Void

> No identity moves into the place of another body unless at the same time that other body moves into the place of another identity.

This is the most important rule as it also manifests in Biology.


### Rule 2: Straight or Circular 

> Every moving identity moves in a straight line when alone, and in a curve or a circle when moving with others. When in a circle, it moves away from the center.

### Rule 3: Collisions

> When a weaker identity hits a stronger, it will be deflected. When a stronger hits a weaker, it will transfer some of its force to the weaker

### Rule 4: State Continuity

Each identity remains as much as it can always in the same state. It is never changed except by external causes.



## The 4 Arithmetic Operations

1. Addition

The 1st Property of Waves is "no void". This is fulfilled by addition which adds onto the instances. This is like making a line move forward.

2. Division

The 2nd Property of Waves is frequency. A sound can be divided into smaller parts.  

3. Subtraction

The 3rd Property of Waves is amplitude. A wave can have positive and negative values as it goes up and down.

4. Multiplication

The 4th Property of Waves is forward movement. Multiplication expands just as division contracts. 

Addition and Subtraction can start from zero just as a wave can shave an origin or middle point.

Division and Multiplication need a pre-existing instance, just as a frequency needs an existing wave, and expansion needs something to expand.  




## The 4 Rules of Conversion

This implements the Law of Conservation of Aether to be discussed in Chapter 5f.

1. Mass Balance

Conversion involves material particles, not energy or space particles.

2. Force Carrier or Enzyme Specificity

Every step is mediated by a specific force carrier or enzyme.

3. Allosteric Regulation

Molecules bind to enzymes or force carriers to speed up or slow down the conversion process.

4. Exergonic Movement

Every reaction must release Radiant energy.



## The 4 Rules of Stoichiometry

This implements the Law of Conservation of Mass to be discussed in Chapter 5f.

1. Definite Proportions

A specific chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratios by mass, regardless of the compound's source or method of preparation.

<!-- Example: Table salt (NaCl) is always 39.34% sodium and 60.66% chlorine by mass. -->

2. Multiple Proportions

When 2 elements combine to form more than 1 compound, the masses of 1 element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are in a ratio of small whole numbers.

<!-- Example: The ratio of oxygen masses in CO2  compared to CO for a fixed mass of carbon is 2:1. -->


3. Reciprocal Proportions

This is when 3 different elements combine.

<!-- Avogadro's Law
Equal volumes of all gases, when measured at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules (or moles). This law provides the direct link between the volume ratios (from Law 4) and the fixed mole ratios observed in the chemical equation. -->

4. Gay-Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes)

When gases react, the ratio of the volumes of the gaseous reactants and products (measured at the same temperature and pressure) are in a ratio of small whole numbers.

<!-- Example: 1 volume of nitrogen gas reacts with 3 volumes of hydrogen gas to produce exactly 2 volumes of ammonia gas -->



## The 4 Laws of Thermodynamics 

We rearrange the law of thermodynamics to match the 4 properties of waves

### 1. Temperature (0th Law): Common Thermal Equilibrium

### 2. Conservation (1st Law): Energy changes forms

### 3. Absolute Zero (3rd Law): No radiation at absolute zero

### 4. Entropy (2nd Law): Hot radiates to Cold

This will be explained in Material Superphysics


## The 4 Stages of Life 

This is called Ashrama Dharma in Hinduism which we apply to all organic life and will be explained in Bio Superphysics.

### 1. Childhood

This is the lag phase for organisms, as seen in bacteria, as they adjust to their new environment


### 2. Adolescence

This is the rapid growth stage after the organisms after they adjust to their environment

### 3. Adulthood

Growth slows down

### 4. Old age

Organism declines as its spirit moves on


## The 4 Races

1. African
2. Aryan
3. Mongolian
4. Austric


{{< q a="Kiche People" c="Popol Vu, Part 3, Chapter 2">}}
These are the names of the first men created:
1. Balam-Quitzé
2. Balam-Acab
3. Mahucutah
4. Iqui-Balam

## The 4 Social Cycles of Socrates

This is the same as the Varnashrama system in the Vedas except that they are dynamic and not static. 

### 1. Worker (Democrat or Liberal)

The society starts, requiring hard work


### 2. Warrior (Tyrant or Military)

The society gets strong leadership and stabilizes.


### 3. Thinker (Aristocracy or Intellecuals)

The society develops its civilized culture and philosophies.

### 4. Trader (Oligarchy or Merchants)

The society gets rich through trade and soon degenerates.

These will be explained by Social Superphysics.



## The 4 Laws of Value of Supereconomics 

These are based on Book 4 of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations where he explains the sustainable flow of capital and wealth.

### 1. Everything has Value (Worker)

Violations of this law lead to the Poverty Cycle, inequality, unemployment

### 2. Value is Created to Remove Lack

Violations of this law lead to Asset price bubbles and job-skill mismatch

### 3. There must be balance in the creation and spread of value

Violations of this law lead to moral hazard and excess capacity 

### 4. Value is transferred through fair exchange

Violations of this law lead to inflation or recessions.

These will be explained by Supereconomics.




## The 4 Laws Branches of Government  

These are from the 4 cycles of Socrates which we establish as the 4 branches of government, as an upgrade to the current systems which only have 3 branches. These will be explained by Supersociology.

### 1. Legislative (Father)

This handles the creation of the laws according to the Constitution

### 2. Executive (Father)

This handles the execution of the laws

### 3. Judicial (Mother)

This is settles the interpretion of the laws. 

### 4. Resource (Mother)

This is handles the budget and allocation of resources.



## The 4 Spiritual Paths

These are the 4 ways towards the Absolute Entity via the Supreme Entity. These will be explained by Spiritual Superphysics.

### 1. Karma (Action)

This is experiencing the Supreme through action and reaction 

### 2. Raja (Discipline)

This is experiencing the Supreme through rigid discipline and austerity

### 3. Jnana (Intellect)

This is experiencing the Supreme through intellect, research, and reasoning

### 4. Bhakti (Devotion or Love)

This is experiencing the Supreme through devotion and love.



We can summarize these as follows:


**Property** | Motion | Heat | Life | Economy | Govt | Spirit | Races

**Commonality** | No Void | Temperature | Child | Nominal | Legislative | Action | African
**Density** | Spin | Conservation | Adolescent | Real | Executive |Discipline | Aryan
**Strength** | Collision | Zero | Adult | Natural | Judiciary | Intellect | Mongolian
**Spread** | Inertia | Entropy | Elderly | Market | Resources | Love | Austric
