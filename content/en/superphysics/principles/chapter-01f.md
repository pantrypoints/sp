The 4 Rules of Motion are the implementing rules of the Law of Conservation of Momentum which operates on the Spatial Layer, to be explained in Chapter 5.

These 4 Rules match the 4 properties of waves. 

<!-- Movement in physical space comes from space particles of the Air Element which Material Superphysics calls the Spatial Layer. Since space is made up of waves, as seen in gravitational waves, then the 4 properties of waves manifest as the 4 Rules of Motion as explained by Descartes and Spinoza. -->

## Rule 1: No Void

> No identity moves into the place of another body unless at the same time that other body moves into the place of another identity.

Science | Description
--- | ---
Bio Superphysics | movement of liquids in the body as explained by Galen
Material Superhysics | gravity effects from virtual space particles
Social Superphysics | Jig-society model where everyone is a piece in the jigsaw of society
Supermath | This manifests as the action of addition


<!-- This is the most important rule as it also manifests in Biology. -->

## Rule 2: Straight or Circular

> Every moving identity moves in a straight line when alone, and in a curve or a circle when moving with others. When in a circle, it moves away from the center.

This leads to spin and vortex rotation, producing fractal patterns. 

Science | Description
--- | ---
Bio Superphysics | This manifests as the helix-shape of the DNA or RNA
Material Superhysics | This manifests as particle spin, galaxy rotation, and BAOs
Social Superphysics | This manifests as political system and its leadership structure -- a circular society is more cohesive and has better leadership
Supermath | This manifests as the action of division


## Rule 3: Collisions

> When a weaker identity hits a stronger, it will be deflected. When a stronger hits a weaker, it will transfer some of its force to the weaker

This emphasizes the phenomenon of balance and natural limits. 


Science | Description
--- | ---
Bio Superphysics | This manifests as the interactions between organisms as symbiosis or predation
Material Superhysics | This manifests force, impact, and chemical reactions
Social Superphysics | This manifests as the conflicts or harmonies within a society
Supermath | This manifests as the action of subtraction



## Rule 4: State Continuity

> Each identity remains as much as it can always in the same state. It is never changed except by external causes.

This is the concept of inertia in Physics.

Science | Description
--- | ---
Bio Superphysics | This manifests as the growth pattern or sequence in organisms and the impact of the environment
Material Superhysics | This manifests force, impact, and chemical reactions
Social Superphysics | This manifests as the conflicts or harmonies within a society
Supermath | This manifests as the action of multiplication



Rules 1 and 4 are related to each other just as Rule 2 and 3 are related. 

We call:
- Rules 1 and 4 as feminine
- Rules 2 and 3 as masculine
