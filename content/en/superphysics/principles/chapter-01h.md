The first section explained how the 2 domains are static divisions of Existence, based on immediate perception as physical or metaphysical.

<!-- Section 1b explained that Existence is made up of waves that are never static. -->

Section 1c explained that reality is the part of Existence which is made up of waves that are never static.

These waves are caused by the fight between the Positive and Negative Forces.

- 0 forces do not disturb the line of cognition
- 1 force creates a disturbance as a curve
- 2 forces creates a disturbance as a wave

## Causal, Subtle, Crude within Physical and Metaphysical

The clash between of the 2 equal Forces creates a middle point each time they interact. This creates 3 parts within the interaction:

1. Positive Dominant
2. Neutral or Balanced
3. Negative Dominant 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/trio.jpg" a="Gunas" c="" >}}

It can be easily noticed how the balance part has the most number of instances compared to either dominant parts. This is why the Middle Path is advocated by Buddhism and Taoism.

This is opposed to:
- the extreme renunciation of Hinduism
- the extreme materialism of Capitalism and Communism (as Dialectical Materialism)


<!-- So how come our reality has static non-moving forms as rocks and metals?  -->

<!-- To have a basis for the actual phenomena that is sequential or made up of successive perceptions, -->

These 3 parts lead to the 3 operational divisions of reality as:

1. Causal

Here, the Positive Force dominates

2. Subtle

Here, the 2 Forces are in Balance

3. Crude

Here, the Negative Force dominates

{{< q a="Ibn Khaldun" c="Muqaddimah" >}}
The ability to think has several degrees.
1. The speculative intellect 
2. The experimental intellect
3. The first degree.. mostly consists of perceptions. 
{{< /q >}}


This is similar to the Freudian divisions of the mind as:

- Unconscious
- Subconscious
- Conscious

However, our difference is that the basis for the divisions are not awareness, but the properties of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative. 
- This is the same basis of the 2 domains. 

The interaction of different phenomena take place in 3 divisions based on their affinity with either the Positive or Negative Forces.

A static non-moving solid object get its staticity from the dominance of the Negative Force.
- This principle is the basis for freezing photons to be used for light-based computing to bypass Moore's law in transistors


### Basis for the Groupings of Phenomena

These divisions are the basis for different groups of phenomena:

Division | Phenomena 
--- | --- 
Causal | Abstract
Subtle | Living
Crude | Non-Living 

Each of these divisions have its own subdivisions made up of 5 parts.

Division | Subdivision 
--- | --- 
Causal | 5 Strata
Subtle | 5 Elements
Crude | 5 Layers 

- The 5 parts of the causal subdivision is called the 5 Strata
- The 5 parts of the subtle subdivision is called the 5 Elements, with reference to the Asian 5 Elements
- The 5 parts of the crude subdivision is called the 5 Layers

{{< i s="/graphics/super/operative.svg" a="3 Operational Divisions" c="">}}

These phenomena and subdivisions will be studied by the different branches of Superphysics.


Subdivision |  Phenomena | Superphysics Branch 
--- | --- | ---
5 Strata | Abstract | Social and Spiritual 
5 Elements | Living | Bio
5 Layers | Non-Living | Material


## Static if 3, Dynamic if 4 

The 3 divisions arises from the static view of a symmetric thing: it will have  a center and 2 extremes.
- These 2 extremes are represened by the Negative and Positive Forces.

These 3 divisions also manifest as the basis for the 3 Gunas of subelements within each Element, to be explained in the next Chapter.

The 4 divisions, as explained in the 4 properties of waves, arises from the dynamic nature of those 2 Forces, as high-low going to low-high and vice versa.
