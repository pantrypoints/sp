<!-- The Microlayers are the quantum subdivisions within the aethereal layer -->


Chapter 1 explained that reality is divided into the Physical and Metaphysical Domains. 

We defined **reality** as the metaphysical structure that forms from the waves emanated by nodes or vortices on each other. This is similar to an entity-relationship diagram.

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/er.jpg" a="ER Diagram" c="" >}}


This means that perception is the basis of reality. Since our perceptions are either physical or metaphysical, then there can be both physical and metaphysical reality.

<!-- We therefore expand the word “reality”, which comes from the Latin word “res” meaning “things”, to include both physical and metaphysical phenomena.  -->


Having only 2 kinds of reality accounts for all phenomena whether physical of metaphysical. But it does not explain the details or dynamics behind those phenomena. 

To get more accuracy with minimum complexity, we subdivide reality into 5 Elements as what was done by the ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese. 


Rank | Name | Greek | Hindu | Chinese | Vietnamese 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Aethereal | Aether | Akasha | 水 (still water) | Thủy  
2 | Spatial | Air | Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Mộc 
3 | Radiant | Fire | Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Hỏa  
4 | Convertible | Water | Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Thổ
5 | Material | Earth | Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Kim


This is like subdividing a meter-reality-ruler  into centimeters so that the finer details of reality can be accounted for. 

These Elements are further subdivided into Subelements to get an even more detailed view. 
- This is like subdividing centimeters into millimeters. 

For example, the Fire Element (Electromagnetism) is divided into:
- the light subelement to explain colors
- the heat subelement to explain heat
- the virtual photon subelement to explain magnetism


Currently, Modern Physics knows only 3 of these 5 Elements as the Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic Forces. 

Superphysics | Physics 
--- | ---  
Aethereal | Pseudo-science  
Spatial | Gravitation 
Radiant | Electromagnetic Force  
Convertible | Weak Force
Material | Strong Force


This is because physicists impose a limitation on themselves to ignore or avoid metaphysical perceptions like ideas, feelings, and spirits. This in turn is because their minds favor the material and crude perceptions as being universal or common to all. 


## Layers with a Hierarchy

Nowadays, people associate the word "elements" with the chemical elements in the periodic table. 

This is why we will use the word "layer" instead of elements for the 5 factors or components of Nature. 

An analogy is a Photoshop image which is made up layers that are on top of each other that creates a full picture.

{{< img src="/graphics/super/layers.jpg" alt="Layers in an image" cap="Reality is made up of 5 Layers which the ancients called the 5 Elements" >}}

The layers in Photoshop have a hierarchy where one layer is on top of, or covers the ones below it. 

Similarly, the 5 layers of Existence have a hierarchy wherein the highest aethereal layer covers all. This makes matter the most inferior layer.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/domains.svg" a="The 5 Layers of Superphysics" >}}


For example, Modern Physics tells us that:
- gravity can affect light, but light cannot affect gravity 
- electromagnetism can affect iron, but ordinary iron does not exert electromagnetism
- a mass of iron can exert a small amount of gravity, but not enough to affect light 

This exposes a natural hierarchy, wherein:
- gravity is superior to light (electromagnetism)
- electromagnetism is superior to matter (strong force)
- dark energy as the atomic space (which we call the aetherspace) is superior to gravity


<!-- These layers are the effect of the fight between the Positive and Negative Forces to be discussed in Chapter 3. We can say that reality is an arena for the fight between them.
- The journey from Pure Positivity to Pure Negativity is called *crudification*, which creation is part of
- The journey from Pure Negativity to Pure Postivity is called *subtilification*, which discovery is part of

Both creation and discovery are part of existence or reality -- you create something then discover or learn its uses, then create something new and so on.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/operative.svg" a="The 5 Layers of Superphysics" c="The 5 Layers, 5 Elements, 5 Strata are similar but different. The 5 Layers are for Physical Phenomena. The 5 Elements are for Living Phenomena. The 5 Strata are for Mental and Spiritual Phenomena. The Mental-Spiritual is Superior to the Physical" >}}

## The 3 Gunas or Influences

The ancient Greeks did not have a concept of hierarchy built into their 5 Elements. Instead, they used the center or mean.

{{< q a="Timaeus" c="Timaeus by Plato, Chapter 3" >}}
If a set of any 3 numbers has a mean, the mean is to the 1st number just as it is to the last number.. If the universal frame was just a surface with no depth, a single mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other terms.
{{< /q >}}


We use the concept of **Influences** or Gunas to divide each Element or Layer into 3 so that there will be a middle, center, or mean for each Element or Layer. This is seen in our Medium-Substance-Quantum model which replaces the Standard Model.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/msq.svg" a="The MSQ" >}}

<!-- This is why we rename the "Elements" into "Layers" in order to impart:
- the hierarchy within the 5 Layers
- the subdivision of each Layer into 3 Sublayers -->

For example, the reality of a rock is made up of layers of properties are perceived together in the identity of the rock:

1. The aethereal idea of the rock 
2. The volumetric space occupied by the rock
3. The color of the rock as the light bounces off of it
4. The intermolecular forces that hold the rock together
5. The contact forces that prevent the rock from going through the ground 


We put these Layers into a hierarchy 

1. Aether Layer
2. Air Layer (Space) 
3. Fire Layer (Color) 
4. Water Layer (Chemical Forces)
5. Earth Layer (Contact Forces) 

We then expand these into 15 Layers to account for the Spiritual-Social, Biological, and Material aspects of Nature.


Rank | Spiritual and Social | Biological | Material | Assigned Number
--- |  --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Causal | Aether | Aethereal | 5
2 | Essential | Air | Spatial | 4
3 | Astral | Fire | Radiant | 3
4 | Subtle | Water | Convertible | 2
5 | Crude | Earth | Material | 1


The assigned numbers are what the Greeks gave to the Elements or Layers. This is why we call the Causal or Aetheral as the 5th Element or Layer.  

These 15 match the 15 Rupas or Material Forms in Buddhism

Superphysics Name | Buddhist Name
--- | ---
Material Layer | Pathavi
Comvertible Layer | Apo
Radiant Layer | Tejo 
Spatial Layer | Vayo
Aethereal Layer | Cakkhu
Earth Element |  Kāya viññatti 
Water Element | Jivhā
Fire Element | Jīvitindriya
Air Element | Ghāna
Aethereal Layer | Sota
Crude Layer | Kaya
Subtle Layer | Vaci Viññatti 
Astral Layer | Oja
Essential Layer | Hadaya
Causal Layer | Akasa


<!-- ## The 5 Layers are an Atheist or Pantheist Belief 

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" >}}
It is a thousand times more credible, that 4 mutable elements, and 1 immutable fifth essence, duly and eternally placed, need no God, than that an army of infinite small portions, or seeds unplaced, should have produced this order and beauty, without a divine marshal
{{< /q >}}

The 5 Layers are Atheist in the sense that all layers and particles are 'programmed' and do not need an overseer. 

Socrates promoted the Elements paradigm of Timaeus and was executed because of his atheism.  -->

<!-- However, they are Theist in the sense that a program needs a programmer.  -->
<!-- 
This is opposite of the Theist Universe of Isaac Newton:

{{< q a="Newton" >}}
"This most beautiful system [of the universe] can only come from an intelligent and powerful Being.. This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the universe, but as Lord overall. I call Him Lord God or Universal Ruler"
{{< /q >}}
