{{< i s="/photos/physics/space.jpg" a="Space" >}}

The Air Element facilitates the functioning of space and time in reality. Its job is to separate perceptions, identities, objects, ideas, and feelings from each other. 

This is why it is the Element for the Forces such as gravity, magnetism, and material cohesion. 

This is why, in love relationships, space as proximity is very important and why long distance relationships are not usually strong, just as magnetism is strong but has a short range, and gravity is weak but has a longer range.  

Without space and time, all perceptions would be in one experience and be very messy. 

Spacetime is also the key to understanding the aether which is above it.

This is why only long-running civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, have a chance at unlocking the aether.

A small part of the Air Element is metaphysical. This is why Modern Physics is unable to discover the cause of gravity and is why there is currently still no true anti-gravity technologies. 


Subscience | Name | Use of the Spatial Layer
--- | --- | ---
Material Superhysics | Spatial Layer | The start of physicality by providing the physical arena for the ideas as light, matter, objects, etc.  
Bio Superphysics | Air Element | This facilitates the chi or animal spirits and chakras (as organic spatial vortices) that lead to different emotions
Spiritual Superphysics | Spatial Stratum | This facilitates spiritual feelings
 <!-- dynamics of the Heart Chakra -->


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 4, Article 202" >}}
I deny the existence of gravity inside any body. Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.

## The Air Layer Causes Forces and Wear and Tear

The job of Space particles is to separate identities. This makes them cause the weathering and the wear and tear of physical things, including mountains, cars, electronics, and human bodies. 

For example, friction is from the space particles giving movement to 2 objects that grind away at each other.
