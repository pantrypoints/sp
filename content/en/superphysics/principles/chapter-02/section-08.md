The 5 Elements of Reality is always useful since it describes how Reality works or is maintained.   

It can be immedately used as a proper goal-setting framework that aligns with the Nature of things. At the moment, the most popular framework is SMART:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable or Achievable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/ngu.jpg" alt="The 5 Elements model" >}}


If we put SMART Under our Five Elements Model, we see that it overly emphasizes the Earth Element (matter-based) through the 4 criteria of being specific, measurable, achievable, and realistic. 

This is consistent with SMART being invented by George T. Doran, a Western academic. It is in line with Western materialist systems and philosophy which prefers hard evidence over abstract concepts.

Only the 'Time-bound' criterion is 'immaterial' by being in the Air Element relating to space and time. 

The problem is that success is really achieved by alignment with the Aethereal Element as the cause, of which the Earth Element is just an effect.  

Giving too much emphasis on specifics, measurements, and attainability neuters the mind too much and disconnects it from the infinite possibilities granted by the higher elements. 


Although SMART improves goal-setting by adding the 2 Elements of Earth and Air, as opposed to not having any system at all, it also sabotages success by ignoring the other 3 Elements. This will give less success than if all the 5 Elements were used.

## The 5-Element Criterion for Goal-Setting

Our goal setting based on the 5 Elements will solve the deficiencies of the SMART criteria. 


Name | Description
--- | ---
Natural | is the goal in line with dharma or the Nature of Things? This replaces the Realistic criterion
Time-bound | the goal should be encapsulated as an endeavor or project (This is from project management)
Comparable | the progress towards the goal should be comparable to a control or benchmark. This replaces the Measurable criterion
Flexible | the goal should have a Plan A, Plan B, etc as many roads can lead to that goal. This also means that the goal itself can be shifted or tweaked a bit. This replaces the Achievable criterion
Definable | the goalposts and results should be defined as to be comparable | This is similar to the Specific criterion

### Natural Criterion

The first criteria is the natural-ness of the goal. There are some goals imposed by others that are not natural. 

For example, Chinese and Vietnamese parents impose that women must marry before 30. But not all women have marriage as their natural goal or would want to marry later than 30.

Some managers impose unnatural sales or profit targets that are not natural in a time of recession.

Under this criterion, a genocide or the use of nuclear weapons is not a goal because it is something that humans do not naturally do. 

This Natural Criteria helps people choose the goals that are not only realistic, but also in line with morality and Nature. 


### Time-Bound Criterion

This is already discussed extensively in Project Management literature. 


### Comparable Criterion

People measure things for the sake of comparison. This is why we focus on the criterion of comparability instead of measurability.

For example, you might want to have a general goal of a good 2024 for your son, using only his happiness as the basis. With this criterion, you can compare his happiness in 2024 with 2023 without any quantitative measure.


### Flexible Criterion

In most cases, there are sudden events that impact our goals greatly. An example is the pandemic which made many businesses fail. 

The Flexible Criterion is based on the flexible Water Element and so it knows that goals must be flexible. This is also in line with the Natural criterion. 

If one way doesn't work, then try another way while staying with the general aim. Under SMART, other other hand, the goal must be very specific. If the result does not match the specifics, then the goal fails.

For example, many Vietnamese have a goal of owning a house after reaching a certain age. This criterion removes the rigidity by allowing, as options to home ownership:
- long-term lease or
- different kinds of houses such as container house

Another example is a woman having a goal to find prince charming which she defines specifically under SMART as:

1. Rich
2. Handsome
3. Tall
4. Caring
5. Loyal

But under our 5 Element Model, this might manifest as 5 different persons. And so, looking for these in 1 person might be impossible!


### Definable Criterion

The goal has to be defined to make the abstract goal more realistic.

In the example of the goal of house ownership, how would you define a house? 

Does it have a specific minimum floor area? Does it have to be in a specific city? Should there be internet or mobile data coverage?

Note that the Flexibility Criterion is Superior to this one, just as the Natural Criterion is superior to the Flexible. The definition is not as specific or rigid as the one under SMART. 


## More Realized Goals, More Happiness

The more we realize our goals at work, or in life in general, the more we gain a sense of fulfillment and therefore, happiness. 

If setting goals using the SMART Criteria was not so effective, people can try the Ngũ Hành model, which has already been used in Asia for various applications, as an alternative way to achieve their goals. 



<!-- SMART also does not allow tweaking of the goal itself to match the changing reality. Instead, goals are discarded and new ones are created.  SMART is built for a static universe. DSCFD is built for a dynamic, ever-changing one. 

DSCFD uses general defintions instead of specifics. For example, true love can be a goal if you can generally define what true love is, and this generality is in line with flexibility. 

DSCFD is an example of using the knowledge of the 5 Elements of Reality to achieve success within that Reality.

After completing the bucket list of things to achieve in Existence, then the person doesn't have to go back to Reality after death (i.e. a soul no longer has any leftover desires or unfinished business, and so can literally and really Rest In Peace RIP).

In this sense, life itself is one big project with a start and end to achieve the purpose or dharma of each living entity. If you fail your purpose, then you go simply back and reincarnate into the Matrix of Existence until you succeed.
