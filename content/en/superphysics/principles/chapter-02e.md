This is responsible for the diversity and change in the universe whether mental, biological, or material. 

In Physics, this manifests as chemistry, chemical change, and chemical reactions. 

Historically, the Chinese invented gunpowder by using the principles of change of the Water Element. 

In Material Superphysics, this is called the Convertible Layer which is responsible for:
- 'flavor changing' or changing the nature of particles
- intermolecular and intramolecular forces

For example, neutrinos are part of the Convertible Layer and are detected in **liquids** such as argon. 

In Bio Superphysics, the Water Element is the blood, lymph, and sperm which create the diversity in the realm of human biology.

In Spiritual Superphysics, this is the creative aspect based on the Sex Chakra.  


Subscience | Name | Use of the Convertible Layer
--- | --- | ---
Material Superhysics | Convertible | This is the start of the Weak Force in Physics
Bio Superphysics | Water | This shows the evolution or change in cells and organisms, including reproduction
Spiritual Superphysics | Subtle | This facilitates creativity
