## How Things are Generated

The Supreme Entity begins the existence of something by having an idea of it. 

The desire for it then pushes it down the 5 Elements onto the physical domain, as a physicalized version through the Negative Force.

This physicalized version is then experienced by consciousness through the Positive Force. 

This closes the loop between mind and reality, as experiencer and experience. This then justifies Existence.

{{< img src="/graphics/meta/flow.png" cap="The loop from ideas to experience" >}}

<!-- Thus:
- The Negative Force separates and creates ignorance
- The Positive Force unites and creates knowledge -->


{{< q a="Lao Tzu" c="Part 6, The Tao Te Ching Simplified" >}} 
The Great passes on in constant flow. Passing on, it becomes remote.  Having become remote, it returns.
{{< /q >}} 


The physicalized versions of metaphysical ideas are the physical expression of those ideas. 

<!-- Since ideas and feelings exist before their physical counterparts, we can say that the latter are expressions of such ideas.  --> 

For example, a tasty dish is an expression or manifestation of the idea of tastiness. 
- The cook had a metaphysical idea for a tasty dish and so he created a tasty dish in reality.
- This tastiness is proven after he tastes it and is experiened by his mind.
- This **closes the loop** from his mind creating an idea of a tasty dish to his mind actually experiencing a tasty dish.
- The match of idea and experience then forms his truth: "Yum! It really, truthfully was a tasty dish."

In the same way, the universe exists because the Creator had an idea to create it. 

Our experiences of the universe is part of the loop-closings that verify or give truth to Creator's ideas. 

This loop began with the creation of the universe and is closed with our experiences of it. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/cycle.svg" a="Venn Diagram" c="The loop from metaphysical idea to physical experience then back to metaphysical realization" >}}


For example, the Supreme Entity might have an idea of a car. 

So It creates a vortex that gathers into a galaxy.
- This galaxy then produces stars and planets.
- The planets have minerals and living organisms.
- Those organisms then evolve to become intelligent, capable of invention
- They then invent a car and see its benefits, validating it as a good idea.
- This validation then feeds back into the Supreme Entity, closing the loop
- This prompts the Supreme, as the oversoul of the Inventors, to sustain that car and further develop it

<!-- , then humans, then inventors, then  manufacturers to finally have a physical car to be validated by a conscious being such as a human to close the loop.  -->

<!-- Everything that we perceive in the universe therefore is an expression of the latent ideas of the Creator that It makes from Itself. 

The Creator had an idea of tastiness among Its infinite ideas. So It created the universe, via a 'Big Bang' to create stars that created matter that led to life that led to humans who could cook a delicious dish which was completed when it was actually tasted by someone who validated the idea by saying "Yum!". 
 -->

{{< i s="/photos/objects/car.jpg" a="Supercar" >}}

The timespan from the creation of the galaxy to the actual invention of the car might take billions of years from our perspective.

But since the ideas and mind of the Supreme is rooted in the Aether and not the Air Element (space and time) then It is not bound by that time.

To It, the closing of the loop from the idea of the car to the experience of the car is instantaneous.  



## Desire and Alignment are the keys

The existence or reality of something requires desire which is a kind of feeling which itself is a wave.

<!-- In our novel analogy, the novel came to life when the reader's mind started browsing the pages. The act of reading comes from the desire to read.  -->

In Physics, this desire-wave manifests as radiant energy (Fire Element), either as heat, light, magnetism, electricity, etc.  

Brute radiant force, full of Negativity, is one way to acheive an outcome or desired reality. For example, an anti terror operation might use a huge cluster bomb to kill a terrorist leader in a crowded village. 

{{< i s="/photos/physics/nuke.jpg" c="" a="Nuke" >}}

Another way is through subtle radiant force through intelligent or sophisticated electronics. For example, a spotter with a laser pointer communicating with a sniper can kill the same terrorist through coordination via electronics. 



<!-- {{< img src="/graphics/psych/horse.jpg" cap="Nature, as the physical aspect of the Supreme, keeps on putting desire objects for the ego to chase" alt="horse" >}} -->

In business and entrepreneurship, this desire is called *grit*. Successful businessman are known to have more grit than non-successful ones. Grit in business can be expressed:
- in a brute way via aggressive salesmanship, or
- in a subtle persistent way through networking and neticulous planning and forecasting


<!-- Investors invest in entrepreneurs that have the most grit. Superphysics can help the businessman, or any human that has a goal, to experience his goal by explaining the metaphysics of grit and desire.  -->

<!-- Back in our novel analogy, the reader might have a strong desire to read. But he can only read what the Novelist has written down.  -->

Having crude or subtle desire does not guarantee success or realization. 

- In the terrorist example, the mission will not succeed if there is no one to give information about the terrorist. 
- In the business example, the business will not succeed if the product or proposal is totally faulty or terrible


Therefore, merely having strong desires in not enough to create a good reality. This is the common cause of the failure of those who use the Law of Attraction to manifest their desires.  

**What's more important is to align those desires to the desires of the Supreme Entity.** 

The Hindus call this alignment as *Dharma*. 

This dharma comes from match of the current idea of the person with the original idea of the Supreme. 

In our car invention example, the invention of the car was successful because it was aligned to the original idea of the Supreme. 

If the inventors had instead invented a motorcycle, then they would find less success in it. This would then prompt them to evolve it into a car. 

However, the invention of the car would not be realizable if there were some dogma that blocked the science of car mechanics from being taught. 

In this case, the dogma or taboo against car science is a desire in the opposite direction. 

This opposition leads to clash with the natural desire to invent a car, leading to staticity (instead of a freeze).

How to deal with Opposition will be explained in Chapter .

<!-- The Law of Conservation of Idea explained in Chapter 3 and is notated as `G` in Chapter 4c. 

This alignment is done by the reader by choosing the right cat-novel to read. The proper alignment does not come instantly but happens through instances of trial and error. The more instances, the better. We call this as *learning experiences*.  

The quality of learning experiences would be higher if the scope of learning were expanded. A reader can find a better cat-novel if he searched at a bigger library or bookstore. Superphysics expands the library of science by adding to it the library of metapyhsics. -->

<!-- Nowadays, the advancement science has led to economic growth, but has also opened up new problems:

- Global warming
  - Disasters like floods, mass extinction
  - Seasons being hotter or cooler than normal
- Covid (The reduced cost of air travel allowed Covid to spread quickly)
- Poverty and Inequality 
- Political instability 
  - Terrorism (since 9/11, terrorists have used airplane technology)
  - Migrant crises

There is clearly a desire to solve them. But no solution has been found because the learning experiences have been confined away from metaphysics.  

## Let's Solve Problems Inside the Matrix

Superphysics uses the blending of science (particles) and metaphysics (waves) to find the solutions and implement them faster than ordinary science or philosophy. This will help create a *dharmic* reality that is in line with the Metaphysics of Things inside the Matrix of Existence. 

Since prevention is better than cure, then AI will be the key to discover the patterns of feelings to make sure we stick to the dharma and avoid giving problems to ourselves.

The concept of a metaphysical domain allows us to explain the properties of metaphysical ideas. This then leads to our Law of Conservation of Idea, which is the base for the Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy.
