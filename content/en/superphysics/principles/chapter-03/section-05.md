The fundamental importance of dharma in the existence or outcome of a wave or endeavour leads to the concept of dharmagenesis.

This is the basis of:
- the initial spin in quantum mechanics
- the butterfly effect
- the charateristics of a star or galaxy in classical mechanics
- the founding laws or constitution or traditions of a society
- the genetic configuration of offspring
- the success of a project


The knowledge of the factors affecting dharmagenesis, as the pervading waves, ideas, or physical environment with other objects and forces, will lead to a proper start to things.

This has been documented most famously as the butterfly effect where a chaotic system has a sensitive dependence of initial conditions.

- In biology, this will prevent birth defects or bad results from breeding.
- In business, this will prevent bad startup or entrepreneurial ideas from wasting money and effort.
  - We proved this during the pandemic which caused many businesses to close down. Our model predicted a global stagflation by 2020 from war or global warming disasters, and so we advocated a policy of consolidation instead of expansion 
- In chemistry, this will prevent waste of trial and error in making new compounds
- In politics and sociology, this will prevent conflict by understanding the ethos of each race or social group

<!--  This is especially true for our youth because that is the time when:
- the character is being formed, and
- the desired impression is more readily taken. -->


Basically, it means that before you start something, you should know:
- the true intention or motivation behind it. This is the miro part
- whether that intention matches the flow of reality or environment. This is the macro part

In our case, the universal pains and protests from the Financial Crisis of 2008 led us to realize that humans want a flow towards real solutions. This matched our inherent micro-flow towards finding solutions. 

We found that there is a conflict between the current temporary physical flow of the human body and the eternal metaphysical flow of souls that inhabit the human body. 

This led us to think of the dharmagenesis of the humans species, which turned out to be slaves for the Anunnaki to mine gold and precious metals and minerals, similar to how rare earths are needed for high tech products.
