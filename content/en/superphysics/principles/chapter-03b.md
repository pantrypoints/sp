<!-- Consciousness is merely the perception of existence. To test it, you have to test existence. But existence is just an effect of the perception of the perceiver. So the only way to test consciousness is for the tester to test himself. The study is problematic because its postulates to test consciousness is based on consciousness itself. For example, the first postulate requires the system to have 'information'. But a thing will only be 'information' if consciousness decides it to be so. Its second postulate sets a phi as a measure of integrated information which, in essence, is a measure assigned arbitrarily by the researcher's consciousness. If the subjective consciousness of the researcher were removed, then a hard drive would technically be conscious, since it has information and can integrate and manipulate it. In reality, a hard drive or a robot is not 'conscious' because it does not match our own idea of consciousness or our way of self-perceiving. -->


The previous section explained the nature of the Absolute Entity, as Pre-Existence, as a theoretical concept to come before Existence.

We say that the Absolute left the nothingness of Pre-Existence by becoming or transforming into the Supreme Entity, generating Existence in the process.

Why Would the Absolute leave its Pre-Existence State and go into Existence?


## The Reason For Existence: Value or Importance

As an Absolute Entity It is the same as Nothing and has no value or importance.  

In order to gain value or importance, the Absolute needs to observe Itself. It can only do this by splitting Itself up into parts. 

It starts this by having the **desire** for Itself and Existence. 

It is this transformation caused by this desire that generated all the possible ideas from Itself as the aether. 

Spinoza calls this aether as “substance”:

{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics, Part 1, Proposition 11" >}}
God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists.
{{< /q >}}


Parmenides calls the Abolute as the One, and the Supreme as Existence:

<!-- Since the One exists, then t -->
{{< q a="Parmenides" >}}
The Whole [Brahma] has the One [Nirguna] and Existence [Saguna] as Its parts. Each of these parts have both the One and Existence as its parts and is at the least made up of 2 parts. The same principle goes on forever. This makes the One infinitely many.
{{< /q >}}
<!-- Every part always has these two parts because existence always involves one, and one involves being, so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two. -->

The creation of Existence necessarily creates the Consciousness to perceive those ideas. This is why Existence and Consciousness are really 2 sides of the same coin.

In the static form:
- Existence is the fabric
- Consciousness is the hole that Existence goes into

{{< youtube lISLgasNjHk >}}


In the active form:
- The universe, filled with idea objects, makes up Existence which has a liquid or flowing nature
- Reality is the tube that is opened up in the subtle parts of Existence 
- The unit mind flows through that reality-tube to 'consume' the ideas in Existence and process them into more complex ideas
- Ego is the center of the unit mind, as one of the ideas in the universe

So we call existence as:
- Existence-Consciousness in the static view
- Reality-Mind for the active view

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/exist.jpg" a="Existence" >}}

<!-- By using the particle physics of Descartes and Spinoza, we can make an analogy:
- pre-existence is a mind is  
- mind is a wavy, liquid substance that flows through that hole in that liquid
- existence is made up of things that go through the hole   -->


This Existence-Consciousness and Reality-Mind does not have a start or end because it is aethereal or idea-based. 
- The Spatial (Air) Element does not exist yet. 
- Instead of 'when' and 'where', its properties are just 'is'. 


And so we say that Existence-Consciousness always was, is, and will be* and therefore, there was never any actual transformation event from Absolute to Supreme. Instead, we use transformation of potentiality into actuality that is applicable to unit minds within Existence. 

{{< f f="There are some theoretical physicists who imagine that the universe will get destroyed through a thermal death or through false vacuum decay into a true vacuum. We assert that such things are impossible based on our principles of the 5 Layers and 2 Forces." >}}

We usually take consciousness and mind for granted because our consciousness and mind is so common to us.
- And so we say 'existence' without mentioning the 'consciousness' that is always needed to verify that existence. 
- Or we say 'reality' without mentioning the 'mind' that creates that reality. 

And so we normally are unable to realize the association and the dynamics of that association, which we call 'relationality',



## Difference of "God" and "Nature" 

The Supreme Entity encompasses the abstract concept of God and Nature.

- The abstract "God" refers to the Higher Mind of the Supreme
- Abstract "Nature", as the system of forces or laws that sustain Existence, refers to the Lower Mind of the Supreme

It is the lower mind of the Supreme that facilitates observable natural phenomena that we attribute to Nature.

It is the higher mind of the Supreme that facilitates the unobserved phenomena like how the souls of dead people reincarnate, how karma floats as samskara or pending reaction, how solution-ideas exist in potentiality waiting to be grasped by the physical (lower) mind. 

We say that the lower mind is a bit obvious and the higher mind is mysterious.

This hard-to-observe property of the higher mind is why people even ask "Does God exist?"
- It proves that the Higher Mind is difficult to perceive

This is also why people often respond: "I don't know, but I believe in a Higher Power".
- This is because the power of Nature is far more obvious and so people use that obvious perception to infer the existence of something Higher that is not so obvious or describable.   


<!-- The physical universe is therefore the most obvious means of Its expression just as we are less obvious and more complicated ones.  
The question 'Does God exist?' can be answered by 'Can you perceive Existence?'. 
 -->

This will be explained in Chapter 8b.

## Concepts Emerging from Existence-Consciousness 

The concept of Existence-Consciousness leads to the following concepts:

1. The 2 Forces
2. Particle Shapes as nuts and bolts
3. Relationality


<!-- In our Big Bootup analogy in Chapter 2, this means that reality was always “turned on”, since:
- Existence is the “on” state
- Pre-Existence is the “off” state

Whenever we say “existence”, we automatically infer a consciousness behind the scenes to perceive that existence.  -->


<!-- Similarly, space and time were seen as separate because our location is more obvious and common to us than time (i.e we usually wear watches to remind us of the time instead of carrying maps or GPS devices to remind us where we are). 

This was until experiments showed that space and time were one entity. -->
