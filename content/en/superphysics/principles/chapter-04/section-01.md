## Planck Length as the Gap Between Perceptions

Chapter 1 explained that identities, ideas, and minds are nodes formed from concentrations of both subtle and crude waves which come from the Aether Element.

These are created by the Negative Force as it cuts up the Supreme Entity into parts. 

But at the same time, the Positive stitches those parts together. 

These makes the nodes separated by perception gaps which we call timespan.
- This is from the Negative Force which is imparted by the Air Element or Spatial Layer which facilitates space and time.
- The Positive Force glues these nodes together to create a single consistent experience.

This operation is similar to your screen being made up of pixels that are separated by a distance called a *pixel pitch*.
- The smallness of the gaps makes them imperceptible

{{< q a="Timaeus" c="Timaeus by Plato Simplified, Chapter 4" >}}
The Creator rejoiced when He saw his creation moving and living..The nature of the creation's Idea-being was everlasting. But it is impossible to make creation everlasting. So He resolved to have a moving image of eternity. When He set the order of the heaven, He made this image eternal but moving according to number, while eternity itself rests in unity. This image is what we call time.

In Modern Physics, this gap is called the Planck length which is a very small distance: 1.616255 × 10−35 meters 


## Spacetime Slices

We plug these gaps into our wave model of nodes, vortices, and ideas to create the concept of spacetime slices. 

<!-- Chapter 2 explained that the role of the Air Element is to separate objects. This is why all physical and biological forces are sourced from it.  -->

Each spacetime slice is a collection or group of waves that have a common quality either in frequency, strength, speed,  or thickness (subtle versus crude). 

Their affinity with the observing mind, which is also a node but more subtle, makes them perceivable. 

These are then stitched together by the Positive Force that influences that mind to create the structure of reality for that mind.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/nodes.svg" a="Slices" >}}


In other words, each of our perceptions is in am aethereal cognition-slice called spacetime. These slices are glued together by the flow of our aethereal minds, creating our fluid reality. 

**This means that only the present perception is the basis or anchor for all our other perceptions.** 

{{< i s="/graphics/flipbook.gif" a="Flipbook about a cat" c="Reality is made of independent slices like an animation" >}}



This was best explained by Rene Descartes:


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 1, Article 21" >}}
The parts of timespan are not mutually dependent and are never co-existent. We exist now. But it does not follow that we will exist in the next moment unless the cause of our existence keeps on sustaining us. We know that:
- we have no inherent power to keep our existence persisting in every moment
- another being has so much power to keep our existence out of himself

This means that that being, as God, preserves himself.

And by David Hume:

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 1, Section 3" >}}
If you wheel around a burning coal rapidly, it will appear as an image of a circle of fire. There will seem no gap of time between its revolutions because our perceptions cannot succeed each other as fast as its rotation. Wherever we have no successive perceptions, we have no notion of time, even though there is a real succession in the objects.
{{< /q >}}


The common fallacy is to believe that our perceptions happen within space and time. In reality, it is the other way around.

Space and time are merely effects of our successive perceptions which in turn caused by the fact that waves are continuous and recurring.

### The Slices are the Basis for Dimensions

Past, present, and future are therefore the arrangement of the spacetime slices according to the aethereal flow of cognition. 

- Space is regarded as the 3rd dimension, which is really 2 dimensions stitched together by the same flow of cognition. 
- Time is regarded as the 4th dimension when the 3rd dimension is stitched together according to the changes in itself. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/aetherspaceall.jpg" a="Dimensions" c="The 6th dimension is a universe as the collective of the 5th dimension as alternate realities" >}}


From this we can say that:

- The 5th dimension is the 4th dimension stitched with probabilities, as alternate realities
- The 6th dimension is the 5th dimension stitched with different laws, as different universes
- The 7th dimension is the 6th dimension stitched with a total perspective, as the total reality
- The 8th dimension is the 7th dimension as one object, as perfection or void

By doubling the sides of the first Tetractys, another Pythagorean Tetractys is constructed, of the number 36, the most famous and in all respects the most useful which they possessed, that is the triangle of numbers of which the
base is the Eightfold.

## The Upgrade of the Dimensions from the Upgrade of the Human Mind

The universe that we see is just a limited 4th dimension version of our 6th dimension universe.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/density.jpg" a="Density" c="The expansion of the universe mirrors the expansion of human cognition" >}}

When human cognition was at a caveman level, the universe was static, with the Earth at the center of a 3-dimensional universe. 

This was revised into a heliocentric universe when cognition expanded beyond the Earth. 

This was further expanded when humans decided to build large telescopes leading to the cognition of the 4th dimension as time.
- This led to galaxy clusters, as a cosmic web.  

This was expanded further with quantum mechanics with light showing wave-particle duality which proved a 5th dimension as alternate realities superimposed on each other.

The 6th dimension is a combination of the 5th dimension being compared to each other. This can be achieved when humans reach other star systems through teleportation. 


We summarize the 8 dimensions below:

Dimension | Name | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
1 | Existential | Identity
2 | Planar | 2-dimensional space
3 | Spatial | 3-dimensional space
4 | Temporal | Time
5 | Lateral | Alternate Realities
6 | Multiversal | Universes in the Multiverse
7 | Causal | Ultimate Cause
8 | Void | Void
