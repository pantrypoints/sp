There are 2 Domains in Reality | The Cartesian View has both Planes

Previously, we divided reality into 2 domains:

1. The Metaphysical
2. The Physical


Then we introduces the 3 operational division of the 2 domains:

1. Causal
2. Subtle 
3. Crude


The current sciences ignore the metaphysical domain, as well as the causal and subtle parts of reality. Instead, they focus solely on the crude physical domain. 

To explain metaphysical phenomena, humans have invented philosophy, religion, and mysticism. These have been disregarded by science as imaginary. 

Science brands their explanations as pseudo-science, as if science and the physical domain (where matter resides) were superior to the metaphysical (where spirit and the aether reside).


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Part 2, Article 9" >}}
People who distinguish substance from size or number actually do not know what incorporeal substance means. They think that substance is physical. They thus think that a corporeal substance has a [metaphysical] size [when it really is a monad or point-particle]. And so they express something quite different from what they comprehend in their mind.
{{< /q >}}


We cure this materialistic view by creating the a metaphysics-first perspective which we call the Cartesian View which has 2 parts:

1. The Aethereal Cartesian Plane for the Identity Space

2. The Material Cartesian Plane for the Perception Space


This view takes:
- the metaphysical domain as the cause (via the Aethereal Cartesian Plane)
- the physical domain as effect (via the Cartesian Plane)

Currently, science has only the 'Cartesian plane' which is used to plot movements on paper.

It is a 2-dimensional space that has quality in one axis relative to time in another axis. The movement through time makes the 2D space infinitely long.

Here, the `y` axis represents a quality in different magnitudes of variations. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/cartesian.png" alt="Cartesian planes" cap="The Cartesian Plane (left) plots the changes of an identity through time or relative to time (temporal changes) based on certain quality. The Aethereal Cartesian Plane (right), on the other hand, plots the changes of qualities relative to each other. The latter shows the how different each self is the previous and future self. " >}}

We add the **Aethereal Cartesian Plane** which is has the identity as its origin and has multiple axes representing the qualities of that identity that change over time.

The Aethereal Cartesian Plane reveals more data which can be interpreted as new information which we call the dynamics of the identity. These dynamics are then based on its gravitational signature or dharma. 


## There is Only Euclidean Geometry

Modern Physics thinks that Euclid's book, The Elements, is about shapes on a 2D surface. 

In reality, it is about the dynamics of the 5 Elements (which we call the 5 Layers), and is why Euclid named it as such.

When used with the Cartesian View, Euclid's geometry can describe 3-dimensional surfaces and patterns. 

The main difference with Physics is that Euclid's Geometry does not focus on the paths that an object would take. 

This is because sequential paths only happen in the 3 Elements (Electromagnetism or 1st, Weak or 4th, and Strong or 3rd Elements). The aether (5th Element) and the aetherspace (2nd Element) are non linear and non sequential. 

Instead, it focuses on the start and end of that path. This is useful for teleportation where paths are unnecessary.

Teleportation and other aether-based technologies require knowledge and dynamics of the gravitational signature. This signature is visualized or revealed by the Aethereal Cartesian Plane like how a Fourier Transform makes a wave easier to understand.  

<!-- The movement of a country can be physical or aethereal. The left physical Cartesian plane for example can be made to represent the movement of a country from a population of 1 million to 4 million at year 4. The right aethereal Cartesian plane plots movement of the soul of the same society from tyranny or neoconservatism (tetrahedron) into aristocracy or conservatism (octahedron) based on the Socrates' social cycles. Alternately, the left plane can represent Covid infections from 1,000 to 4,000 at the Day 4. The right plane can plot the evolution of the variants that emerge. Lastly, the left plane can represent a ball at [1,1] rolling to [4,4]. The right plane will then plot the changes in the ball's changing gravitational signature at each point [1,1] [2,2] [3,3] [4,4], as three time intervals. This will then be useful for levitating the ball (forceless movement) -->
