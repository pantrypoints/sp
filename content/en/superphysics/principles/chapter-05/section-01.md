## Eternal Existence

The 5 Elements model showed that space and time, as the Air Element, are beneath the Aether Element which we defined as the substance of ideas, feelings, and the abstract mind that has those ideas and feelings. 

This is why:
- space and time are relative
- the metaphysical components that make up physical things are eternal in nature

This means that the universe is eternal and had no beginning.

The idea of the universe having a beginning only arises when people neglect the existence of the aether or the substance of their own ideas i.e. they don't know how they get their ideas or feelings. 


Yet still, we need to explain what is the origin of the aether that makes up the core of Existence.

<!-- The Sequence of Creation in Chapter 2 explained that our universe is a result of the Creator having an aethereal idea of a universe that eventually materialized by going down the 5 Layers. 

But how does the Creator create ideas from nothing?

And how did It push those ideas down to turn them into physical reality? -->


## Pre-Existence and the Absolute Entity

The only way to think what came before actual Existence is to create the idea of potential Existence, which we call Pre-Existence. 


{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Heavens, Book 3" >}}
It is possible for one body to be generated out of another. Air for instance is generated out of fire. But in the absence of any pre-existing mass, generation is impossible. That which is potentially a body may become such in actuality. But if the potential body was not already in actuality then some other kind of body, as a void, must exist.
{{< /q >}}


Before Existence began, the Supreme Entity had nothing, not even the medium of the aether, to create ideas with. 

We call this state Pre-Existence and refer to the Supreme Entity in this state as the Absolute Entity to imply Its Nothingness.

Since it is beyond Existence then both **Pre-Existence and the Absolute Entity do not exist and are merely theoretical**. 

Since these do not exist we can say that Existence is in a potential state.

- In Hinduism, this is called Nirguna Brahma
- In Buddhism, this is called Sunyata or Emptiness
- In Greek philosophy, this is called the One by Parmenides

{{< q a="Buddha" c="Heart Sutra" >}}
Form is emptiness, emptiness is surely form. Emptiness is not different from form, form is not different from emptiness. Whatever form there is, that is emptiness; whatever emptiness there is, that is form. The same for feelings, perceptions, volitional processes and consciousness.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Parmenides" >}}
If there is one thing, then it cannot be many and cannot have parts. If it cannot have parts, then it cannot be a whole.. and will have neither beginning, middle, nor end, for these would be parts of it. Thus, the One has no beginning nor end. It is unlimited and therefore formless.
{{< /q >}}


We create such a theoretical state in order to prevent minds from thinking of what came before the universe was created. Doing so will open up paradoxes and infinities that will waste mental energy.

Therefore, our concept of Pre-Existence serves as an instant “sink” that will positively absorb and nullify that thinking effort (as opposed to a wall which blocks the thinking tendency and is therefore negative).

{{< i s="/graphics/super/exist.jpg" a="Existence" c="The Absolute can be viewed as the holder for Existence, or the central point of Existence, with Existence being the Supreme Entity" >}}


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 1, Article 26" >}}
We will thus never enter disputes about the infinite. This is because we are finite. It would be absurd for us to try to determine the infinite.
{{< /q >}}




## What Came Before Pre-Existence?

The concept of pre-existence absorbs all ideas. 

So if a person asks 'what came before pre-existence?', then there is no need to create another concept called 'Pre-pre-Existence' just to stabilize that curiosity. 

This is because it is really the **desire** to know that is causing such a curiosity. 

So it would be better to deal with the asker's desire -- why does he want to know what existed before Existence? 

It could be a sign that:
- he has too much time on his hands
- he has no control of his thoughts or desires, or 
- his Luna mount on his palm is too strong, etc. 

The usefulness of the idea of Pre-Existence is therefore to **prevent the waste of real time and mental effort** in thinking about what goes on beyond or before Existence.
- This waste afflicts Theoretical Physics the most.



## Concepts Emerging from Existence and Pre-Existence

The concept of Existence and Pre-Existence leads to the following concepts:

1. Existence-Consciousness
2. 2 Forces
3. Cycle of Creation
4. Operational Divisions of Reality
5. The 5 Elements of Reality
