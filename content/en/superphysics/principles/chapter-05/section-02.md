There are 2 Domains in Reality | Ideas are Static, Feelings are Dynamic
{{< /dc >}}


Chapter 1 explained that the Absolute Entity creates Existence by destabilizing Itself through the Negative Force which is countered by the Positive to create a loop. 

This converts its undisturbed nature into a disturbed one, converting a single huge straight monotonous colorless line into many independent waves full of color and diversity.

## Nodes of Waves are Ideas

The places where many waves meet leads to nodes that we can compare to bubbles which are then encountered by other nodes which absorb, refract, or reflect them, just like how light waves are absorbed, refracted, or reflected. 


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="The Evolution of Languages" >}}
Between 2 points there is a flow of cognition. In that flow, bubbles are created. These bubbles are ideas in the Cosmic emanation of the Supreme. When these bubbles touch the unit "I" feeling, ideas are created in the unit. These are the reflections or refractions of the Cosmic Idea. The unit tries to express them through its own psychophysical structure as speech and language.. As far as the reflected bubbles are concerned, the language of the universe is the same forever, always one and indivisible.

An expressive node (EN) that absorbs a non-expressive node (NN) then processes it according to its own node-configuration (EN config) and then emanates waves that are similar to it, as its expression (EN version of NN). 

That wave-expression (EN version of NN) is then absorbed by other expressive nodes (EN2) and re-expressed according to their configuration.

This creates variations of the original non-expressive node (NN1, NN2, NN3) increasing the diversity in Existence. 

Since nodes are ideas, this is best seen in "pass the message" games where a idea imparted by a message gets changed each time it passes from a person.

{{< i s="/photos/social/pass.jpg" a="Pass the Message" >}}


From here, we can see that the root of gossips and falsehoods are caused by the tendency of each person to adjust the idea to match his own mental configuration or mentality or beliefs. 

This adjustment can be:
- positive, as in the case of art where the idea of a heroic deed is converted into an idea of a monument for that hero
- negative, as in the case of a jealous wife equating the idea of her husband coming home late with the idea of cheating 


{{< i s="/photos/psych/wife.jpg" alt="Wife" >}}


The ideas themselves are static. But they are manipulated by the feelings of the expressive nodes or living things or people that get them.

It follows that the diversity and changes in Existence are caused by feelings. 

This is consistent with our assertion in Chapter 3c which pegged the cause of Existence to desire which is a kind of feeling. 

It follows that:
- feelings are dynamic waves
- ideas are static particles
- feelings are the cause of ideas

{{< q a="George Berkeley" c="Commonplace Book" >}}
All ideas are passive.
{{< /q >}}


This is consistent with our interpretation of reality as spatial slices glued together by our subtle mental waves of cognition, which we call time particles in Material Superphysics. 

<!-- Unlike Physics which emphasizes matter and energy, our system emphasizes waves and feelings.  -->

## Identity Versus Entity

We define "identity" as a discrete resultant perception separate from other perceptions or a mass of perceptions.

This discreteness comes from the separation created by the Negative Force on the parts of the Supreme Entity. 

"Entity" is anything that has identity and other properties.

In contrast, the word "identity" emphasizes only the property of separation or discreteness. 

So love and hate are identities as love-idea and hate-idea. But they are not entities unless love and hate have other properties like size, structure, energy, etc. 


### Identity-Relationship Versus Entity-Relationship

An identity-relationship is the relation between identities. An example is the relation of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4..

An entity-relationship is the relation between entities (that have other qualities). Examples are the relation between:
- father and son
- table and chair
- flag and country


## Feelings Versus Ideas 

This is opposite of most of Western philosophy which puts emphasis on ideas over feelings. This is why the West emphasizes criticial thinking, but has no concept of critical feeling.

We could only find Descates, Spinoza, David Hume, and Adam Smith really pushing for feelings. For example:
- Descartes pointed out the cause of human feelings to the aerial animal spirits which are equivalent to chi in Taoism and vayu in Hinduism
- Spinoza listed and described the different human emotions
- David Hume wrote that morality is based on feelings, not reason
- Adam Smith wrote the Theory of Moral Sentiments, based on Hume's principles 


In contrast:
- Plato and Socrates focused on ideas, tested through dialectics
- Kant disregarded feelings in favor of reason
- Schopenahauer emphasized ideas over feelings 


The dominance of the Western world as a result of colonialism led to the spread of intellect or brain over the feelings or heart. 

This matches the reality of the current prevalence of:
- the World Wars and the Cold War and its proxy wars 
- environmental destruction
- the gap between rich and poor as proven by the words Global North and South, First world and Third world
  - This is really based on the mercantile system which evolved into Capitalism which enshrined the merchant class



## Concepts Emerging from the Difference of Ideas and Feelings

The differences in the nature of idea and feeling, as nodes versus waves, leads to the following concepts:

1. The connection of ideas as simple thoughts and compound beliefs
2. The geometry of ideas
3. Mental configuration as personality
4. The Conservation of Idea
5. Samskara that batters the mind into a personality
6. Truth checking as dharma


<!-- These ideas and feelings are all made up of the positive and negative aspects. This is similar to:

- data being made up of 1's and 0's
- electricity arising from positive and negative charges
 -->
<!-- 
The Hindus call this Virtual Reality or Existence as **Brahma** and the Taoists call Its flow as the **Tao**. 
- The ‘on’ or 'published' state is called **Saguna Brahma** 
- The ‘off’ or 'draft' state is called **Nirguna Brahma** -->
