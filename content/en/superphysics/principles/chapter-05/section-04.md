Chapter 5b explained how ideas are nodes created by the intersection of various waves which are thought-projections of the Supreme Entity. 

Richer nodes have waves coming from different directions. 

When bunched up together, this mass of waves ceates a regular pattern that we call a shape. 

For example, 3 waves intersect creates a spatial hexagon or a linear triangle.

## Vortices: Positive and Negative Direction

At its most basic configuration, only 2 waves go against each other as a Positive Wave and a Negative Wave. 

- If the Positive Wave is more powerful, then it will be on top of the hierarchy and the flow will be anticlockwise. We call this a Positive Direction.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/clockanti.jpg" a="Anti Clockwise Rotation" >}}

This Positive Direction was noted by the ancient Vedics as the swastika symbol.
- Su (सु) means "good"
- Asti (अस्ति) means "being"
- ka (-क) is a suffix that forms a noun.

- If the Negative Wave is more powerful, then it will be on top and the flow will be clockwise. We call this a Negative Direction.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/clock.jpg" a="Clockwise Rotation" >}}


However, the word 'counter' in counter-clockwise seems opposite of the word 'positive'. We would expect instead that clockwise would be positive and counter-clockwise would be negative.

To better associate the Positive with Anticlockwise, we create a clock that is in line with Nature, by putting the starting point at the bottom instead of at the top.

We often read left to right, just as many people are right-handed. So from the bottom, we start counting naturally to the right. We call this natural movement as the Positive Movement in the Positive Direction. 

The "observation starting point" will therefore be from the bottom or farthest from the "existential starting point" which is the top. 

Its opposite is to read from the right to the left. We call this the Negative Movement in the Negative Direction. 

Unlike the Western clock that starts from the top, in a position of ego, our clock starts from the bottom, in a position of humility or nothingness. This is in line with the natural concept of Zero. 
 


## Vortex Center and Vortex Dynamics

Chapter 2g explained that the middle part of the a wave or vortex creates a third force as the balancing force.
- This is also the most numerous of the 3 forces and therefore strongest of them

In vortices, this middle part manifests as the center, called singularity by Physics for black holes. This is emphasized by the swastika above.


Taoism on the other hand emphasizes the 2 Forces called:
- Dark Yin (with a tiny Yang spot) for the Negative
- White Yang (with a tiny Yin spot) for the Positive  

Some Taoist schools say that it does not matter whether the Yin-Yang symbol is shown in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. We say that it *does* matter. The symbol should always be in a **counterclockwise or Positive direction**. 

{{< i s="/icons/tao.png" a="Yin Yang" >}}

This is proven by most of the planets in our solar system rotating in counterclockwise direction. Venus was once habitable when it rotated counterclockwise. We hypothesize that it became hell when it flipped into a clockwise direction.

Moreover, the Positive white Yang should always be on top as implied by the Tao-te-Ching. This is because aethereal ideas have a shape which implies a proper orientation (right-side up). 

An idea can be learned, or a problem can be solved, faster by approaching the idea or problem **at the right angle that matches its orientation.** This is similar to a spaceshuttle re-entering earth at a proper angle to avoid burning up. 

This angle and shape are consequences of the Negative force which surrounds each idea or identity in order to separate it from other identities.

Without the knowledge of this shape, the only alternative is to approach a big problem from all possible angles, leading to a waste of time and effort as trial and error.


## Machine Learning and the Platonic Shapes 

Some problems are so complex that the proper angle is hard to achieve with the hit-or-miss approach. 

This is why Superphysics will be able to solve problems, even the complex ones, faster than Science which has no concept of the geometry of ideas which is really caused by the relationality of ideas (to be explained in Chapter 6).


<!-- , as shown in the ba-gua -->

Plato alludes to this through the 5 Platonic shapes. 

{{< q a="Timaeus" >}}
“The first 3 regular solids are formed from the right triangle:
1. The tetrahedron
2. The octahedron
3. The icosahedron
4. The cube, from isosceles
5. The dodecahedron, from 12 pentagons”
{{< /q >}}


Superphysics visualizes these through the Aethereal Cartesian plane which will be done by machine learning, since it's too complicated for a human.

As we are still researching this relationality-shapes, this will be explained in the future.

For example, we use:
- Supereconomic ratios to expose the relationality between different prices which will then expose the inefficiencies in economic systems
- Social Cycles ratios to expose the relational harmony or conflict between countries

We plan to apply this to chemical and electron reactions in Physics in order to create new technologies in the future.  

<!-- We actually use this technique to come up with solutions to economic crises and social crises faster than Economists or Sociologists. 

The problem is in implementing those solutions in the physical real world because of the static 'aether-drag' in human minds. -->
