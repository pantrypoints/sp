The previous section explained how spin in space is the mechanism for relational action.  

Does it mean that 100% of the spin comes from the spinning identity?


## Spin Energy Comes From Outside, Configuration comes from Within

Spin is just the physicalized version of wave frequency or density in space. 

The waveness of a wave does not come from one small part of section of the wave. Instead, it comes from the whole wave, as the 1st property of waves, explained in Chapter 1d.

The major difference between waves is their:
- frequency as Property 2
- amplitude as Property 3
- speed as Property 4 

Similarly, the energy of a spinning identity does not come from the identity itself, but from the relational action of the aether and other identities. This is because there is no Void in Nature (1st Property of Waves).

It follows that **it is the configuration of the identities that make them different from each other**. These differences are:
- spin speed as Property 2
- spin strength as Property 3
- spin forward speed as Property 4 

Therefore, relational action action mostly comes from the identity's configuration. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/exist.jpg" a="Spin" c="The configuration of an identity determines what can flow through it" >}}


This is because the outside forces actually power the spin, but that power can only flow through it if it is configured to receive that flow.


## Spin is Effort

We call the persitence of this configuration, as well as the changes to it, as "Effort".

An example is a claw machine that has so many toys under it. The claw can grab (receive) a toy if it can match the shape of the toy (match its spatial nature) as to be able to lift it to the hole.  


{{< i s="/photos/objects/claw.jpg" a="Claw machine" c="The claw needs to match the toy" >}}

The effort of the machine therefore is to:
1. Actually execute the action by deploying the claw (Property 4)
2. Making the claw match the toy (Property 2)
3. Keep the toy held until it reaches the hole (Property 3)


Unfortunately, the claw is limited to a certain range of movements (stifled Property 4 and 2). This makes it incapable of matching the spatial nature of most toys. 


## So What's The Use of Spin?

Spin is very important in Material Superphysics in manipulating the Fire, Air, and Earth Elements, called Electromagnetism, Weak, and Strong Forces in Physics. 

It is most essential in tapping free energy from space called zero point energy. The free energy is like prizes floating freely in space, with humans not having the special claw needed to harness them due to the backward, materialist nature of Physics.  

Bio Superphysics uses it for proper growth and health.

Social Superphysics uses it to match people with each other, as student-course, business-customer, jobseeker-employer, husband-wife, candidate-politicalparty, etc.

This is most useful in finding romantic partners since male and female are already predisposed to be attracted to each other. All that is needed is to find the matching spins that would create lasting or specific-use partnerships.   

Spiritual Superphysics uses it to recommend the proper philosophy or religion to each person depending on their mental spin or mentality. 
- Weak minded people would likely go for easy religions like Christianity, or dogmatic ones like Islam
- Strong minded people would likely go for the lightning fast Vajrayana or Hindu Tantra
- Devotional people might go for Sikhism
- Intellectuals might prefer Buddhism with its many abstractions



<!-- Our Theory of Dynamism: State and State-Change

Unlike Physics which makes its equations and principles from the motion of bodies, Superphysics bases its principles on the changes in the perceived identities. 

Motion, or change in location, is just one of such changes. Another change is from small to large, like a seed turning into a plant, or a change from poverty to prosperity, as in a society.

Our principles are therefore derived from the perceived changes in state. From here it follows that:
- the universe is inherently dynamic
- there is an inherent potential dynamism in each object
- an object’s dynamism can be tapped by letting it interact with the proper objects other than itself
- the dynamism of objects depend on their relations with each other 

This is the foundation of our Theory of Dynamism. 

This theory aims to know the causes and effects of all change and movement, whether physical or metaphysical. 

This is to harness such movement and dynamism in order to reach our goals, such as to solve problems that are unsolved by Physics and Science. -->
