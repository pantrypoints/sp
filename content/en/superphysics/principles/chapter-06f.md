The Law of Conservation of Idea showed that Existence is a single Entity. 

A change in one part of the entity creates a change in another part. 

This leads to a relation between parts. We call this relationality. 

There are 5 fixed Elements in Nature and so there are fixed relations in every universe. 

Physics calls these fixed relations between and within the 5 Elements as physical "constants".

Constant | Relationality
--- | ---
Newton’s G | Aetherspace : Spacetime
Speed of Light | Light : Space
Planck’s Constant | Light : Aetherspace
Coulomb Charge | Electron : Virtual Photon
Boltzmann’s Constant | Heat : Aetherspace
Vacuum Permittivity | Space : Electron
Vacuum Permeability | Space : Virtual Photon
Fine-Structure Constant | Electron : Aetherspace


## Einstein

For example, Einstein's `E = mc^2` has `c` which represents the constant speed of light as a ratio between space and light: 1 unit of light substance is 300,000 kilometer-units of space substance. 

This makes `c` the conversion factor converting radiance to space as porential force. 

Superphysics interprets it as "The potential radiant volume of radioactive matter is equal to its destabilized aetherspace volume activated by radiance as to occupy space." 


## Newton

Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation `F = (Gm1 Gn2) / r` uses the constant `G` which is the ratio of aetherspace particles to space particles. 

This translates to: "The volume of space particles between 2 masses is obtained by converting 2 aetherspace-mass-volumes into space particles spread over the distance between them"


## Maxwell

Maxwell's `c = 1 / √ u0 e0` is full of constants, saying: the consumption of space by light is equal to what is unconsumed by the root of the volume of virtual photons and electrons in a volume of space.


## Planck

Planck's equation `E = hf` is the Effort (spin speed) per timespan of light being based on the qualitatve aetherspace being converted into time i.e. effort is the qualitative aetherspace.
