## The Positive Force Creates Life By Adding Subtlety

Nodes made up of crude waves become crude ideas which eventually become physical things because of the Negative Force. 

As a physical thing becomes more complex through heat, weathering, compression, mixtures, etc, it naturally becomes larger and develops gaps.
- These gaps need to be filled by the subtler waves until they form a subtle node in a larger crude node.

This becomes a simple mind in a physical organism as a living thing. 


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 2" >}}
Mind arises as a chemical reaction of physical clash within the unit structure. This is because its physical body itself is a creation of the Cosmic Mindstuff. This Cosmic Mindstuff keeps the subtler Identity and the Ego as its dormant aspects. The first stages of the creation of mind is thus from natural physical chemical reactions where vital energy is present. These first minds are made up of mere mindstuff, without ego. But without ego, the blind vital energy cannot cause the physical structure to act. Most of the minds of undeveloped creatures and plants are made of mindstuff. Further psychic evolution leads to the expression of ego that creates identity. The active-identity leads to the intellect. The pure identity leads to supra-physicality.

Therefore:
- a physical thing is a large node made up of crude waves
- a living mind is a large node that has subtle waves persisting in it 


So the key to life are:
- the volume of subtle waves that can persist in the crude node and be part of it
- the crude nodes allowing such residence of subtle waves in them
  - Such crude node are called organic matter.


### A Positive Unifying Environment is Necessary for Life, a Negative Crude Environment Kills Life

Therefore, an environment with a lot of Positive Force, as positive energy, is essential for life. 

Consequently, the introduction of a lot of Negative Force, as negative energy, kills life.

This is easily seen in:
- rainforests that have a lot of life
- polluted industrial zones leading to health risks and deaths in the native species
- crime-infested cities having a lot of death and suicide

## Testing for Life or Non-Life

Perception occurs when these living node-minds interact with:
- forces or waves as non-nodes
- other living node-minds and
- other non-living nodes as things

We know that a crude node gets perceptions when it reacts.
 <!-- as proven by its subsequent reactions to stimuli. -->
- For example, a rock reacts to light by reflecting it so that it can be seen.


But since the crude node has no flexible subtle waves, it is very limited in its expressive ability. 
- The rock can only express the light it encounters by bouncing it off as a specific color.

A living node, as a physical organism, on the other hand, can express more since it has subtler and more flexible waves.  
- For example, a bacteria can react to light by moving away from it, aside from reflecting it.



## Cells as Ideas

Chapter 1f explained that nodes of waves are called ideas. 

Chapter 5c explained that simple ideas can be conneted to form compound ideas. 

We extend this to biology where cells are either:
- simple (unicellular) or
  - Here, the DNA is usually circular
- compound (multicellular).
  - Here, the DNA is usually linear


## DNA strands

DNA is a long, complex molecule with a double helix shape which resembles a twisted ladder. 

<!-- The steps of the ladder are the -->

<!-- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It contains the genetic instructions used for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known life.

DNA is a long, complex molecule with a distinctive structure known as a double helix, which resembles a twisted ladder. -->

<!-- Structure of DNA

The DNA molecule is a polymer composed of repeating units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three parts:

    A Phosphate group (forms the backbone). A Deoxyribose sugar (forms the backbone).
    One of four Nitrogenous bases.

The "ladder" structure is formed as follows:

    The Sugar and Phosphate groups alternate to form the two vertical sidepieces (the backbone) of the ladder.
    The Nitrogenous Bases pair up across the center to form the rungs of the ladder, held together by hydrogen bonds.-->

The steps of the double helix ladder are made up of a sequence of 4 Nitrogenous Bases as the letters ATGC.

Letter | Name | Type | Pairing Rule
--- | --- | --- | ---
A | Adenine | Purine (Double-ring) | Always pairs with Thymine (T)
T | Thymine | Pyrimidine (Single-ring) | Always pairs with Adenine (A)
G | Guanine | Purine (Double-ring) | Always pairs with Cytosine (C)
C | Cytosine | Pyrimidine (Single-ring) | Always pairs with Guanine (G)

These match the 4 properties of waves:
- Commonality goes with Spread just as Thymine goes with Adenine
- Density goes with Strength just as Cytosine goes with Guanine

The DNA caries the wave-programming of each cell as a part of the overall programming for the whole body. 


## The DNA as an effect of the Crown Chakra (Vortex)

In Cartesian science, the programming of the entire body is sourced from the crown chakra which manifests as the pineal gland .

This chakra rotates, creating the twisted double helix shape of the DNA. The twist is easily seen in quasar jets that also have a double helix shape.
