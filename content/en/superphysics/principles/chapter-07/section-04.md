## Elementals or Nature Spirits, Aliens, Spirits, Ghosts 

Not all minds have to be attached so dependently to the physical domain. 

There are some minds that exist above the physical domain. These can crudify themselves to manifest in physicality just as we can go deep inside caves or dive underwater to experience different kinds of natural environments. 

We call these minds as Elementals or Nature Spirits. In Sanskrit, these are deva 

The fact that they are described consitently by so many cultures who don't talk to each other proves that they are a real phenomenon instead of just being imaginary isolated cases.

What is lacking is the explanation of their mechanics or natures. 

A common historical mistake is to associate them with aliens such as the Anunnaki who were well-written by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and Mayans. 

We have defined:
- "soul" as a metaphysical mind without its crude parts.
- "spirit" as a metaphysical mind in active form with waves of forces and feelings flowing through it

Souls and spirits are immortal since they are in the metaphysical domain above the spatial element. However, they can transition, evolve, and reincarnate just like all souls whether human or non human do.  


An alien is a physical entity that did not evolve naturally on Earth. These can be more advanced or less advanced than humans.
- The more advanced ones are called "devas" in Asian cosmology.

A ghost is a spirit that has become visible in the physical domain without a physical body.

A nature spirit therefore is a spirit that is associated with specific waveform or vibration. They are usually associated with spatial waves as spatial vortices. These are called devayoniis.

They walk through solid walls, through rocks and stones, like a spirit.

Elementals are associated with specific locations such as a mountain, a forest, a hill, etc. This is because such places have vortices which connect to the natural reality of those elementals. 

Unlike the Supreme Entity or Brahma, these devas and devayoniis are not worshipped. Instead, they are befriended for energy exchange. This manifests as people giving food, money or fruits to idols or statues that represent those Elementals. 

The Elementals then get the energy, not from the offerings, but from the **mental state or flow** of the person doing the offering. This is because the 'worship' state adjusts the configuration or spin of the person, allowing energy to flow to the Elemental.

As these are living organisms, we classify them into the 5 Elements of Bio Superphysics.

Name | Example
--- | ---
Aether | Siddha 
Air | Garuda
Fire | Yaksa, Kinnara
Water | Naga, Cernunnos (winter spirit)
Earth | Virus


Elementals that are noted consistently across civilizations are:

Name | Description
--- | --- 
Cernunnos | Elk type winter spirit
Santa Claus |
Naga | Serpent that warns of earthquakes and other disasters
etc | 

{{< i s="/photos/bio/naga.jpg" a="Naga" c="The Naga is a common elemental in various countries" >}}


<!-- We classify elementals according to the 5 strata of Spiritual Superphysics, combined with 2 of the 5 layers of Material Supeprhysics.

Name | Example
--- | ---
Material | Virus 
Radiant | Naga
Crude | Yaksa
Subtle | Kinnara
Supramental | Ghandarva
Essential | Garuda  
Causal | Siddha -->


## Viruses are the Material Version of Elementals and Spread Life to the Universe

Biology does not regard viruses as alive because they fail the criteria of cellular structure, metabolizing ATP, and independent reproduction.

However, Bio Superhysics regards them as alive as they are capable of independent expression. 

Moreover, their gravitational signature is obvious in their RNA or DNA.

They are not only alive, but they also spread life to other planets through comets, as panspermia. 


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Microvita in a Nutshell, Chapter 1" >}}
These microvita are the carriers of life in different stars, planets and satellites – not carbon atoms or carbon molecules
{{< /q >}}


{{< i s="/photos/physics/comet.jpg" a="Comet" c="Comets spread life through elementals as viruses" >}}


Unlike normal animals or plants that can express directly onto space, viruses need to infest a living organism to transmit that expression to that organism.

This is the same mechanism used by elementals for their expressions to be perceived in physical reality. 

A person who detects elementals raises his gravitational signature to be close to the frequency of those elementals.

This means that people who can detect elementals are subtle and not crude.




## Alternative to Excessive Capitalism


This requirement of subtlety by elementals is the main reason why we are pushing for the science of elementals which is included in Bio Superphysics. 

The interaction with Elementals is like a symbiosis between animals or a barter deal between economic actors. It is not a master-slave or god-worshipper relationship that is used in religions. 

We give them energy, and they are expected to fulfill our requests. 

This is why, aside from pushing a moneyless economic system we are also pushing for the revival of native practices on Elemental as an alternative to Capitalist materialism. 

In this way, people have more subtle ways to get their needs met aside from being enslaved by material money and numberical bank accounts.  


<!-- Buddhist devas are not immortal.[14] Their lives as devas began some time in the past when they died and were reborn. They live for very long but finite periods of time, ranging from thousands to (at least) billions of years.[9]
Buddhist devas do not create or shape the world.[15] They come into existence based upon their past karmas and they are as much subject to the natural laws of cause and effect as any other being in the universe. They also have no role in the periodic dissolutions of worlds.
Buddhist devas are not incarnations of a few archetypal deities or manifestations of a god; nor are they merely symbols. They are considered to be, like humans, distinct individuals with their own personalities and paths in life.[16]
Buddhist devas are not omniscient nor omnipotent. Their powers tend to be limited to their own worlds, and they rarely intervene in human affairs. When they do, it is generally by way of quiet advice rather than by physical intervention.
Buddhist devas are not morally perfect. The devas of the worlds of the Rūpadhātu do lack human passions and desires, but some of them are capable of ignorance, arrogance and pride. The devas of the lower worlds of the Kāmadhātu experience the same kind of passions that humans do, including (in the lowest of these worlds) lust, jealousy, and anger. It is, indeed, their imperfections in the mental and moral realms that allegedly cause them to be reborn in these worlds.
Buddhist devas are not to be considered as equal to a Buddhist refuge. While some individuals among the devas may be beings of great moral authority and prestige and thus deserving of a high degree of respect and veneration (in some cases, even being enlightened practitioners of the Dharma), no deva can ultimately be taken as the way of escape from saṃsāra or control one's rebirth. The highest honors are reserved to the Three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha -->


## Bacteria


Simple Elementals that have crossed over to full physical expression manifest as bacteria or single-celled organisms
