Chapter 7 explained that the range of expression makes the difference between living and non-living things.
- living things are more expressive
- non-living things are less expressive

Their ability for perception and expression are determined by the quality and quantity of subtle waves that make up their nodes or minds. 

Both simple bacteria and plants do not have the ability to express self-motion. 
- Simple bacteria express motion through adhesion
- Plants express independent motion through growth
