The most advanced animal species is the human race called Homo Sapiens by Carl Linnaeu in 1758:
- homo means man
- sapien means wise

## The Anunnaki Hypothesis 

Humans are the only known advanced species on Earth able to create civilizations. 


## The 10 Vayus or Animal Spirits

Decartes' animal spirits match the vayus and chi in Hinduism and Taoism. 

These facilitate forces internally and externally of the body.

--- | ---
Heart | Blood Circulation and Nerves
Chest | inhalation and exhalation
Throat | voice
Navel | coordinates Base and Chest
Base | controls urine and stool


External | Purpose

Contraction | Contractive Muscular activity

Hunger | Thirst and Hunger
Sleep | Sleep and drowsiness


## Why We Get Sick

Sickness is a state of the body that deviates from the blueprint of the oversoul of the human species.

Each species has an oversoul as a complex mind made up of nodes of ideas. This oversoul supplies the template for instances of its species called individuals. 





## Death


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 1" >}}
**The loss in the parallelism of physical and mental waves causes death.**The physical cause of death is the passing away of the 9 vayus (10 minus sleep vayu) into eternal space. The psychic waves, finding no proper adjustment with the physical waves, also dissociate and pass into eternal space.
