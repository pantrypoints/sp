The previous section explained "paranormal" life forms such as:
- elementals, including viruses, that need to infest organisms to express themselves
- aliens, as organisms that did not evolve from Earth 
- spirits, as metaphysical minds

The infinite and eternal nature of the universe, along with the principles of life and the Positive Force, show logically that life can exist in so many places in the galaxy and in the universe.

In the physical domain, "intelligent" life is more rare than non-intelligent life because physicality is where the Negative Force dominates. 

As beings evolve into the metaphysical domain which is the domain of the Positive, the volume of intelligence increases until omniscience is achieved at the level of the Supreme Entity. 



The following are the consistent accounts from various ancient sources, and by consistent modern information as in the case of the Grays.

Physical Aliens | Source

Anunnaki | Creators of humans, from Cygnus 
Grays | Genetically modified future humans, from Zeta Reticuli
