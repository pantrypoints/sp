Everything already pre-exists in Existence as the Supreme Entity.

Therefore, everything is already known and all problems are already solved from the viewpoint of the Supreme as the perfected agent of the Absolute Entity.
- We call this the state of omniscience.

However, this perfected state is also worthless. 

This is why:
- the Negative Force keeps on disturbing the perfection
- the Positive Force keeps on realizing the value of that perfection

The Imperfect state is called Existence, as the Supreme Mind, which is made up of disturbances as waves and nodes. 

How the Supreme Mind realize Its own Value?

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Enquiry, Section 1" >}}
The operations of the mind are most intimately present to us. Yet, whenever we reflect on them, they seem obscure. Therefore,  science should:
- know the different operations of the mind
- separate them from each other
- class them under their proper heads
- correct all their disorder when they are inquired into

## The 3 Actions of the Mind

This Mind has 3 actions due to the 2 Forces. This matches the 3 Gunas or Influences:

1. Flow (association, expansion)

This is the most natural action showing the "All-ness" of Existence. The flow includes logic or how the waves of the mind naturally jumps from one idea or node to another, even without thinking.

Thinking makes the jumping more forceful, which is really just adding to the flow

2. Force (attraction / repulsion)

Quantification or digitization or digitalization are effects of the repulsion to the continuous analog flow.

Quantification creates instances that are notated as numbers.

This arises from counting discrete identities as instances.

This makes each instance or number a unique identity itself, each with its own quality that is revealed when they are processed with other identities.

3. Memory or storage

This takes the form of notation.

We call these 3 the operations of the mind.

## The Flow and Force of Thinking Versus Knowing

The integration of these node-ideas leads more and more to the state of Omniscience where all nodes are united as One.

We are ignorant of a thing that we cannot associate with anything.

For example, when someone asks you what a "gnomon" is, you cannot answer. 

The gnomon-idea object enters your mind. But since you have nothing to connect it to, you reply in null.

Someone will tell you that the gnomon is the pointer of a sundial that casts a shadow. 

Your mind gets new idea-objects as "pointer", "sundial", "cast a shadow". 

If your mind does not know what a sundial is then it still cannot associate it to anything coherent. 

But if you know, from memory, what it is then your mind will associate "gnomon" with "pointer of sundial". 

{{< i s="/photos/objects/clock.jpg" a="Sundial" >}}


- The thinking proces was your mind trying to find associations for gnomon. 
- The learning process was your mind storing "gnomon" = "pointer of sundial" into memory.
- The memorization process is to store the spelling or sound of "gnomon" as is

These actions show the actios of flow, force, and memory to lead to knowledge.

Knowledge in turn validates the manifested idea. This completes the loop from the Supreme having an idea for a gnomon which pre-existed and actually became realized and validated upon the invention and use of an actual gnomon. The fact that it has a name means that it has value enough to be assigned a unique name. 

This is similar to the idea of Covid being validated by getting a name Covid-19, and further validated in the invention of vaccines against Covid-19.

## Thinking, Instinct, Thought, Cognition, Intuition, Learning, Memory, Cognition

Therefore, **thinking** is the process of integrating external idea-nodes within the Lower mind (node) to the actual pre-existing idea in the Higher Mind.
- This uses 2 actions, as Flow and Force with emphasis on Force, is the job of the upper part of the Lower Mind

**Instinct** is mechanical thinking action of the lower part of the lower mind to maintain a connection with the body.
- This is as an automatic flow, with force, similar to mechanics. 
- Instead of integrating external idea-nodes, it integrates external sensations and compares them to the pre-existing programming of the Lower Mind which really comes from the Oversoul of the human species, or whatever species the organism is part of. 
- The common programming of humans (versus dogs for example) can be regarded as current the "gnome" or reasoned-belief of the human Oversoul. This explains evolution and makes it part of Bio Superphysics.

**Knowing** is the actual of integration of these idea-nodes.
- This uses Flow, and is courtesy of the Higher Mind

<!-- **Thoughts** are the products of the thinking process as it grabs and processes ideas. -->

**Knowledge** is the product of the integration of these idea-nodes.

**Thought** is the packaging an idea-node as it goes through that thinking process. 
- This is like putting a kilo of rice in a flimsy plastic bag into a rigid wooden box to standardize it with other rice to make its shipment or storage more efficient.  
- In Physics, this is like the quantization of waves into packets. 

**Cognition** is the result of many thoughts together as one network or structure of thought-objects. 
- This is why "cognize" isn't used often.
- Recognize is to affirm the thought-structure already existing

**Intuition** is the getting of that actual integration through a weak Positive aethereal energy.

**Realization** is the getting of that integration through a strong Positive aethereal energy.

Cognition, Intuition, and Realization are all Flow and Force, with emphasis on Flow.

**Memorizing** is the storage of the idea-nodes as memory. All memory first goes into the aethereal memory of the Higher Mind. This is like cloud storage in cloud computing. 
- Then it is stored physically in the brain as local storage.
- This aethereal memory is called akashic records. 
- This uses Force and Memory -- extremely shocking events naturally etch themselves into our brains and akashic memory.

**Learning** is the storage of the idea-nodes after they have been integrated by the Higher Mind. 
- This is Flow and Memory.

Genius is a state of mind that has enough subtlety to access the higher mind easily.

Stupidity is a state of mind that has no access to the higher mind and is confined to the lower mind. For example, a stupid mind would answer `1 + 1 = 11` because it has no access to a new idea of `2`. 

Enlightenment is a state of mind that has made contact with the subtlest waves in the higher mind. This allows it to penetrate the cruder waves which create Maya or the illusion of physical existence. 


In terms of feeling-waves:
- **expression and feedback** is the process of integrating external and internal feeling-waves to create harmony
  - Expression is the Negative
  - Feedback and assimilation is the Positive
- **peace** is the actual integration of these feeling-waves to create harmony between the internal and external waves
 

<!-- Force is tasked with the return trip towards the origin, as a wave that has 4 properties: -->

<!-- The previous chapters explained that:
- Existence is in the mind for the purpose of being experienced by the perceiver or consciousness
- A mind can only be active or inactive, just as consciousness can only be be `on` or `off`
- Desire, as a type of feeling and effect of the Two Forces, is the engine for the creation of anything in existence 
- All Existence is then made up of ideas and feelings molded by the Two Forces
  - Ideas are sensed by the mind's intellect 
  - Feelings are sensed by the mind's heart  -->


In thinking, the mind-node adjusts its own configuration in order to match the structure or pattern of the nodes that flow through it.

This is because nodes are just bunched-up waves. And so they can recur just like waves do.
