Chapter 6 explained that reality is made up of perception-relations between identities. 

These then allow long chains of causes and effects, called by the Hindus as ''karma-samskara-karma'. 

A long series of chains gains the dynamics of a wave. This wave we can split into 3 states, matching the 3 Gunas or Influences:

1. Karma-Action, as State 1
2. Samskara-Pending, as Pseudo-State
3. Karma-Reaction, as State 2

We can extend this wave to have more states.

{{< img src="/graphics/super/wave.jpg" alt="Wave" cap="A wave is made up of many different states which reveal a hidden focus or dharma which we call a 'gravitational signature' to make it sound scientific" >}}


We can know why State 4 is the way it is if we look at all its states from 1 to 4. We can then use this knowledge to predict its future states. We can write this as:

```elixir
State 1 : State 2 : State 3 :: State 4
```


We do not notate the pseudostates that are in between:
- state 1 and 2
- state 2 and 3
- state 3 and 4

This is because they are pending reactions and have no objective manifestation in reality YET.  


The colon means 'relative to' or 'compared to', and is a fundamental part of our proposed 'Qualimath'. 


This is a combination of the ideas from:
- The Asian sciences of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism which say that everything is one (i.e. we can connect everything with a relational chain)
- Socratic philosophy which explains about the One and the Other
- Descartes' theory of gravity which says that gravity is a relation between bodies
- Poincare's Law of Relativity which is based on changing states of bodies in a system


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 4, Article 202" >}}
I deny the existence of gravity inside any body. Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.
{{< /q >}}


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/relationality.jpg" a="Relationality" >}}

We call this Cartesian [relationality](/relationality), which depends on point of view:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 3, Article 13" >}}
Imagine a ship being carried out to sea. A person sitting at the stern might always remain in one place if we look at the parts of the ship, since he preserves the same location with respect to these. On the other hand, if we look at the neighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually changing place. We see him constantly receding from one shore and approaching another. If the earth moves from west to east exactly as the ship moves from east to west, we again say that the person at the stern does not change his place. This is because his place will be determined by certain immovable points in the heavens. 
{{< /q >}}


In this way, relationality is built into even the most elementary equations, such as those taught for kids. Rather, it is baked into Descartes' 2nd Rule of Motion which is about state-change instead of inertia. And so we can safely throw away everything that Einstein made.

This is different from normal math which uses 'deltas'.
- Those deltas compare the object with itself at different states.
- This is because math focuses on the object itself, and not on the totality of the reality where that object is in.


### Math Versus Qualimath

For example, a basic math equation is `1 + 1 = 2`. This can be visualized by:

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/line.jpg" alt="Line" cap="Addition of distance leads to a new location, or the addition of self-instances leads to more instances" >}}

Notice how this is overly simplistic and does not expand on cause and effect. This is because math uses a constricted mindset that really relies on the Conservation of Ideas. 

This is why math-people can flip or transpose things. For example, `1 + 1 = 2` can be transposed to `2 = 1 + 1`. This is because the `=` sign "conserves` the values on both sides. 

The problem is that this is for closed, finite things and does not work for things that cross over to the aethereal layer. For example, the mass of a subatomic particle might be:

`1 + 1 = 2.0000123`

Math will be unable to explain where the `.0000123` came from, which Superphysics explains could come from the upper layers or by abnormal properties of the particle in certain situations. 

To fix this, we turn `1 + 1 = 2` into qualimath by adding the necessary parts:

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/linequali.jpg" alt="Line" cap="We qualimath a line. The addition of distance leads to a new location from local-motion (this is a Spinoza perspective), or the addition of self-instances leads to a new self (this is a David Hume perspective)" >}}

Here, we expose that the focus of the equation or line is itself. The qualimath ratio is `State 1 :: State 2` which we deconstruct as:

`(1 + 1) :: 2`

This leads to the same output as the `1 + 1 = 2` of normal math, while imposing the following mental changes:

- `1 + 1` is a rigid ratio of `2`, not an equality. It means it is confined to specific layer and does not cross over to other layers. This is useful when it comes to constants 
<!-- This makes it flexible and anti-dogma. -->
- Both sides have the same importance
- A straight-line equation would imply that the focus or dharma is on the line itself. A curved or wavy line would have its dharma harder to expose. 
  - A straight-line equation is like a person who goes to McDonalds to order a cheeseburger specifically
  - A curve equation is like a person who orders a cheeseburger then changes his order to a chicken meal then changes to a chicken burger as a compromise between his 2 previous orders. His dharma is neither burger nor chicken, but chicken burger

### The Ratio and Rigid Ratio

The ratio signs are derived from programming which uses `=`, `==`, and `===`

- `=` is assignment. This is similar to our `:` 
- `==` is loose equality. This is similar to our `::`
- `===` is strict equality. This is similar to our `=` 
{{< /b >}}


The concept of a *focus* is super important as it is the basis of:
- [gravitational signatures](/material/principles/intro/chapter-02)
- the hierarchy of the universe
- Descartes' [First and Third Rules of Motion](/material/motion) 

But for `1 + 1 = 2.0000123`, we use a different ratio:

`(1 + 1) : 2.0000123`

This means that the inequality is caused by something unknown. Provisionally, we fix this with:

`(1 + 1) : 0.0000123 aether :: 2.0000123`

The `0.0000123 aether` is a value from the aethereal layer that is affecting the relationship. 


## A More Complex Example

Let's say we want to convert `17 * 19 = 323` to Qualimath. This will create 3 states in our sandbox:

- State 1 for `17`
- Pseudo-state or action for `19`
- State 2 for the `answer`

We notate this as `(State 1 * action) :: State 2`, deconstructed as `(17 * 19) :: answer` 

We use Egyptian Math, as Al-Khwarizmis algorithms, to deconstruct `17` (State 1) into its doubles as a ratio of the doubles of `19` (action).



State 1: 17 | Action: 19 
--- | ---
**1** | **19**
2 | 38
4 | 76
8 | 152
**16** | **304**

{{< youtube wciL_yCmZe8 >}}


We use State 1 as the focus and add the corresponding values in the `action`* to get State 2 as `323`**. 


{{< b >}}
*Action is a pseudo state of State 1 that allowed the change. Without that pseudo-state, then State 1 would stay close minded and not be open to change and therefore remain as State 1 instead of changing to State 2.  

*`323` = `304` [as 5th row of State 2 or `16`] + `19` [as 1st row of State 1 or `1` to get `17`]
<!-- We can add to this equation such as multiplying `323` by `2` to get `646`. -->
{{< /b >}}


Here, the smaller number is put before the larger. In case of multiple multipliers, the first 2 are combined then rearranged, then multiplied with the latter multipliers. 
<!-- This smaller-to-higher arrangement is similar to  -->


This use of states, foci, and arrangements greatly simplifies math instead of making it boring and burdensome.
