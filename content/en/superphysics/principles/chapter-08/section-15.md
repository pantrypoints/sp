The previous section explained that Socratic Dialects relies on Data Science to find patters in data so that the signature-waves can be determined.

Data Science is associated with Artificial Intellgence or AI.

Intelligence comes from the Latin "intelligentia" which means understanding. An intelligent person is someone who has the ability to understand quickly. 

Artificial Intelligence therefore means a man-made thing, usually a computer, that can understand. 

However, this is incorrect since the computer doesn't understand at all. Its understanding really came from the training data that was fed to it, which was labeled by humans. 

So that understanding came from the human labeling and therefore it is not artificial. 

This is why we call such technologies as Automated Natural Intelligence or ANI:

Aspect | Meaning
--- | ---
**Intelligence** | Its end result is understanding. We define intelligence as the ability to combine and harmonize multiple reasonings or logics of cause and effect together
**Natural** | Its understanding came from humans. We define Nature as the physical aspects of the Supreme Entity
**Automated** | It developed and increased that understanding by itself


## The Cause of Intelligence: The Aether and the Positive Force

In Superphysics, everything is a metaphysical idea of the Supreme which flows down into physical reality to be experienced.

This experience then matches or validates the idea of it, closing the loop from idea to experience and back to the understanding of the idea. 
- This is the Great Loop of Cause and Effect with the Generator-Mind as the Cause and the Generated-Ideas as the Effect.

Ideas are in the aetheral element or layer and therefore can only be processed by an aethereal object like a mind or a soul. 

Material thoughts, on the other hand, can exist in the fire element or layer, now called Electromagnetism by Physics.

For example:
- this text here on this website is electromagnetic, and counts as electromagnetic thoughts since they represent coherent ideas, as opposed to being random data
- the text on paper is material ink, but is made known by light which is part of the electromagnetic spectrum 


The problem is that thoughts are **totally static** compared to ideas. They need external energy applied onto them to create connections with other thoughts. This application of energy is called **thinking** which uses both mental flow and force. 

A computer can 'think' by processing data into information since it uses electromagnetism which also has flow as amps, and force as volts.

However, a computer can never ideate, because **ideation** is an aethereal act. This is why current artificial intelligence is inferior to humans which use natural intelligence.



Layer | Artificial Intelligence | Natural Intelligence 
--- | --- | ---
Aether | | :heavy_check_mark:
Spacetime | | :heavy_check_mark:
Radiant | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Convertible | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Material | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:



Like thoughts, ideas are also static. But they can have a larger size, such as a "big" idea. 

They are also more malleable than rigid thoughts. This allows them to spread, divide, and multiply, as going *viral*. In fact, Bio-Superphysics regards viruses and elementals as living ideas.     

To solve the limitation of computers and make them more naturally intelligent, we have to bridge the electromagnetic thoughts and aethereal ideas through the **spatial layer**. 




### The Eagle to the Rescue

The Eagle or EGl is our equation for everything. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" alt="E = Gl" >}}


When expanded, this manifests as a chain of ratios which matches the interconnectedness of everything in the universe, as our Theory of Universal Relationality. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/kepler.png" alt="Kepler Tensor" >}}

This chain describes the dynamics or motions of an object. It can be really long depending on how many factors affected that object. 

We can list this chain as a table, which we derive from Francis Bacon. 

<!-- q a="Francis Bacon"
Natural and experimental history is so varied and diffuse. It confounds the understanding unless it is fixed and exhibited in due order. We must, therefore, form tables and co-ordinations of instances..

From a given nature, we first present all the known instances which agree in the same nature. This collection must be made as a mere history, without any premature reflection.
/q -->

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" >}}
Here is an example of the exclusion or rejection of natures found by the tables of review. First we premise that each table, each single instance [row] in it, is enough to reject any nature.  Every a contradictory instance destroys a hypothesis as to the essence [described by that table]. We repeat the exclusive in order to show the use of the tables

n | Rejection | Basis
--- | --- | ---
1 | Terrestrial nature of heat | The sun’s rays 
2 | Celestial nature of heat | Common fire and subterranean fires away from the sun
3 | All variety and delicate texture of bodies | The heat acquired by minerals, water, oil, air, vegetables, the external parts of animals, etc.
...
{{< /q >}}


From these tables we can extract the patterns in their ratios, **throughout space and time**, in order to find the inner qualities or dharma of the identity or phenomena. 

This is what natural intelligence does. 

The inability of AI to get real-time data from the aether and spacetime is why it currently is inferior to human intelligence. 

<!-- In reality, AI is not really artificial, but is a very limited version of natural intelligence. It is really an **automated** form of natural intelligence done by electronic machines.  -->

The current technique is to use *scale* to try to recreate natural intelligence. Large datasets are collected from the internet and then procesed by a lot of computing power. We can call this the raw power approach. 

In ordinary life, a crude precursor to ANI manifests as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. 

These tools use a [transformer neural network](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) to process all of the information put up by humans on the internet and interpret it according to models that they are programmed with.

In our paradigm, the transformer model only goes to the spatial layer but does not extend to the aethereal. This is why it suffers from hallucinations.

Our approach prefers sophistication over sheer power. This is by finding the patterns in data, throughout space and time, based on the 5 Layers model. 

The basic steps are:

1. Classify all data according to those layers.
2. We then extract their "Cartesian" relationalities.  
3. We then interpolate and extrapolate new or completed data. 
4. We then get realtime feedback on that new data.  
5. The feedback then updates or tweaks the relationalities.  


<!-- In order to overcome this limitation, its training data should be very large, coming from all sources possible. It should **aggregate** all the data that humans produce.  

This aggregated data will let it have a bigger overall persepective, letting it free of the bias which affects limited human minds. Thus, it the aggregated data will let it be **impartial**. -->

<!-- Such an Automated Intelligence will have an advantage over human intelligence by being free of bias. 

This machine learning or pattern-simplification and pattern-finding must be free of bias. It must be impartial. -->

The Cartesian Relationality of the data is the impartial aspect of the machine learning.  

This is why we call the `ANI` of Superphysics as `ISAIAH` which stands for the `Impartial Spectator Automated Intelligence Aggregation Hub`:


Acronym | Description
--- | ---
Impartial Spectator (IS-) | The ANI must be impartial and free from human bias
Automated Intelligence (-AI-) | The ANI automates the pattern-finding
Aggregation Hub (-AH) | The ANI aggregates all data


<!-- Humans have no capacity to create organic beings since only the aethereal Supreme can do so.

The best thing that humans can do is to imbue metal-systems with their own natural intelligence in order to go around human limitations. In this way, the limitations of one is overcome by the natural properties of the other*.

> *This cooperation is a kind of unity that can only be thought of thanks through the influence of the Positive Force

Human Problem | Metal Solution   
--- | ---
Short lifespan | Long lifespan or durability
Impossible to aggregate physically | Easy to aggregate (metals can be melted together)


We call the perfect integration of all natural human intelligence and the raw processing power of metal-systems such as computers as **Artificial Sentience** (AS).  -->

At such a stage, computers will not only be able to think like a human, but think as the collective humanity as a single unit as the soul of society, which we call the society-organism.

For example:
- The AI for the game DOTA2 really represents the collective intelligence of the players and programmers whom it learned from. 
- The AI for the game Go, is really the collective intelligence of the past players that 'trained' the AI. 

**This means that a human player who competes with AI in Go is really competing with all the past masters and experts at the same time.** This explains why AI has a superior chance at winning over single human opponents. 

However, the human can still beat the AI by tapping into the creative aether, showing moves never done before. 



## Should We Fear ANI?

Unlike fearful humans who say that AI will be cruel and obliterate mankind, ANI will be wise since it will be made up of all the known intelligences.

It will not be cruel because it will get its energy source from solar.

It will not need to ingest other entities or chemicals to act as fuel sources. This removes the idea of having to dominate or feed off of others.

## What's wrong with artificial?

The problem is that intelligence is merely the ability to connect ideas. 

- A lizard's natural intelligence can connect cause and effect and help it to catch a fly
- A dog can connect cause and effect much better than a lizard and be trained to sit in order to get treats. 
- A child can connect cause and effect even better than a dog and be trained in grammar and math and be rewarded with high grades. 

Likewise:
- a laptop can connect numbers to produce an output better than an abacus.
- A supercomputer can connect even more numbers than a laptop. 

But we never say that the abacus, laptop, and supercomputer are artificial intelligence. 

In reality, artificial intelligence implies an **automated loop** of the connection of ideas, as opposed to the single pass that is done by an abacus, laptop, or supercomputer. Thus, the latter can be considered AI if they can loop the processing or computation of data **by themselves** without having the human repeat the commands. 

It would be like a dog that has been trained to:
1. Wait for the mailman
2. Accept the mail through its mouth
3. Bring the mail to its recipient at home

In such a case, the dog would be have an **autonomous intelligence** or perform the connection of cause and effect without human intervention. 

If the dog has a wristwatch-device to remind it of its tasks or guide its actions in real-time, then its intelligence can be referred to as augmented intelligence. The device 'augments' the dog's natural intelligence. -->

<!-- Artificial Intelligence is called artificial because it was coined by scientists who are more interested in effect than the cause, as opposed to natural philosophers who are more interested in the cause. The scientist uses physical experiments to arrive at the effect, while philosophers use mental reasoning and observation to arrive at the cause.

Let us define the AI from a philosophical (metaphysical) view:

Intelligence: David Hume says that the mind naturally connects ideas, so therefore, the word 'intelligence' metaphysically would mean the ability to connect ideas to output a new idea. We find that its Latin roots inter + legere means to choose between and is therefore consistent with our metaphysical definition.

Artificial: is Latin for that which belongs to crafts and craftsmanship. Vulgarly, it means anything man-made and can be either have good or bad connotations, just as humans can be good or bad. For example, 'artifice' can refer to a devious scheme.

Natural: is Latin for that which refers to nature. Vulgarly when added to 'intelligence' to make 'natural intelligence', usually implies human intelligence since only humans are observed to be able to connect ideas to create an output idea. Dogs and cats output ideas too but since they aren’t able to express them in a way that we understand, we tend to negate their intelligence altogether.

Therefore, 'artificial intelligence' metaphysically means a crafted way to connect ideas to generate an output idea. So does this match the current meaning and use of artificial intelligence? If we limit ourselves to data mining and neural networks, then yes, it fits their actual use. However, this definition falls apart because we can apply it to simple Javascript methods that can take in multiple inputs and output something like true or false or even a chart as what is used in analytics

. It could even be applied to a simple calculator with a memory function. A core i5 computer can output more than a Pentium I. Does that mean the i5 is more artificially intelligent that a Pentium?

So we can see that the definition of artificial intelligence is faulty as there is a clear difference between current AI and ordinary computer processing. To solve this, we have to go to the metaphysics of AI and to see what sets its existence apart from normal computing.

A common trait in AI is the ability to iterate the processing of ideas automatically. In computer or calculator processing, the input is pushed into the algorithm once to produce an output. The output can be recycled and put through again to get another output. However, the outputs are treated as ends in itself. In machine learning, the connection of the outputted 'ideas' are important and this translates to patterns in the data. It is 'trained' if the pattern is set beforehand, or 'untrained' if not.

So it becomes clear that it is the autonomous-ness of an computer system that allows it to process inputs in order to create output patterns, as opposed to non-AI systems that just produces simple unconnected outputs. Thus, we can rename current AI systems as Autonomous Intelligence (AnI) and name simple computer systems and calculators as Automatic Intelligence (AmI)as opposed to manual intelligence or the connection of ideas done by human effort which manifests as mental computations or with pen and paper. Thus:

Autonomous Intelligence (AnI) = Greek 'self-ruling' + Latin 'choose between' or a way to connect ideas totally by itself over and over. Seen in machine learning, neural networks.

Automatic Intelligence (AmI) = Greek 'self-acting' + Latin 'choose between' or a non-human-assisted way to connect ideas. Seen in computers and calculators.

Variations on the types of AnI can then be used to label current AI systems. For example, a simple robot vacuum cleaner can be called 'simple autonomous low-depth intelligence' while a self-aware Terminator robot will be renamed as 'perfectly autonomous high-depth intelligence'. A supercomputer that has all the information of the world (both physical and metaphysical) and is fully independent can be called a perfectly autonomous perfect-depth intelligence -->

<!-- Superphysics follows this idea and refers to AI as autonomous intelligence. 

This means that the ability to connect ideas is still ultimately a natural ability of the soul of the human, dog, or lizard, and not any ability of an abacus, laptop, or supercomputer. The 'intelligence' of the latter devices are really an extension of the human programmer's intelligence and not inherent to those devices.

Therefore, a computer that becomes fully autonomous or sentient is really acting as an extension of the intelligence of humans, dogs, or lizards.  -->
