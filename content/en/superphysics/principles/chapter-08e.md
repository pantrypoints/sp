The root cause in the limitations in Physics (and consequently, in the technologies that humans can develop) is the seeming limited ability of humans to perceive beyond the Fire Element (electromagnetism and light).

Beyond the Fire Element is the Air (Space and Time) and the Aether Elements (Idea).
- These 2 Elements are totally subjective and dynamic.

<!-- The real cause of the absurdity is the scientific decree to make things measurable.  -->

<!-- Objective measurements are based on light giving our natural light-detectors (eyes) objective information.  -->

For example:
- The distance from House A to House B can be denoted in meters, yards, feet, etc.
- An idea can be important to some, but not important to others.  

We say that such measurements are subjective and heterogenous. Thus, they are more qualitative instead of quantitative or homogenous.

Hence, tanmátras [quantum-perceptions] are the waves produced by the objects as a result of reflection of the subtler bhúta [element or factor] on the cruder ones. Quantum-perceptions in the mathematical sense are **heterogeneous**, not homogeneous
{{< /q >}}


We can say that: 
- The Fire and Earth Elements, as electromagnetism and atoms (strong force) focus on quantitative particles, and make up the Physical Domain
- The Air and Aether Elements, as spacetime and ideas focus on qualitative waves, and make up the Metaphysical Domain

The smallest measuring tool:
- for the physical domain is the electron
- for the metaphysical domain is idea

Therefore, idea solves the measurement problem. 

<!--  wich c as the ghighest kind of ruler. The wohole big giat problem is that the aetehr is above spacetime whtih itselfis above lectromagentism. So The aether is not measurebale by sight or electronic eqiupement fof the electomagneic layer and is onlyindirectly measurable by the spacetime layer. 

This neesd a whole new math which we call qualimath which measures chanigng aetereal qualities instead of discrete material quantities.  -->

<!-- We can further simplify math by  -->

## Qualimath

An idea is qualitative, not quantitive. 

For example, the idea of demoracy has similar qualities to the idea of liberalism and the opposite qualities of tyranny.  

The idea of demoracy is closer to the idea of economy than the idea of a potato. There is no way to quantify the difference between democracy and potato, or democracy as a system of government versus democracy as freedom. 

We thus assign qualities to our deconstructed equations. 

<!-- This is also because waves are more qualitative than quantitative in nature.    -->

<!-- To get around this shortage, we will use *the qualitative aspects of waves* that combines its qualities such as amplitude, oscillation, vector, wavelength, etc.  -->

For example, in `Wave 1 + Wave 2 = Wave 3`, we assign qualities instead of numbers and processes so we can arrive at the general outcome faster. 

The `+` and `=` represent the natural actions of the human mind. The minds of less advanced species, such as penguins, might be capable of `+` and `-`, but are not capable of `*` or `/`. 

Likewise, human minds seem to be limited to `=` and do not dwell so much on `:` which reqresents the hidden connection between things.*

{{< n n="*Bio Superphysics explains this to be caused by humans eating crude food such as meat which then crudifies the thinking process." >}}


<!-- Since it deals with qualities instead of quantities, we can call it **Decon Notation** and its underlying system as **Quali-math**.  -->

This solves measurement problems by allowing anyone to create a *subjective* measure. For example, assuming a predefined intuitive range of qualitative* values which *focus* on looks:


``` elixir
abominable, hideous, very ugly, ugly, unattractive, soso, pretty, beautiful, very beautiful, gorgeous, drop-dead gorgeous
```

{{< f f="*Qualities are subjective" >}}


Then we can create equations:

``` elixir
pretty + pretty = beautiful
beautiful + 2(ugly) = ugly
hideous + beautiful = ugly
```

This can then be “translated” into any language*:

``` elixir
maganda + maganda = sobrang ganda
kaakit-akit + kadiri = napaka-pangit
dep + dep = rat dep
```

<!-- In a future post, we will expand this into chemical compounds computation, and in linear algebra to produce general qualitative outcomes instead of exact quantitative answers.  -->

A sample implementation is our use of [male and female charges](/material/principles/part-3/chapter-04/) for particles instead of the "positive and negative" used by Benjamin Franklin. In theory, this would lead to new chemical compounds that are unthinkable in Physics, since it is more intuitive to combine different kinds of males with different kinds of females. 

This quali-math will make the most sense when you think of a spaceship using quantum teleportation that not only will use 2D space as in a car on Earth or a 3D space like an aircraft, but a space with 4 or 5 dimensions as time-multiverses and alternative universes, where normal math breaks down.

For example, `1 + 1 = 2` might be true for this universe, but it might not be true for a different universe where `1 + 1 = 1` or where the conception of two ideas automatically merges them into one idea. In such a universe, it is the mind that splits itself into different perception-units in order to create the idea of numbers. This is the opposite in our universe, where the perceiving entity is one, and the it is the observed entities that are multiples and discrete. 


## The Double Colon as Mirror

To account for this mind-splitting behavior, <!--  make ratios and relationality permanent, --> we propose a new notation using flexible colons instead of the rigid equals sign. The former represents the flexible nature of the universe as opposed to its strict rigidity as the latter.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/math.jpg" alt="Mathematics" >}}

- The single colon is like a flexible ratio. You can think of this as a hazy mirror that lets the other side look a bit different 
- The double colon is like a rigid equals sign. This is a clearer mirror but still not a perfect reflection.
- The triple colon is a strict equality that involves the kinds of data*. This is a perfect mirror. 


{{< n n="*In programming this is similar to =, ==, and ===. Notice how we are coercing math to follow computer programming" >}}

### The Theory of Universal Relationality

This ratio represents our theory of "universal relationality*" which is represented in reality by [gravitational relationality](/material/principles/part-2/chapter-04), among others.

All philosophers say that everything is connected, even the sophistical pseudo-philosopher John Stuart Mill. 

The ratio sign signifies this connection. 

In this way, we can say that the universe is an unending chain of multiple layered ratios, as a matrix, where a change in one part causes a change in the whole universe as a chain-effect. This is because in Cartesian Physics, which is one basis of Superphysics, there is no void in Nature (i.e. God is everywhere in Spinoza-speak). 

The lower dimensions like ours has more rigid ratios that lead to discrete and 'hardened' identities, while higher dimensions have more flexible ratios that lead to more malleable ones.

Since the lower dimensions are more stubborn, they require more effort and energy to change than the upper dimensions. So it makes sense for enlightened entities to spend their energy going into the higher dimensions instead of wasting energy in the lower dimensions trying to convince crude-minded materialists that God exists or that the universe is conscious. 


#### Update March 10, 2022

An example of the "hardness" of this dimension is the hardness of will of Russia in invading Ukraine and in Ukraine stubbornly not giving up, not caring about the chain-reaction that it causes to other nations and the planet. 

In a better universe (with qualimath as the norm), Russia, Ukraine, and NATO will "soften" their minds and egos (less strong force, more gravitational force) as to harmonize with each other, being more sensible how their actions affect the planet.

In this universe, such a softening can be encouraged by emphasizing the abstract, flexible aether, over rigid and hard solid matter.
