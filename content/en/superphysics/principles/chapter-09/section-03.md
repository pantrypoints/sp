The previous section explained that the feeling process uses flow and force, with emphasis on force. 

The goal of feeling is peace which the mind achieves through equanimity and self-mastery. 

Peace, harmony, and satisfaction are all effects of the Positive Force just as distress and conflict effects of the Negative. 
- The former are based on the Hgher Mind, just as the latter are based on the Lower Mind blocking off access to the Higher Mind through the Negative Force 


## Sensitivity, Reflection, Empathy, Discernment, Ideation

In order to elucidate the feeling process, we need to define concepts related to it.

- **Sensitivity** is the awareness of emotions. 

- **Reflection** is the use of sensitivity to realize the causal and effective emotions in general.

- **Self-control** is the ability to combine and harmonize multiple emotions together.

- **Discernment** is reflection on the individual emotions that make up a compound feeling in order to get the whole picture or understanding of it
  - Examples of discernment are assessment of moral actions, taste, beauty, music, manners. 

- **Ideation** is reflection on the structure of the compound emotion into its components in order to get the whole picture or understanding of being
  - Examples of ideation are goal-setting, creation of vision-mission, visualization of ideal outcomes such as dream job, ideal spouse, perfect home, etc 

  - **Affirmations** are emotions used to aid ideations as guideposts and direction signs to control the traffic or flow of feeling. 

  - **Meditation** is ideation using affirmations and other techniques to understanding the nature or essemce of the self or something

  - **Self-Realization** or **Samadhi** is the final result of meditation, with the soul as the end product.


These definitions harmonize with those related to thinking:

Thinking Process | Feeling Process
--- | ---
Logic (Connection of ideas) | Sensitivity (Awareness of emotions)
Reasoning (Logic for cause/effect) | Reflection (Sensitivity to realize causal/effective emotions)
Intellect (Harmonize multiple reasonings) | Empathy (Harmonize multiple external emotions)
Induction (Reasoning from individual ideas to get the whole picture) | Discernment (Reflection on individual emotions to the whole picture)
Deduction (Reasoning from the compound idea to its components) | Ideation (Reflection on compound emotion to its components)
Syllogisms (Idea-guideposts for deductive reasoning) | Affirmations (Emotion-words used as guideposts for ideation)
Inquiry (Deduction on syllogisms to undertand compound idea) | Meditation (Ideation using affirmations to understand essence)
Realization (Result of Inquiry) | Samadhi or Self-Realization (Result of Meditation)
Knowledge (Product of Realization) |  Peace (Product of Samadhi)


## Ideation (Feeling Deduction) and Discernment (Feeling Induction)

**Ideation** is a way of reflecting that starts with a big emotion then working to fill the details and relations.

A common example is goal-setting. We wake up and go to work because we feel we need to achieve a certain goal that is not achieved by being unemployed.

A recent trend is career-pathing as done by mentors or "life coaches". In schools, children are asked what they want to be when they grow up.

**Discernment** is a way of reflecting that starts with current emotion-preceptions then working to paint the overall emotion. 

An common example is moral actions. When someone hurts someone, we can choose to ignore it or defend the hurt person. We do not really think about the rational consequences or even get more information before we react. 

Here, the discernment time is very short. But when we suddenly get a job offer out of the blue, without our aiming or ideation for it, then we use feeling-discernment to decide whether we should accept it or not.


<!-- Induction is a way of reasoning that starts the component ideas and connecting them and finding relations in order to form the total concept as understanding or knowledge.

Intuition and realization is the mind arriving at, or flowing into, the knowledge immediately. This can be done without the thinking process, or as a result of the thinking process. Rather the thinking process fights the Negative Force so that intuition can flow down naturally to the Lower Mind. This is like removing blockages from a filthy pipe so that water can flow again. -->

Concept | Example
--- | ---
Ideation (feeling deduction) | What company should I set up? What is my ideal company?
Thinking deduction | The nitty gritty ideas or details of that company
Discernment (feeling induction) | What conflicting feelings do I have for what the company should be?
Thinking Induction | Surveying the resources that you actually have


Materialism and the Negative Force have prevailed in the world for many centuries. This is why discernment is emphasized over ideation. Though recently, spirituality and the Positive Force seems to be increasing. This is why movements like the Law of Attraction and Mindfulness are slowly gaining traction. 
- Discernment will be discussed in Chapter 10 as part of morality
- Ideation will be discussed in Chapter 11 as part of spirituality


<!-- Likewise, we use our feelings and moral sense whenever we need to address a moral issue. 

An example is when a beggar asks us for money. 
- Some say we should give money so that he can buy things to ease his suffering. 
- Some say we should not give money because it will breed dependence and he might spend it for drugs or gambling.

If we were omniscient, then we would know the beggar's real situation and decide immediately if we should give money or not. 

Unfortunately, we are not omniscient. And so our moral decisions are not always correct. We might feel that we are helping the beggar by giving or not giving, but in reality, we might be making his situation worse. 

Ordinary feeling is the application of our feelings in the ordinary way within our usual limitations. 

We can say that critical feeling is the application of feeling with an added effort to push against or break through such limitation. 

This happens when we pause our ego or feeling of the self and put our minds in the situation of the other person. In our example, this is done by putting ourselves in the situation of the beggar. 

We do this by talking to him and asking him his situation, story, feelings now and in the past, his relations, etc. From these, our minds can create a better picture whether he is really in need of money, or he is just scamming people.   -->
