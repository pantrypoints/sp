The previous section explained how group feeling can be used to harmonize the self with the soul.

This is why human happiness is primarily based on relationships. 

This is because relationality is the key mechanism that exposes the unity of Existence as the single Supreme Entity.  

This relationality manifests as social relationships which then leads to fellow feeling and consequently the common interest which serves as the conscience of society.

## Symbiosis

We defined a society as a metaphysical organism which has a physical component as the physical bodies that make up its members.  
In the animal and plant worlds, the social structure improves the maintenance of those bodies by tapping the advantages of each member, as symbiosis. 

A symbiosis is a mutually advantageous exchange of resources or services. 

We can say that it is the barter of the plant and animal world. 

The main requirement for such exchange is the communication between parties. 

Communication is an exchange of information that involves perception and expression.

Animals and plants can communicate with each other not through complex ideas, but through simple feelings. 

In this case, feelings serve as information.
