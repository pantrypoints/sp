Socratic Dialectics combines critical thinking, as creative out-of-the-box reasoning, and critical feeling, as fellow-feeling. 
- Critical thinking thinks outside of limited beliefs
- Critical feeling feels beyond the self
- Ordinary thinking is hampered by limitations created by beliefs
- Ordinary feeling is hampered by limitations of the self


This makes Socratic Dialectics our main tool to solve problems that have afflicted the current systems which are selfish and limited because of the pervasiveness of the Materialist Disease.

This is seen in the current education system which emphasizes the development of the brain and critical thinkng. It develops the heart less. 

This is because the world seems to be in a dark ages dominated by the Negative Force instead of the Positive. We point the start of this to the French Revolution which separated Church from State and consequently Philosophy from Science. 

The root cause of that Revolution was the ignorance of the West on metaphysics. This ignorance led it to create the Catholic religion which often goes against science and the nature things.

The problem is that that ignorance came from the Negative Force. The success of the French Revolution therefore led to the spread of Negativity from the 19th century onwards, naturally leading to world wars and economic crises in the 20th century which persist until today. 

<!-- 
The problem is that the Negative Force (the force that is tasked to create reality) is designed to limit and compress things. This limitation is seen in the ego in actively-conscious entities*. 

> *It is actually strongest in non-living (non-actively-conscious) entities. For example, a knife that is used to stab a person will not feel any guilt in being the cause of the person's suffering, because it is unable to express feelings by design.   -->

The French Revolution led to the concept of Liberalism which gives importance to the self instead of society. It is a backwards evolution, from advanced into backwards.

This leads to egotistic people and egotistic countries that feel so much for themselves and so little for others. It reduces the chances of critical feeling and increases the chances of critical thinking or intellectualization. 

This intellectualization now manifests as the emphasis of the educational system on brain development, intellect, and the 5 senses, at the expense of the heart, fellow-feelings, and intution or the 6th sense. 

<!-- This ego is the feeling of the self and manifests as 'I' or 'me'. Too much Negative Force will lead to a strong ego which values only 'me, me, me', instead of other entities. In this state, there is no critical analysis of one's feelings -- an egotistic person just does what he does without anaylzing his feelings behind it. 

Ideally, this critical feeling should be done by the heart as a sixth or intuitional sense. The problem is that heart is commonly overpowered by the other five senses:

- sight
- touch
- hearing
- smell
- taste

These send their data to the brain which can receive five data streams for every one feeling stream from the heart.  -->

 
## Superphysics Closes the Gap Between Intellect and Feelings

Human hearts lead us to errors because the Western educational system, spread globally through colonization, has focused on brain development and not on heart development. This leads to:
- physicists using their intellect to create nuclear weapons
- the recommendations of intelligent climate scientists being ignored
- mathematicians using their intellect to game the stock market

<!-- The odd quirk in the human species is that our brain and heart are far apart. This creates a distance or lag that makes ideas  appear totally different from feelings. This then makes human action lack feelings for others, as seen in terrorism, nuclear weapons, deforestation, etc.  -->

To push for heart development, and the increase in common-interest and fellow-feeling, Superphysics proposes to close the distance between the brain and the heart by:
- visualizing feelings and ideas. 
  - This is because sight is the main sensor of the brain. 
  - This will be done through the aethereal Cartesian plane. 
  - This visualization of ideas and feelings will better reveal the gravitational signature in each concept, phenomenon, person, group, society, etc.
- profiling people based on their personality structure which contains their gravitational signature or configuration
  - This is shallowly done nowadays in the West by personality profiling and in Korea which puts labels on people 
- defining the feelings through Bio Superphysics
- promoting specific feelings through Social Superphysics
  - Humans already do this through TV, movies, powerpoint presentations, branding, packaging, advertising and other bright, shiny, catchy, fragrant, and tasty things that appeal to the senses located near the brain as the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue.

## Critical Thinking and Critical Feeling

In order to maximize our experience of Existence, it would be best to have both sensors running at 100% as much as possible. This means they should not just be passively sensing, but also **actively sensing**.

This active sensing is:
- the foundation of critical thinking (as intellect), as well as critical feeling (as kindness and fellow-feeling).
- a key component of Socratic Dialectics as part of the probing process

Currently, the educational systems in most countries mostly focus on intellect and is very deficient in fellow-feeling. This is proven by the prevalence of racism, terrorism, poverty & inequality, materialism, environmental destruction, etc. 

The glaring proof is the existence of mass shootings by young people in the West. It shows that their educational or cultural systems nurtured hate and division instead of fellow-feeling and unity. This problem does not exist so much in Asian* education or culture.   

{{< n n="*Instead of personal divisions, Asia has religious divisions that create religious conflict such as that between Hindus and Muslims in India, Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar, and Falun Gong versus the Chinese Communist Party. In Africa, the divisions are even more basic as being based on tribal lines, such as those seen in Rwanda, Sudan, and Ethiopia." >}}



Globally, this lack of fellow-feeling hurts even the intellectual sciences. For example, scientists have long had the data to prove that global warming causes disasters. Yet the feelings of the human species are extremely disunited, unable to drive collective action. 

The mere visualization or even 'audification' of feelings will not be enough to increase fellow-feeling. To deal with such large-scale non-feeling, Superphysics proposes many new concepts such as:
- Qualimath
- Constitutional Virtues
- 5 Interconnectivities
- 5 Layers of Medicine
- 4 Laws of Value
- 4 Social Cycles
- Points-based economy
- etc.

These unify the feelings of each person so that each one will discover his role in the greater plan of the universe, and appreciate the hidden value in the existence of each.

Is the plan of the universe in line with what we feel? 

This is answered by our intuition and conscience which will be explained in Chapter 10. 
<!-- - Conscience is the intuition or feeling for the dharma or true nature -->


## Our Solution: Let Automated Natural Intelligence (ANI) Support and Encourage Both Critical Thinking and Feeling

Nowadays, critical thinking is encouraged by data science wherein the data analyst must use different techniques to make sense of huge amounts of data. 

These techniques can also be applied onto the constant barrage of feelings that we get in order to make sense of them and unify them with the feelings of society as the public interest. This requires a classification of feelings, just as logic has a classification of truths and fallacies as red herring, false dilemma, non-sequitir, Occam's razor, etc.

An example of feeling-classification is the categorization of anger as:
- anger from disappointment
- anger from offense
- anger from frustration
- anger from betrayal
- and so on

These then drill down onto the causes of disappointment, offense, frustration, betrayal, etc. This will then make people aware whether some people have too-high expecations, excessive sentimentality, intemperance, or too much attachment, in order to prevent the probabiltiy of anger.   

<!-- humans think of happiness as an idea instead of as its true form which is a feeling. This is then due to the fact that of all our five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, four of them are close to the brain, the main thinking organ, and only one of them -touch-is close to the heart. When you hit your foot on the door, the impulse travels near your heart before it hits the brain. The pain-feeling is instantaneous. But when you see a beautiful person or object it takes a while to feel love-feeling for that person or object.

The dominance of the brain leads us to critical thinking. The distance of our heart from our brain leads to have confused feelings, slow feelings, and selfish feelings. 
and not an idea, then

Ego is the cause of evil.
Ego (ahamkara in Sanskrit) is the feeling of the self (jiva).

Critical feeling disconnects our mind from our ego.
