Material Superphysics explains that the physical phenomena on Earth such as storms and rain are caused by our sun and by gravitational effects from other massive bodies within our solar system.

Bio Superphysics explains that the social phenomena on Earth such as animal migration, economic crises, war, etc. are caused by starlight.

This is easily proven by starlight from the sun which we call sunlight.
- It makes human society wake up in the morning and sleep at night.

The effects of of the sun’s starlight is so obvious that we:
- take it for granted
- see it different from the starlight of distant stars

Starlight affects phenomena in 2 ways:

1. Quantity

This is light intensity. This includes solar flares that increase the radiation hitting Earth.

2. Quality

This is light color and color-change.  For example, Betelgeus is slowly changing from yellow to red.


## The Overview Effect

The **overview effect**:
- is a well-documented psychological phenomenon experienced by many astronauts when they view Earth from space. 
- was coined by space philosopher Frank White in his 1987 book *The Overview Effect*

It describes a sudden, overwhelming sense of awe, interconnectedness, and fragility upon seeing our planet from outer space.

Many astronauts describe Earth as a "fragile ball of life" or "a blue marble" with no national boundaries, fostering a deep sense of unity with humanity and a renewed commitment to environmental protection.


The astrology part of Bio Supeprhysics is based on:
- Johannes Kepler
- Vedic Astrology

Kepler was the 17th-century astronomer who formulated the laws of planetary motion and also gave his own principles for astrology.
- He believed celestial bodies exerted subtle effects on humans via light intensity, angles, and personal conditions.


### Why Science Sees Astrology as Unscientific 

Science only respects objective phenomena that are consistent. 

The problem is that in astrology:
- there are so many stars
- the stars are very far
- outer space is always changing 

This makes the effects of astrolgy inconsistent and therefore "unscientific".  

Bio Supeprhysics fixes this by making it a *support* for social cycles and not a fundamental part. It is like the cheese in cheesburger:
- The goodness of the cheeseburger is more in the patty than in the cheese. 
- The cheeseburger without cheese, as a hamburger, can still be great since the cheese only acts as support to make the good even better

Similarly, we want to tap into astrology to really make society better or to expose the things that make a bad society very evil, such as nationalist Germany being corrupted into Nazi Germany.

<!-- In René Descartes' physics, light carries information from the objects it reflects. Light hitting a red object diffuses "redness" to the observer. Extending this, planetary light could transmit "ideas" or qualities associated with those bodies. Humans receive this actively (through the eyes) or passively (via subtle energy centers like chakras).

From this perspective, the overview effect could be seen as Earth itself "speaking" through intense, direct sunlight and reflection—delivering a powerful message of care and unity to astronauts. The overwhelming light and view trigger a behavioral change, much like Kepler's idea of cosmic influences on human affairs.

#### Why This Interpretation Remains Speculative

While the overview effect is real and transformative, the astrological and Cartesian extensions are not supported by mainstream science. Astrology lacks empirical evidence for planetary influences beyond gravitational or tidal effects (far too weak for human behavior). Chakras, often linked to energy absorption, are rooted in spiritual traditions but not in measurable biology or physics—critics view them as metaphorical or pseudoscientific.

The overview effect's power likely stems from psychology: awe from vastness, cultural narratives, and the novelty of the view. Virtual reality simulations can even induce similar feelings on Earth. Still, the idea that the cosmos—or Earth—might "communicate" through light offers a poetic bridge between science and ancient wisdom. -->
