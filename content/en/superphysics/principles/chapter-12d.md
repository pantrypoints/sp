The cause of error in science is the imposition of universal objectivity. 

The problem is that:
- Objectivity is from the negative force
- Existence is mostly positive and therefore subjective

So science itself is negative or evil (if we associate the Negative Force with evil). 


The cause of error in Western philosophy is the lack of samadhi among its leading philosophers.

By reading what is known from Thales to Hegel, it is obvious that very few Western philosophers have had samadhi or the direct experience of the Supreme Entity. 

Only the following seems to show symptoms of having experienced samadhi:

1. Pythagoras
2. Socrates
3. Descartes

Pythagoras was known to have some special power/s which support an enlightened state of mind. But these are way inferior to Asian philosophers from Patanjali to Ramakrishna and Yogananda. 



For example, Yogananda's account of Sri Yukteswar's lifetrons and astra and causal realms are essential in us coming up with the 5 metaphysical layers of causal, essential, astral, subtle, and crude. 

 <!-- spiritual technique which leads to spiritual tradition that sustains itself.  -->


The lack of samadhi in the West is from the lack of technique which is from the lack of a teacher. 

The main enlightened teacher in Western philosophy seemed to be Pythagoras. 

Jesus only taught for 3 short years, which is useless since metaphysical skills take years and even lifetimes to develop. 

In contrast, there are many gurus in Asia such as:
- Shiva
- Krishna
- Buddha
- Mahavira
- Patanjali
- Sikh gurus
- Taoist masters
- Yogananda
- Sai Baba
- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
- PR Sarkar
- etc

Buddha was known for both an original philosophy and for having various occult powers.

This is why advanced souls might choose to incarnate in India which has a relative abundnace of gurus to help advanced souls pick up where they left off in the past life.

## Concepts that Superphysics Destroys

The unification of metaphysical and physical perceptions leads to the removal of confused or redundant concepts that arise from materialist thinking locking itself out of metaphysics. 

This locking out creates the need to create new words such as ontology, epistemology, etc which are unnecessary in the united paradigm. 

1. Ontology 

This means study of existence. This is already covered by philosophy. 

Ontology was created in the 17th century in Europe because Germany was separating itself from the Catholic Church and so needed a new intellectual basis for its reasoning. 


2. Epistemology 

This means study of knowledge. This is already covered by philosophy. 

Epistemology had to be created in the 19th century because metaphysics was separated from physics when natural philosophy was converted into science.


3. Monopsony

The word 'monopsony' was invented by Joan Robinson in 1933 as a response to monopolies in the US in the 1920s. 

A monopsony is a market with a single buyer. An example is a farming system where there is only:
- one contract buyer for all the crops or
- one trader to buy all crops to be sold to the city

Instead of monopsony, the proper word would be "monopoly buyer", just as 'monopoly' nowadays really is "monopoly seller".

This is because in the 17th century, foreign trade was in barter.

So a monopolist would be both a giver and taker at the same time.
