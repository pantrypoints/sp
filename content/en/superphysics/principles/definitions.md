<!-- A soul is a mind separated from the body or brain. A mind is consciousness in active form made of three parts: ego (Sanskrit aham), mental field (Sanskrit citta) and its object (thought). ‘Cogito ergo sum’ has all three. Plants and animals have all three too and therefore have a soul, but most humans are just unable to put their egos into the ego of a plant or animal to verify this.  -->

## Mind, Soul, Spirit, Essence

A mind is a colection of waves that persist together as a node. 

A living mind is a node that has more subtle waves that allow independent expression. 

A non-living mind is a node that has more crude waves that prevent independent expression.

A soul is a mind that is regarded without its crude parts. This is called atman in Sanskrit.

A spirit is a mind in active form with waves of forces and feelings flowing through it. 

This is why we say a man is "spirited" if he is active, but "full of soul" if he is deep.

'Evil" really comes from the effects or properties of the Negative Force. So evil spirit or evil person is possible, but evil soul or evil atman is not.  

Essence is the core waves that make up the node.
