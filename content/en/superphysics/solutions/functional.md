An economic system that 'streams' value in order to make blockages obsolete.

Insted of abstract objects that interact with each other through methods, the program is one long chain of functions that process and pass data and values between each other. It reminds of BASIC which was the first language I learned.

I had a hard time understanding classes because why 'group' or 'idea'

Instead of 'classes' it would've been better to call them ideas so that class User with an instane of John because idea User with a thought as John.  

The Elixir community is much smaller than the Golang community and is not backed by any giant company. nature as a functional language and not an object-oriented one. matches our Superphysics paradigm that reality is a stream of data-waves as feelings that create information-objects as matter. A functional language would therefore align with our dharma (inherent nature)
