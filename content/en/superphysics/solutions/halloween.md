Halloween and Christmas have their origins in the comet that destroyed Atlantis. 

- Noah was an Atlantean who made an ark to ride the tsunami east, eventually landing in the Palestine area


#### The Comet Impact as the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

 <!-- the Fall of Atlantis -->

This was noted in Plato's dialogues *Timaeus* and *Critias*


 a powerful civilization—often identified with the legendary Atlantis—existed in the Atlantic region. This advanced society was destroyed in a single day and night by earthquakes and floods around 9,600 BC (roughly 11,600 years ago).

Modern research on the **** suggests that around 12,800–10,900 BC, fragments of a disintegrating comet struck Earth, causing widespread wildfires, a sudden "impact winter," megafauna extinctions, and rapid climate cooling. This event aligns with Plato's timeline and could have triggered massive tsunamis, flooding coastal areas in the Americas and Western Africa while the Mediterranean diverted waters toward the Black Sea.

In Plato's *Timaeus*, an Egyptian priest from Sais recounts to Solon how the Nile preserved Egypt during such calamities: "From this calamity, the Nile delivered and preserved us!" This highlights Egypt's survival amid global floods, possibly sparing Mediterranean and European coastal cities.

#### Cultural Memories in Festivals
Survivors and their descendants remembered the catastrophe through seasonal festivals:

- **Samhain** (Celtic, October 31–November 1): A festival marking the end of harvest and the start of winter, associated with honoring the dead and warding off spirits. Celts and Mexicans (via the **Day of the Dead**) commemorated the tsunami's devastation on November 1, when the dead were believed to return.

- **Saturnalia** (Roman, mid-December): Celebrated the end of the floods and stabilization of the seas after over a month of chaos. This festival of feasting, gift-giving, and role reversal influenced later Christmas traditions.

As the Roman Empire spread, these merged with Christian holidays: Samhain became Halloween (All Hallows' Eve), and Saturnalia's December festivities influenced Christmas.

#### A Modern Proposal: Reimagining the Holidays
To honor the original meaning while promoting unity:

- Replace Halloween with **Calamity Day** on November 1: A day to remember victims of wars, disasters, and historical cataclysms, fostering reflection on human fragility.

- Replace Christmas with **Global Unity Day** on December 25: Celebrate foreign cultures through costumes, food, music, and traditions. Santa costumes remain valid as a nod to Roman Empire influence (much like manga cosplay honors Japanese culture).

This shift reframes the holidays as reminders of shared history: the immense power of empires like Rome to spread languages, calendars, religions, and systems (e.g., Capitalism and Communism), while encouraging cross-cultural exchange over division.

This perspective, while speculative, draws from Plato's ancient texts, geological evidence of cataclysmic events, and the evolution of festivals. It invites us to view these holidays not just as fun, but as echoes of a distant, transformative catastrophe.
