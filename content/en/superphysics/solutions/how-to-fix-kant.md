<!-- ![Poor Philosophy student](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/philostudent.jpg) -->

In a previous post, we explained that Kant destroyed Philosophy by using wrong definitions which then made his system useless. To prove its uselessness, let's translate his strange definitions into ordinary English: 

<!-- Since Kant's system is useless, then the best solution is to do nothing about it. Do not bother reading it just as you wouldn't bother counting to infinity orhow many angels can fit on a pin, all of which have nothing to do with reality and are really of Pure Imagination.

Instead of wasting mental energy trying to understand Kant's overthinking mind, 

 study things that areactually usefulin the real world, like science, math, anddialectics(discussing ideas with others with a specific goal in mind as thesis, iterating with every opinion or failure as antithesis until you get it right as synthesis). These can lead to real innovations and solutions for the many problems that are cropping up.

If a person wants to have the truth or knowledge of the Transendental Ideal, then Eastern Philosophy is the way to go, as it can give a directa posteriori  knowledge of the Ideal through the experience of Samadhi,  Nirvana,   orsatori  and can even do itfree of charge.The only catch is that you pay with yourego, which is the most expensive and fundamental part of one's soul, symbolized bytaking the red pill in the Matrix).

This is infinitely better than giving away real money or getting into debt to enter a philosophy college in exchange for useless knowledge of epistemology. In contrast, the knowledge of Eastern philosophy can help people improve the real world, such as Steve Jobs getting his trillion-dollar product philosophy by going to an ashram in India, and Japanese CEOs getting their management skills from Buddhism.

<!-- 
In a previous post, I exposed the sophistry of Kant'sa priori  ideas, saying that they are really *a posteriori* ideas from other people, because my reasoning was based on the traditional definitions:

I couldn't understand why Kantians objected to this, until I realized that they have accepted in their minds totally different meanings of words created by Kant:
- Kantian a priori means within the mind only
- Kantiana posteriori  means outside of the mind


Kant's use of strange words makes his work difficult to understand. So I change the terms to a more consistent-easy-to-understand version:
 -->
| **Original English** | **Layman's English** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Transcendental | Metaphysical | Beyond physicality |
| subject | main | idea |
| predicate | sub-idea | Connected to the main idea |
| intuitions | passive knowings | The mind arrives at the thought automatically, the mind is like an apple falling effortlessly |
| conceptions | active knowings | The mind makes an effort to create the thought, the mind is like an airplane or bird making an effort to fly |
| analytic | passive-thinking | The passive effort of the mind to connect ideas (rather than using 'union' or 'division', this paradigm uses 'energy') |
| synthetic | active-thinking | The active effort of the mind to connect ideas beyond what it is immedately connectable (forming things takes more energy than smashing them to pieces, fusion needs more energy that fission)|
| analytic judgement | passive-thinking judgement | like a CPU getting data easily from RAM |
| synthetic judgement | active-thinking judgement | like a CPU getting data from the Hard disk or other inputs as external experiences with more effort |
| a priori | confined-to-the-mind | Mind does not look outward |
| a posteriori | mind-goes-out | Mind looking externally |
| synthetic judgement a priori | active-thinking judgement confined-to-the-mind | like a CPU getting data from the Hard Disk, or a person thinking seriously alone|

This converts the confusing word "synthetic a priori judgements" into "judgements made from active thought confined within the mind", or for brevity, "active-thinking judgements confined-to-the-mind". This includes any serious thought, problem solving, and even prayer or meditation that is supposed to output an answer.

This simplifies the statement:

> **Geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically, and yet à priori.**

into:

> **Geometry determines the properties of space through active-thinking, yet confined-to-the-mind.**

Much easier, huh?

With geometry, you can think of whatever shapes inside your mind and it would be fine. But you can't do the same with geology or chemistry. But why did Kant end up having to create so many weird new concepts anyway?


### A Natural Consequence of Denying Experience, Feeling, and Reality

![Ayn Rand vs Kant](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/randkant.jpg)

<!-- who inspired Kant to write his work, -->
According to David Hume, all thinking is based on feelings. 

If a computer were a thinking being, then its electricity would be its feeling. A computer with no electricity cannot think and is technically dead, but once electricity runs through it, it becomes 'alive' and starts to process logic in its virtual memory.

For some reason, Kant denies reality in order to focus purely on the virtual by cutting off all experience and feeling. This is similar to unplugging a computer to see how a computer would run all by itself. 

Instead of relying on an external power source or external experiences and feelings, he imbues the mind or computer with that power **directly from his own mind**, by assigning new qualities and dimensions to its processes:


Thinking Process Factor | Quality 1 | Quality 2
--- | --- | ---
Energy | Synthetic (active) | Analytic (passive)
Effort | Conception (active) | Intuition (passive)
Scope or Location | a posteriori (outside the mind) | a priori (within the mind)


It's similar to Islam banning interest on loans, which causes it to be transferred as rent as a workaround or roundabout solution, and then creating processes to regulate rent, as a bloated complex idea called Shariah banking. 

Kant bans reality and so he has to recreate everything himself. This is why Kant must have the highest regard for his own mind (since it's the one that powers everything in his Kant-only-reality):
<!-- Transcendental Analytic, Transcendental Dialectic, and Transcendental Idealism -->

{{< q a="kant" >}}
The reality of the object of our internal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clear immediately through consciousness. External objects in space might be a mere delusion. But the object of my internal perception is undeniably real.
{{< /q >}}


### Probably a German Thing

Instead of basing the judgement on strong or weak feelings or sensations and their location or distance from the self, **Kant adds strength or weakness and distance on the thinking action itself**. This is why he has to painstakingly specify whether each thought process <!-- that led to a conclusion --> was:
- high energy (active thinking)
- low energy (passive thinking)
- was confined (a priori)
- not confined (a posteriori)

Mechanically, it would be like totally denying the relation of gasoline consumption to engine power, or electrical consumption to CPU speed with the belief that the engine power and CPU speed can run by themselves, or that the mind exists for or by itself (as "I think"). These then leads to obvious fallacies in his explanation of the nature of time, existence, and, more importantly, of morals<!-- , which I can explain in future posts -->.

Hegel and Marx as similarly-complicated-writers who write so much but have relatively little meat or valuable thought. All of this makes us pity the philosophy students who try to understand Kant. 

{{< q a="Kant" >}}
The Germans are the only people who at present use this word to indicate what others call the critique of taste.

## The Useless Theory of General Relativity

The most disastrous product of this strange German mentality is Albert Einstein who used Kant-style thinking to create the Theory of Relativity, which is totally arbitrary. 

{{< q a="Einstein-sophist" >}}
This only requirement for this "way of thinking" is for it to be useful. The objective factor is our perceptions. 

Physical thinking justifies itself by its ability to grasp experiences intellectually, giving us “knowledge of the real.”

This “real” in physics is to be taken as a type of program, to which we are, however, not forced to cling a priori. 

The theoretical attitude that I advocate here <b><i>is distinct from that of Kant only in the sense that this way of thinking is not unalterable. Rather it is based on free conventions.</i></b> 
{{< /q >}}


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/general.jpg" alt="fallacy" cap="The fallacies of the Kantian way of thinking is now seen in General Relativity which allows any physicist to create his own spacetime and Big Bang theory" >}}

Like Kant, Einstein used his own mind to assign reality to spacetime by turning it into a fabric that dictates how the universe moves, expands, is warped, etc. This then allows physicists to create their own spacetimes according to their own imagination:

- Walker created a universe with Robertson-Walker spacetime
- De Sitter created a De Sitter spacetime
- Godel created <!-- Kurt --> a Godel universe
- Taub led to a universe with Taub-NUT spacetime 
- Penrose created a cyclical universe as Conformal Cyclic Cosmology 


### Useless Kant, Useless Einstein, Useless Physics

Some of those physicists then get Nobel prizes for theories that have no reality. This is similar to:
- academics who peddle useless courses or degrees that students pay for with real money
- crypto startups which peddle gradiose ideas powered by useless cryptocurrency or NFTs 

This useless Einsteinian physics is totally opposite of ancient physics (from the ancient Greeks to Descartes) which already concluded that spacetime is an illusion and has no reality.

Newton's physics created so many technologies that we still use today. But Einstein physics only claims global positioning satellites (GPS) as its product. Einstein's supporters ignore the fact that engineers would have perceived the time-differences in their satellites and made the adjustments themselves without needing the idea of a spacetime fabric*.



{{< n n="*Instead of a fabric, we assign the cause of time dilation to the aether, as explained by the ancients." >}}
 


We pity the physicists wasting their time trying to unify Quantum Physics and General Relativity as String Theories which are practically useless. 

<!--  and finding out the structure of the universe all from the sophistical Theory of Relativity, just it is sad to see:
- students spending real money studying Epistemology instead of something useful like data science or programming. 
- people 'investing' in cryptocurrencies or NFTs instead of investing in real businesses -->

<!-- {{< img src="/graphics/tokamak.jpg" alt="Tokamak" cap="According to our Theory of Universal Relativity, artificial gravity is essential for fusion. But this is not achieved because physicists have adopted Einstein's Relativity which is useless in creating artificial gravity. As a result, the proper alternative to fossil fuels does not exist. This then leads to global warming and real death and destruction." >}} -->

In a free society, it is alright to allow sophistical theories. But it is totally wrong to decree that such wrong theories are correct, and that the wrong way is the right way. Doing so would be like to guiding people onto a cliff, as is happening to the current world which has no solution to global warming, overpopulation, stagflation, war, or mass extinction. 



<!-- This makes Kant's principles useless. Its core principle is his concept of a priori knowledge. Destroying this idea will then naturally lead to the destruction of its abstract child ideas such as: 
- Transcendental Analytic
- Transcendental Dialectic
- Transcendental Idealism

The invention of these confused, junk ideas led to Epistemology which is supposed to parse fact from fiction, but is actually equally useless. This is because this was already done by the [study of Logic](/superphysics/principles/chapter-11c/).

Epistemology took the place of traditional philosophy effectively killing it. This explains why junk philosophies sprang up during the 19th century:
- Nazism led to the Holocaust which destroyed many people
- Marxism led to the violent Communist Revolution
- Utilitarianism led to marginal utility, profit maximization, and consumerism which are destroying the planet  

{{< q a="Socrates" c="Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 6 Chapter 1" >}}
This philosopher class is where the authors of the greatest good or evil come from. But a small man never does any great thing to others. So philosophy is left desolate. Her own devotees have fallen away and forsaken her. Other unworthy persons see that she has no protectors so they enter and dishonour her.. Philosophy thus becomes evil.
{{< /q >}}

Our goal is to wipe out Epistemology (and its religious version Ontology) from the face of the Earth by bringing back the original Logic, Moral Philosophy, and Dialectics to release philosophy from its current shackles. Once freed, it can be used to solve the growing number of modern problems such as pandemics, terrorism, inequality, global warming, overpopulation, etc, all created by the evil philosophies of the 19th century.

{{< q a="Ibn-Khaldun" c="Muqaddimah, Chapter 6, Part 37" >}}
The occupation with the auxiliary sciences [logic] constitutes a waste of one's life, occupation with something that is of no concern.
