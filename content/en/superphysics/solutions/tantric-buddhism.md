Yesterday was a huge day in local Buddhism because 2 relics from Sri Lanka, 2 tiny sets of ashes that are believed to be from the Buddha, were transferred to the country as part of Vesak celebrations. 

Local Buddhists could now view those relics up close and make offerings and pay their respects to them. 


## Venerating Relics are ~~Dogma~~ Not Dogma

I first saw this practice in Singapore where a temple held a grand ceremony for a tooth which was supposed to be from the Buddha. I learned in Catholic school that venerating objects was idolatry. So the shallow, indoctrinated part of me felt that those Buddhists were fools for bowing to such objects, just because their monks said they were from the Buddha. 

I went to the event to soak up on the Vesak vibe to increase spiritual energies, merely taking photos of the 2 relics which I did not believe in.

At the end of the viewing event, the relics were to be carried to the 3rd floor to be kept inside a sealed container. However, the organizers allowed the audience to touch them before they were sealed up. That's when I got the urge to crowd around them and touch one myself.

I put my two hands on one relic and instantly felt a soothing electricity flow from my left hand to my heart. For no reason, my eyes started to form tears. I wanted to touch the 2nd relic but I found myself fighting the urge to fall to the floor and cry. That hesitation allowed other people to gang up on the 2nd relic blocking it away from me for good. 

I sat at the back crying for 15 minutes because that electricity instantly removed the burdens from my heart, accumulated since my previous samadhi around 2009. It directly assured me that I was on the right path. 

Previously, the only assurances that I got were indirect 'sychronicities' such as the global price inflation happening when my model predicted it, strangers helping out my startup, etc. 

But this was the first time I got a assurance from direct physical contact with an object.

Moreover, after 5 minutes from the electric shock, I felt my throat throbbing. My guru wrote that among Buddha's unique trait was his masterful control of his throat chakra. So I closed my eyes and did pratyahara (sense-withdrawal) to 'see' what was going on. Then I got the idea for a meditation technique that uses the throat chakra.

My current path focuses on the heart chakra to detect the aether or akasha. This is consistent with Rene Descartes' Treatise on Man which says that the heart is the detector for the aethereal "[animal spirits](/research/descartes/man/section-05)" (which is 'pranah' in Hinduism and chi and in Taoism). 

But after the 20th year or so of meditation, I found aether-detection to be second nature and a bit boring. The next step was to find something to do with whatever was detected. 

For this, I had to tap the upper chakras:
- throat
- ajna
- crown

I had tried to jump to those chakras from the heart but found the results very inconsistent as to be useless. The best things that I could get from that techinque are the ideas for my proposed science of Superphysics, which is purely theoretical and quite useless until more people adopt it to make practical experiments and apply the benefits in their lives.

But after getting the vibe from that relic, I had the idea to use the throat chakra as a jump-off point instead of the heart. I tried it this morning and it clearly had an effect. But it would take a lot more repetitions to see the pattern that forms from the effects. 

This whole experience leads to 4 insights:

### 1. The importance of discipline against the logical mind

One week ago, my intuitional mind told me to be totally vegetarian since this Vesak would be special compared to previous ones. Yet my logical mind did not believe it and so I ate fish and egg once. But the effect or *karma* of this was to make my mind crude, that it was easily overwhelmed by the 1st relic and so I was not able to touch the 2nd one. 

This shows the importance of keeping discipline up, and empowering the intuitional (higher) mind to override the logical (lower) mind. 

The logical mind had no ability to see the future and so it would not make sense to make it the captain of the soul. Spiritual discipline pushes down the logical mind to the bottom where it belongs so that the intuitional mind can properly take the helm, so that the soul flows with Nature (Tao) and not against It.   

This is most obvious in fasting wherein the logical urge to eat when hungry is overriden by the spiritual desire to clean up one's mind and body. 


## 2. Detecting God

I started the event as a non-believer in Buddhist relics, frowning on people who bow down to such objects. I ended the event totally opposite, giving the biggest respects to them.

Most people touch them and feel nothing. I met only one person in the event who felt something, so I checked her palm and [her lines](/research/benham/palmistry/part-2/chapter-14b-intuition) showed her to have inherent clairvoyant ability.

It follows that the problem with seeing or proving the existence of God (or the Aether which is the substance of God in Spinoza-speak), is not a problem with God or the Aether. **It is really a problem with that person's lack of detection ability.** 

A person will lack that detection ability if his mind prefers to detect and constantly surround itself with crude material objects such as money, expensive cars, delicious food, big houses, enjoyable video games, etc. This catapults the logical mind to the top and buries intuition. 

The common cosequence or karma is that such a person gets thrown around by chance and the events in life, just as a ship easily gets tossed around by rough waters. 

If the person is a Christian, he will likely turn to Jesus to save him from his problems. This really injects **positive thinking** into his mind which then calms the ocean of trouble a bit, just enough for him to get through that rough part in his life. But this is really a workaround to the problem and not a solution, and so the problems will come up again eventually. 


### 3. Aether versus Electricity

The relics are supposed to have been around for thousands of years. If touching them transferred energy away, then they should be so impotent by now. Yet they still have the same potency from the time of Buddha. 

It follows that the energy is aethereal and not electromagnetic, and so the Law of Conservation of Energy does not apply. 

Instead, Superphysics has the concept of the [Law of Conservation of Idea](/superphysics/principles/chapter-05) which says each idea is unique and preserves its potency, unchanged through time or contact. 

This is how ideas and philosophies can inspire people and give them energy over and over, since ideas are made up of the aether. 

For example, the many troubles of the Roman empire, surrounded by barbarians, and the Jews, surrounded by Babylonians, Assyrians, etc. led to the idea of a Savior. This same idea appeals to many modern people who are surrounded by many problems in life.   


### 4. Tantric Buddhism as global warming solution

The Muslim Arabs feel no remorse pumping CO2 from their oil and gas industry. Catholics have no problem eating meat that also pumps CO2 through the livestock industry. Only Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism are inherently anti-consumption (to reduce energy use), and anti-meat (to reduce CO2 from livestock). 

So there is a double reason to push for them: 

1. For spiritual advancement
2. To stop global warming

Hinduism is so unimpressive because of its perceived polytheism, dogma, as well as the widespread poverty in India. 

Taoist texts and practices are mostly in the Chinese language which is very hard to read and understand. Moreover, hungry ghosts and feng shui are associated with superstition.  

That leaves Buddhism as the more attractive option -- Japan and Singapore are wealthy because of the hardwork and discipline of East Asians, and Thailand is a popular place for travel and relocation compared to India. 

But the problem with Buddhism is that it is nihilist and soul-less. Instead of using the common-sense soul as the basis of its philosophy, it uses Non-Existence or Void. 

This is way too abstract for most humans and is as difficult as explaining Quantum Physics to a child. On the flipside, a deep understading of Buddhism makes Quantum Physics easier (just as Taoism makes Quantum Mechanics easier). 

This nihilism kept me "on the fence" regarding Buddhism. But after experiencing the relic, I can easily push it aside as a non-issue. 

I think that Buddha opted for the soul-less approach after seeing that dogmatic Hinduism was squatting on the ideas of the soul (atman) and existence (brahma). The soul-less and non-existence areas were unoccupied and so it made sense to base a rival non-dogmatic philosophy there.

The nihilism of Buddhism is cured by injecting Tantra (a Hindu sect), leading to Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism. Tantra is based on the soul and existence with 2 forces Shiva-Shakti. In this way, you get the Taoist bonus of Yin-Yang too. 

This creates a complete system that much more practical and not so abtract. Rather, as a moral system, it can be the jumping-off point for practical solutions and policies against global warming.
