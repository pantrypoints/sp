"Extension" is Descartes-speak for metaphysical space. 

"Space" is physical space. 

Spinoza's assertions are based on Descartes who proposed that God is Everything, both physical and metaphysical. This everythingness manifests as metaphysical extension and physical space. "There is no Void" simply means "God is Everywhere".

Everything is just space that has modes. For example, an atom is 99% space and 1% particles. The particles are then modes of space or extension. So Spinoza was way ahead of everyone by saying everything is space. 

This space in Descartes' Physics is the 2nd Element (which is spacetime or gravitons in modern Physics) which itself is a mode of the aether, which is the substance of God. 

In Hinduism, this substance is called citta or mind-stuff. Descartes' did not expound on this new aethereal God, fearing the Church response. So Spinoza did it for him.  

In a nutshell, photons do not occupy physical space as point-particles in modern Physics. They do so as a wave. But in both cases, they have extension, since the basis of the extension is the aether which is a theory from Descartes and not Spinoza. 

Spinoza's best assertions that are proven by particle physics is:
1. Atoms are divisible - this has been proven by particle colliders
2. Everything is mostly space - atoms are 99% empty space

The small parts of terrestrial bodies are not made up of atoms or indivisible particles. Rather, they are all made of the same subtle matter, which could be divided again in an infinite number of ways. They differ from each other like stones of various shapes that have been cut from the same rock.
