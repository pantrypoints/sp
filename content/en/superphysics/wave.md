Superphysics is the paradigm that sees the universe as being made up of waves. This is derived from David Hume's *Treatise of Human Nature* which categorizes all our perceptions as being either:
- ideas or
- imressions. 

Superphysics translates ideas into metaphysical idea-objects and impressions into metapyhsical feelings. 

Ideas have the dynamics of particles, Feelings have the dynamics of waves.

This then creates a wave-particle duality in realm of metaphysics which is consistent with the wave-particle duality in physics. 

Waves differ from lines and curves in terms of the number of forces acting on it.
- A line has no force acting on it, causing it to be straight 
- A curve is a line with one force acting on it causing it to bend according to that force
- A wave is a line that has 2 forces constantly acting on it in an alternating way, causing it to have alternating curves as a waveform

The wave-nature of physics and metapyhsics means that ther are 2 forces acting on existence at all times.

Since this principle is fundamental to existence, then there must be some existing philosophy to exlain such forces  

Fortunately, such philosophies exist. 

- Taoism has the concept of the forces of Yang and Yin.
- Tantric Hinduism has the concept of forces of Shiva and Shakti.

Superphysics then is the paradigm that exlains how these 2 forces create both physical and metaphysical phenomena.

- Material Superhysics exlains physical phenomena.
- Social Superphysics explains metaphysical phenomena as the changing feelings within societies. 
- Bio Superphysics explains phenomena that is in between the physical and metaphysical as the interaction of living organisms with the material environment.


We now have a framework for solving prpblems in physics, society, and health by using it to anaylze cause and effect.

This is why Hume says that this system will be superior to science in terms of usefullness.
